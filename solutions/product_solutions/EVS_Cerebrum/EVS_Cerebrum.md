# The EVS Cerebrum app

Cerebrum is a Broadcast Control System from EVS designed for flexible control and monitoring of broadcast environments. Its integration with DataMiner allows for reading and setting crosspoints, salvos, and mnemonics.

DataMiner typically acts as a top-level orchestration platform in projects, managing the complete lifecycle of services, productions, and events. This includes secure onboarding of resources, infrastructure monitoring, and managing both physical and virtual resources in terms of connectivity, capacity, and availability.

For event preparation, DataMiner establishes connectivity by setting crosspoints between pre-reserved resources, such as pre-configuring feeds for fiber contribution jobs in the MCR. Crosspoint commands are sent to Cerebrum for this purpose.

To set these crosspoints easily and intuitively, the EVS Cerebrum application enables you to select the router level, source, and destination to establish a route connection.
