# The DataMiner TAG Management application

The DataMiner TAG Management application allows you to monitor and control individual TAG MCM devices and Media Control Systems (MCS).

![Tag Management app](~/dataminer/images/Tag_Management_app.png)

The TAG Management app seamlessly identifies the device type installed in the system and presents data from either a single MCS or all available MCM elements within the deployed DataMiner System, without the need for any additional user configuration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For optimal utilization of the app's capabilities, we highly recommend using TAG's Media Control System (MCS). While TAG MCM alone can sustain the app's functionality, certain information and KPIs may be missing. See [Limitation: missing information](xref:How_to_TAG_App#limitation-missing-information).

The *TAG Management* package, available for download from the Catalog, contains the following items:

- TAG Management low-code app

- TAG Video Systems MCM-9000 connector version 1.1.6.10

- TAG Video Systems Media Control System (MCS) connector version 1.0.2.1

- Automation scripts used in the application to gather data and perform device control operations

For more information about how to install the package, see [Installing the TAG Management app](xref:Installing_TAG_App).

The TAG Management app contains three main pages containing information on the TAG devices. For more information about the user interface and the available functionalities, see [Using the Tag Management application](xref:How_to_TAG_App).
