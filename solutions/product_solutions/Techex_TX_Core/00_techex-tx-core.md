# Techex TX Core app

The Techex TX Core platform (formerly MW Core) manages TXEdges (formerly MW Edge) and captures telemetry data for real-time monitoring. DataMiner interfaces with TX Core through the REST API to manage monitored devices, channels, TX Edges, streams, sources, and outputs. Additionally, you can configure a statistics connection to provide telemetry data for sources and outputs, including ETR290 statistics.

In this context, the Techex TX Core package offers a solution for end-to-end monitoring and orchestration of the TX Core platform and TX Edges from a single pane of glass. Further changes may still be developed to this network orchestration solution package, and it may not yet cover the full feature set of the TX Core and TX Edge products; however, it already provides off-the-shelf monitoring and orchestration of the Techex TX Core platform.
