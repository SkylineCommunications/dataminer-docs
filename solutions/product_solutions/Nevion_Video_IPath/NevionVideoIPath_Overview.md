The Nevion Video IPath app allows you to control Sony's (Nevion) VideoIPath SDN controller, which provides connection management, service assurance, and network inventory capabilities for service provides and broadcasters.

The Nevion Video IPath app retrieves all data from the Nevion VideoIPath system using the [Nevion Video iPath connector](https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/7b986cbc-a29e-44e5-b3b7-003e639acfac), using Nevion’s modern services API calls. It then allows you to schedule, execute, and view connections between endpoints. This will not only establish a routing path but also configures a service that could be set up as point-to-point or point-to-multipoint.

The [*Nevion Video IPath* package](https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/ec97a934-679e-42c2-ac4b-f33a3d9f8d2c), available for download from the Catalog, contains the following items:

- The Nevion Video IPath low-code app

- Nevion Video IPath connector version 1.3.0.7 or higher

- A Visio file that will provide extra visualization and control capabilities in the Monitoring app.

- Automation scripts used in the app to gather data and perform control operations.
