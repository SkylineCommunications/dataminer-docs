# Grass Valley AMPP Manager application

The Grass Valley Agile Media Processing Platform (GV AMPP) Manager application package offers a comprehensive solution for monitoring and controlling workloads and snapshots.

[Deploying the package](xref:GVAMPP_Manager_Installing) from the DataMiner Catalog will install both a low-code app, available from the DataMiner landing page (`https://[DMA]/root/`), and everything you need in order to use that app. The app allows you to select any existing GV AMPP Manager element and immediately access key metrics, statistics, and control options.
