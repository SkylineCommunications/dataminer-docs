# The Smart Trap Processor Tool

> [!TIP]
> See also: [Smart Trap Processor - Use case](https://community.dataminer.services/use-case/smart-trap-processor/).

The Smart Trap Processor tool facilitates the configuration of rules for collecting, processing, and monitoring SNMP-based events from various sources.

Through a unified interface, you can [configure processing rules](xref:Processor_configuration) and [monitor processed traps](xref:Monitoring_Processed_Traps) for any of the processor elements available in the DataMiner System.

With this tool, you can specify which traps to capture, filter, transform, and display in a user-friendly application interface. This simplifies the monitoring of the most important system events and ensures that appropriate alarm levels are assigned. By enabling the team to control message volume, this tool also helps to prevent alert fatigue. The flexible nature of the application allows processing to adapt to most systems or devices generating trap events.

> [!NOTE]
> This tool supports SNMPv1 and SNMPv2, but SNMPv3 is currently not supported.
