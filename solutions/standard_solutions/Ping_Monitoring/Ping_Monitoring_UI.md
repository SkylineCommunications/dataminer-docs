## The Ping Monitoring overview pane

### The 'Destinations' page

The *Destinations* page offers an overview of all IP addresses in your DataMiner System receiving ping commands on a predefined, customized basis.

The following information is available for each destination:

- **Destination address**: The URL or IP address of an internet destination, e.g. *www.skyline.be*.

- **Description**: A brief description provided to the destination, e.g. *Skyline*.

- **Group**: The group the destination belongs to, corresponding to a Generic Ping element, e.g. *Websites*.

- **Admin status**: The status (enabled or disabled) of the destination.

- **Ping result**: The time it took each destination to reply to the last ping command, e.g. *4 ms*.

- **Cycle packet loss**: The percentage of lost packets during ping command and response process, e.g. *0.00 %*.

Clicking the ![additional information](~/dataminer/images/additional_information.png) button displays additional information about the destination, including host information, results, settings, and more.

With the buttons at the top of the page, you can [create, edit, and delete destinations](xref:Ping_Monitoring_managing_groups_destinations#managing-destinations).

### The 'Grid View' page

The *Grid View* page offers a compact grid overview of all destinations, ideal for managing a large number of destinations. The color of each grid tile indicates the associated destination's [alarm severity level](xref:Alarm_types#alarm-severity-levels).

![Grid View](~/dataminer/images/Grid_View_Image.png)

Click any tile in the grid to display additional information about the destination, including host information, results, settings, and more.

### The 'Groups' page

The *Groups* page offers an overview of all active groups, with each group corresponding to a Generic Ping element in your DataMiner System.

This is the main information that is available for each group:

- **# Dst enabled**: The number of enabled destinations in the group.

- **# Dst disabled**: The number of disabled destinations in the group.

- **Current responding ping**: The percentage of destinations responding to ping commands, e.g. *100.00 %*.

- **Average ping time**: The average time it takes for destinations within the group to receive and respond to a ping command, e.g. *11.46 ms*.

Selecting a group in the overview will display all destinations configured within that group in the *Destinations in Selected Group* pane.

![Destinations selected group](~/dataminer/images/Destinations_Selected_Group.png)

Clicking the *Slowest Destinations in Group* button will display any outliers in the groups, i.e. destinations that take a longer time than average to receive and respond to a ping command.

With the buttons at the top of the page, you can [create, edit, and delete groups](xref:Ping_Monitoring_managing_groups_destinations#managing-groups).

### The 'Alarms' page

The *Alarms* page offers an overview of all active alarms in the groups. A filter pane on the left allows you to filter by group.

### The filter pane

On the *Destinations* and *Grid View* pages, a filter pane on the left enables you to narrow down destinations based on their properties.

![Filter pane](~/dataminer/images/Filter_PM.png)

To limit the filter pane to an overview of the currently active filters, enable the toggle button in the top-right corner. Disable the toggle button to return to the full view.

In the lower-left corner, you can see the total destinations as well as the destinations that are currently active in your DataMiner System. Also, a progress bar above those destinations will count down to the next page refresh.
