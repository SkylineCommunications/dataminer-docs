# META WhatsApp Messaging Solution

The META WhatsApp Messaging Solution acts as a link between the [Alarm Console](xref:Working_with_the_Alarm_Console) (1) and the WhatsApp API, allowing alarms to be sent directly to designated users' devices with WhatsApp installed (2).

This solution eliminates the need for constant monitoring of the Alarm Console by support or management teams, enabling authorized personnel to stay informed about system status and respond to issues promptly, regardless of their location.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before installing this solution, ensure that you meet all [prerequisites](xref:META_WhatsApp_Messaging_Installation#prerequisites).
