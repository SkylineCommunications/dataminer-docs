Once it has been deployed, you can find the IP Network Explorer app on the root page of your DataMiner System.

Initially, you may need to start a scan of the network in order to [get started with IP Network Explorer](xref:IpNetworkExplorer_getting_started).

For an overview of the supported infrastructure, refer to [Supported devices and protocols](xref:IpNetworkExplorer_Supported_Devices_And_Protocols).
