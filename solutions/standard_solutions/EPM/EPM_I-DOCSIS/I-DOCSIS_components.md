# EPM Integrated DOCSIS components

## Connectors

### Collector connectors

Collector connectors interface with the main data sources (CMTS and CCAP devices, APIs, etc.). For example, we use collector connectors to poll a CMTS device and obtain the necessary information needed to present DOCSIS data throughout the EPM topology.

While these connectors ship out with the solution packages, they need to be contracted separately as necessary.

For an overview of the available collector connectors, see [Supported technologies for Integrated DOCSIS](xref:I-DOCSIS_supported_technologies).

### EPM connectors

EPM connectors constitute the core of the EPM Solution. They carry out the necessary logic to aggregate and display the information of the different topology levels. EPM connectors rely on collectors and system connectors to feed information into the EPM engine.

These are the required EPM connectors, which are included in the EPM Solution package:

## Automation scripts

The Integrated DOCSIS EPM Solution uses the following Automation scripts:

- **EpmConfig**: Sets the front-end configuration in the DMS to improve topology app performance.
- **EPM_I_DOCSIS_EpmFeToEpmBe**: Operates within the messaging system domain taking care of simple notifications between the EPM front-end element and the back-end elements.
- **EPM_I_DOCSIS_EpmBeToCcapPair**: Operates within the messaging system domain taking care of simple notifications between EPM back-end elements and CCAP collectors.
- **EPM_I_DOCSIS_AddNewCcapCmPair**: Allows the user to create a CCAP/CM pair from the EPM UI.<!-- RN 36459 -->
- **EPM_I_DOCSIS_AddSpectrumCcap**: Streamlines the provisioning of spectrum monitoring elements for CCAP elements.<!-- RN 42366 -->
- **EPM_I_DOCSIS_GQI_GET_ALL_CM_DATA**: Used to retrieve all CM-related data in dashboards using GQI.
- **EPM_I_DOCSIS_GQI_GET_ALL_DS_QAM_DATA**: Used to retrieve all DS QAM Channel-related data in dashboards using GQI.
- **EPM_I_DOCSIS_GQI_GET_ALL_US_QAM_DATA**: Used to retrieve all US QAM Channel-related data in dashboards using GQI.
- **EPM_I_DOCSIS_GQI_GET_ALL_OFDM_DATA**: Used to retrieve all OFDM Channel-related data in dashboards using GQI.
- **EPM_I_DOCSIS_GQI_GET_ALL_OFDMA_DATA**: Used to retrieve all OFDMA Channel-related data in dashboards using GQI.
- **EPM_I_DOCSIS_GQI_GET_ALL_CM_DS_QAM_DATA**: Used to retrieve all CM DS QAM Channel-related data in dashboards using GQI.
- **EPM_I_DOCSIS_GQI_GET_ALL_CM_US_QAM_DATA**: Used to retrieve all CM US QAM Channel-related data in dashboards using GQI.
- **EPM_I_DOCSIS_GQI_GET_ALL_PASSIVE_DATA**: Used to retrieve all Passive relation-related data in dashboards using GQI.
- **EPM_I_DOCSIS_GQI_GET_ALL_OFDM_DATA**: Used to retrieve all OFDM Channel–related data in dashboards using GQI.
- **EPM_I_DOCSIS_GQI_GET_ALL_OFDMA_DATA**: Used to retrieve all OFDMA Channel–related data in dashboards using GQI.
- **EPM_I_DOCSIS_GQI_GET_ALL_UNREACHABLE_CM**: Used to retrieve all CMs unreachable via ping but reported as operational by the CMTS.
- **EPM_I_DOCSIS_SetThresholdsTableToCollectors**: Used to update all collectors of any channel threshold changes made on the front end.
