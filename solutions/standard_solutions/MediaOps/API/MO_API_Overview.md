# MediaOps API

The MediaOps API empowers developers to unlock the full potential of their MediaOps system. Designed for seamless integration, it enables you to automate workflows, interact with the rich information available in your environment, and build custom solutions tailored to your operational needs.

## Getting Started

The primary entry point for the API is the `Skyline.DataMiner.Utils.MediaOps` NuGet package. At this time, the package is available exclusively from our private NuGet store. To obtain access, you will need to request a version of the API. Please note that this is a temporary solution—an improved, publicly available API is in development, which will offer a sleeker experience, full backwards compatibility, and easier access for all users.

> **Compatibility Note:**  
> When using the `Skyline.DataMiner.Utils.MediaOps` NuGet package, ensure that the version you select is compatible with the MediaOps system version you are targeting. For example, MediaOps 1.4.0 requires NuGet version 1.4.1-alpha19.

With the MediaOps API, you can:
- Manage your jobs.
- Handle resource assignments.
- Define capabilities, capacities and configurations.
- Manage workflows.
- Define resources and pools.

Stay tuned for updates on the next-generation API, which will make it even easier to extend and enhance your MediaOps experience.
