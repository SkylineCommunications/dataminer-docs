# Managing organizations

The *Organizations* page focuses on your managed organizations. It allows you to switch between two tabs: *Overview* and *List*, each offering a different perspective on the available organizations.

You can switch between the *Overview* and *List* tabs by clicking *Overview* or *List* in the header bar.

- The *Overview* tab provides a **snapshot of key metrics**, including the most prominent organization categories, the top 5 organizations with the most members, the number of organizations, active organizations, and drafts, and the five most recently added organizations. This tab gives you a quick view of aggregated organizational data.

- The *List* tab provides an **overview of all organizations**, along with their state, number of members, and organization category. This tab allows you to access and review organization details in one centralized location. It also provides an efficient way to filter through the list of organizations based on the provided information.
