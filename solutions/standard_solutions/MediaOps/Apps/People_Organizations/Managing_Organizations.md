# Managing organizations

The *Organizations Overview* page focuses on your managed organizations. It allows you to switch between two tabs: *Overview* and *List*, each offering a different perspective on the available organizations.

You can switch between the *Overview* and *List* tabs by clicking *Overview* and *List* in the header bar of the *Organizations Overview* page.

- The *Overview* tab provides a **snapshot of key metrics**, including the most prominent organization categories, the top 5 organizations with the most members, the number of organizations, deprecated organizations, and drafts, and the five most recently added organizations. This tab gives you a quick view of aggregated organizational data.
