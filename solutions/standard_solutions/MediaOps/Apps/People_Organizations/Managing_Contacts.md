# Managing contacts

The *People* page serves as the application's landing page. It allows you to switch between two tabs: *Overview* and *List*, each offering a different perspective on your contacts.

You can switch between the *Overview* and *List* tabs by clicking *Overview* or *List* in the header bar.

- The *Overview* tab provides a **snapshot of key metrics**, including the top 5 individuals in multiple teams, the most available skills, the number of contacts, active contacts, and drafts, and the five most recently added contacts. This tab gives you a quick view of important information.

- The *List* tab provides an **overview of all contacts**, along with their state, email address, skill, experience level, and organization name. This tab allows you to access and review contact details in one centralized location. It also provides an efficient way to filter through the list of contacts based on the provided contact information.

  To obtain more information about a specific contact, click the ![Details](~/solutions/images/PO_Details.png) button in the corresponding row of the list.

## Adding a new contact

To add a new contact:

1. Navigate to the *List* tab.

1. In the header bar, select *+ New contact*.

1. Provide the necessary people and contact information, and select an organization.

   Note that if you do not select an organization yet at this point, you can always [add the contact to an organization](xref:PO_Managing_Organizations#configuring-organization-members) later.

1. Select *Save* in the top-right corner of the panel.

   The *Drafts* panel will open. The new contact is now saved as a draft.

   - If you want to activate your new contact, select the contact in the *Drafts* panel and click *Activate Selected* in the top-left corner of the pane, or click *Activate All* to activate all the current drafts.

   - If you want to activate your new contact later, close the panel with the "X" in the top-right corner. Later on, when you want to activate the contact, you can open the panel again via the *Drafts* button in the header bar of the *List* tab.

## Editing a contact

To edit an existing contact:

1. Navigate to the *List* tab.

   A panel will appear.

1. Select *Edit* in the lower-right corner of the panel.

1. Make the necessary changes to the contact details.

## Deprecating a contact

To deprecate an existing contact:

   An overview of all deprecated contacts will be shown. This will include the contact you have just deprecated.

## Managing skills

## Managing experience

On both the *Overview* and *List* tabs, you can access the *Experience* panel by clicking the *Experience* button in the header bar.

Assigning experience to individuals streamlines the booking process by making it easier to match people with tasks that suit their level of expertise.

To assign experience, enter the appropriate experience entry in the *Experience level* field when you [create a new contact](#adding-a-new-contact) or [edit an existing contact](#editing-a-contact).
