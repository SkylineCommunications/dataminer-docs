# Managing teams

The *Teams* page focuses on your managed teams. It allows you to switch between two tabs: *Overview* and *List*, each offering a different perspective on the available teams.

![Header bar](~/solutions/images/Teams_Header_Bar.png)

- The *Overview* tab provides a **snapshot of key metrics**, including the teams with the most people, the number of teams, active teams, and drafts, and the most recently added teams. This tab gives you a quick view of important information.

- The *List* tab provides an **overview of all teams**, along with their state, bookable status, number of members, team email address, team description, and skills. This tab allows you to access and review team details in one centralized location.

  With the magnifying glass icon above the list, you can also add a quick filter to look for specific teams in the list.

## Adding a new team
