# Creating workflows

To create workflows, you can use the *New* button in the header bar of the Workflow Designer.

Next to creating a workflow from scratch, there is also an option to start from an existing workflow by duplicating it from the context menu on the *Home* page.

Once the workflow is created it will appear in the list of workflows on the *Home* page in the [Draft state](xref:WFD_Workflow_States). To update the workflow settings, **specify the resources** required, how they are linked to each other, as well as provide **default configuration** settings, you can use the pencil icon to open the [Edit workflow panel](xref:WFD_Edit_Workflow).
