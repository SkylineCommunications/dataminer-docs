# MediaOps Job States

A job can have one of the following states:

| State | Description |
|--|--|
| <div style="background-color:#9140D9;color:#FFFFFF;width:150px;text-align:center;margin:10px;margin-top:20px">Draft</div> | Unless a job is created based on a specific resource, it starts off in the draft state. This allows you to create a provisionary job without actually booking any of the resources. |
| <div style="background-color:#F7EC15;color:#000000;width:150px;text-align:center;margin:10px;margin-top:20px">Tentative</div> | When a job moves into the tentative state, the resources assigned to the job will be reserved to prevent other jobs from selecting the same resources. |
| <div style="background-color:#348D42;color:#FFFFFF;width:150px;text-align:center;margin:10px;margin-top:20px">Confirmed</div> | When a job is fully configured and ready to be executed, it should be set to confirmed. |
| <div style="background-color:#4CEF8E;color:#000000;width:150px;text-align:center;margin:10px;margin-top:20px">Running</div> | When a job has been confirmed and its configured start time occurs, the job will move to the running state. This indicates that the job is live. |
| <div style="background-color:#4A41E6;color:#FFFFFF;width:150px;text-align:center;margin:10px;margin-top:20px">Completed</div> | When a running job stops, it will go to the completed state, indicating that the job has ended. A completed job can be deleted via the ... icon for the job on any of the pages in the app.<!-- RN 43036 --> |
| <div style="background-color:#D60000;color:#FFFFFF;width:150px;text-align:center;margin:10px;margin-top:20px">Error</div> | If there is an error on a job, it will be displayed with this color. However, underlying this, it will still have one of the above states, which will still be shown in the [edit panel](xref:SCH_Edit_Job). For more info, refer to [Validation of upcoming jobs](xref:Overview_MediaOps_Validation). |

> [!NOTE]
> When a job that has not started yet is no longer needed, it can be canceled via the [Edit job](xref:SCH_Edit_Job) panel, which will move it to a **canceled** state. However, canceled jobs are not displayed on most pages. You can only find them on the *Search Jobs* page.

<div style="background-color:#36F0F3;color:#000000;width:150px;text-align:center;margin:10px;margin-top:20px">Ready for invoice</div>

Ready for invoice means that all changes are final and therefor it is no longer allowed to make any changes to the job.

<div style="background-color:#529495;color:#FFFFFF;width:150px;text-align:center;margin:10px;margin-top:20px">Invoiced</div>

Invoiced is the final state of a job, but it does not mean that all jobs will reach this state.

<div style="background-color:#FC7D76;color:#000000;width:150px;text-align:center;margin:10px;margin-top:20px">Canceled</div>

Here is an overview of how these different states are connected:
