# App settings

On the About page of the Asset Manager app, you can view and edit the app settings.

![Asset Manager About page](~/solutions/images/Asset_Manager_About_page.png)

- The **Enable Asset History** and **Enable Connection History** options determine whether asset and connection changes are tracked. If these are enabled, the history of assets and connections is displayed on the History page of the app.

- The **Plan and Build Job Prompt** field allows you to define if you want to be prompted with the possibility to create a job every time you make any change in the Asset Manager (editing assets, creating connections, etc.). These jobs can be managed in the [Plan and Build app](xref:Plan_And_Build).

- The **Max History Entries** setting determines the maximum number of history records that will be kept, while the **History TTL** setting determines for how many days history records are kept.
