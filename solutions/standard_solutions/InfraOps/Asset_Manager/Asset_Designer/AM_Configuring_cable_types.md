# Configuring cable types

To define the type of cables available when establishing data/network connections between assets, click *Cable Types* in the header bar of the Asset Designer page.

The solution comes with a predefined list of cable types that you can configure and expand as needed:

You can add a cable type with the *Add Cable Type* button at the top of the *Cable types* pane, or edit an existing cable type by clicking the relevant ![Hamburger icon](~/solutions/images/PB_Hamburger_icon.png) icon in the table and selecting *Edit Cable Type*.

When you configure a cable type:

- Make sure the cable type **name** is unique.
- Optionally add a **description** for the cable type.
- Assign **category** tags to help organize and classify cables effectively. This category selection will influence whether the cable type can be used for specific connections (see [Configuring asset connections](xref:Configuring_asset_connections)).
