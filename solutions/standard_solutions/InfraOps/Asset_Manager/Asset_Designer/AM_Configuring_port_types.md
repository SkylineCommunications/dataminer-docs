# Configuring port types

To define the type of ports available when establishing data/power connections between assets, click *Port Types* in the header bar of the Asset Designer page.

The solution comes with a predefined list of port types that you can configure and expand as needed:

You can add a port type with the *Add Port Type* button at the top, or edit an existing port type by clicking the relevant ![Hamburger icon](~/solutions/images/PB_Hamburger_icon.png) icon in the table and selecting *Edit Port Type*.

This will open a wizard with the following steps:

1. In the first window, make sure the port type name is unique, specify a description for the port type, and assign category tags to help organize and classify ports effectively:

1. Click *Next* and configure the compatible cable types for the port type:

   This compatibility between cable and port types will be relevant when adding data connections (see [Configuring asset connections](xref:Configuring_asset_connections)).

1. Click *Save*.
