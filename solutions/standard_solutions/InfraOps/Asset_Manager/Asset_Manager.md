# Asset Manager

The Asset Manager app allows you to add your assets to the system, including network, location, lifecycle, custody, and ownership details, and generic information such as serial number and firmware. Asset classes are defined that will act as templates for your managed assets, facilitating their creation and minimizing errors. Connections between assets can be defined, along with accurate positioning of assets on racks. A full hierarchical structure within a chassis (cards, subcards, modules, power supplies, and fans) can be defined and visualized in a node-edge graph.
