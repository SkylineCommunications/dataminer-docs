# Rack View

The Rack Visualization page shows a realistic view of your physical racks.<!-- TBD: in the side panel on the left, the page is called Rack Visualization, but the header at the top of the page says Rack View -->

By clicking the **Assign Asset** button for a specific slot, you can assign assets to slots directly from this overview.

With the **Reserve Slots** button, you can reserve one or more slots. To do so, you will first need to specify the slots in the adjacent text box.You can either add separate slot numbers using a semicolon as separator, or a range indicated with a hyphen, or a combination of both. Slots that have been reserved are displayed in pink.<!-- TBD: doing so asks to link or add a job; what is this job? can it be edited afterwards? How does the "Don't link" button work?-->
