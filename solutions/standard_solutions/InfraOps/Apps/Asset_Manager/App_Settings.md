# App Settings

Present on the about page, here users have access to a few settings that can be configured:

![Asset Manager App Settings Wizard](~/solutions/images/Asset_Manager_App_Settings_Wizard.png)

The first two options allow users to enable or disable the tracking of Asset and Connections changes. Then, users have the Max History Entries field, where users can define maximum number of history records. To add to the previous settings, the History TTL fields are also available for users to define for how long they want to keep their history records.

Finally, the Job Action field allows users to define if they want to be prompted with the possibility to create a job every time they make any change on the asset manager (editing assets, creating connection, etc).
