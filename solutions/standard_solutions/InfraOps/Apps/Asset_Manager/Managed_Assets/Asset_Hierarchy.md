# Asset Hierarchy

As already discussed in the Asset Class section, a user can configure a full hierarchical structure for their chassis. While in the Asset Class the user can define the number of holders available by default for the Asset, here this can be changed (adding more holders or removing them) and the Assets can be assigned to the available holders.

This can be configured using a node edge component, for that, the user needs to press the “Hierarchy” button on the asset details:

![Full Hierarchy side panel](~/solutions/images/Asset_Manager_Full_Hierarchy_Side_Panel.png)

Here the user can edit or remove existing assets from the hierarchy tree, but also can add new ones:

The option to Assign a child asset on the node edge component is only available if the chassis assets have slots available. This can be confirmed on the table view for each hierarchical level on the asset details:

![Side panel for Card assignment](~/solutions/images/Asset_Manager_Side_Panel_For_Card_Assignment.png)

Finally, on the hierarchy topic, the user can also check the node edge component along with a table with all the child assets assigned to it, by pressing “View Child Assets”:

To note that, for any change made using the node edge component, the user will also need to press “↻ Refresh hierarchy” to see the changes.
