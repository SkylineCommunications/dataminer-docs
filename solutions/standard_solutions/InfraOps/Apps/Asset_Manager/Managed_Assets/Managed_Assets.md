# Managed Assets

When the necessary asset classes have been configured in the [Asset Designer](xref:Asset_Designer), you can add assets to the system.

You can either [import the assets from CSV](#importing-assets-from-csv) or [create assets manually](#manually-adding-an-asset).

Via the context menu of an asset on the Managed Assets page, you can change the state of the asset. However, the states you can assign depend on the current state of the asset. For details, refer to [Asset lifecycle](xref:Asset_Lifecycle).

## Importing assets from CSV

1. In the header bar, click *Import/export Assets to/from CSV*.

1. In the Option box, keep *Import* selected.

1. Next to *File to import*, click *Choose file* and select the file you want to import.

1. Click *Upload*, and then click *Import*.

## Manually adding an asset

1. In the header bar, click *Create Asset*.

1. Specify a unique ID and name for the asset, and select the asset class.

1. Click *Save*.

The newly created asset will inherit the configuration from its asset class.
