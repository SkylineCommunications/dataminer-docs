# Configuring cable types

To define the type of cables available when establishing data/network connections between assets, click *Cable Types* in the header bar of the Asset Designer page.

The solution comes with a predefined list of cable types that you can configure and expand as needed:

You can add a cable type with the *Add Cable Type* button at the top, or edit an existing cable type by clicking the hamburger button for that cable type in the table and selecting *Edit Cable Type*. When you do so, make sure the cable type name is unique. You can also specify a description for the cable type and assign category tags to help organize and classify cables effectively:
