# Port Types

Here the user can define the type of ports available when establishing data/network connections between assets. Same as the Device Types and Cable Types, the solution already comes with a predefined list that the user can configure and expand:

![Port Types side panel](~/solutions/images/Asset_Manager_Port_Types_Side_Panel.png)

When creating or updating a Port Type, the user must provide a unique name. Additionally, they can specify a description for the port and assign category tags to help organize and classify ports effectively:

After configuring the previously mentioned fields, the user can now define the compatible cable for this port:

As mentioned earlier, this compatibility between Cable and Port Types will be relevant when adding Data Connections. On the Asset Class details, the user will be able to define the number of ports and their type (along with other metadata) that will be available by default when creating assets for that asset class.

This configuration is accessible on the Asset Class details, on the Ports tab, and pressing the “+Add Data Port” or ”+Add Power Port” button:

![+Add Data Port Wizard](~/solutions/images/Asset_Manager_Add_Data_Port_Wizard.png)

Besides the Port Type, the user can create multiple ports at the same time (Number of ports), define the Exposure type (Front or Back of the Rack) and the Output Type (In, Out or IO).
