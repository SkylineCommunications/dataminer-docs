# Row Viewer

The Row Viewer page provides a front overview of all the racks present in a selected row.<!-- TBD: in the side panel on the left, the page is called Row View, but the header at the top of the page says Row Viewer -->

With the filter boxes at the top, you can change which row is selected.

The **Assign Rack** button on the right provides a quick way to assign an available rack to the selected row.
