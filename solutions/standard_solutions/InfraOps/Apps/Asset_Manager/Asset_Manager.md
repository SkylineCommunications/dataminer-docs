# Asset Manager

The Asset Management app allows users to create their Assets, defining Network, Location, Lifecycle, Custody and Ownership Details and generic information such as Serial Number and FW/OS. Here the user is also able to define Asset Classes, which act as templates for their Manage assets, facilitating their creation and minimizing errors.

Connections between assets can be defined, along with accurate positioning of assets on racks. A full hierarchical structure within a chassis (card, subcards, modules, power supplies and fans) can be defined and visualized with a node edge component.
