# InfraOps

The dataminer.InfraOps solution unifies planning, monitoring, and automation in one powerful solution for media, telecom, satellite, and energy organizations. In one environment, you will be able to manage the entire lifecycle of your infrastructure, both on and off premises. From the first planning steps to real-time monitoring and continuous optimization, everything is connected.

The InfraOps solution includes the following three applications, which are ready for use out of the box:

- [Facility Manager](xref:Facility_Manager): Gives you a full picture of your infrastructure, allowing you to manage buildings, floors, rooms, etc.

- [Asset Manager](xref:Asset_Manager): Provides full visibility into your infrastructure. Track assets with all their details, and link them to jobs and locations for real-time insight.

- [Plan and Build](xref:Plan_And_Build): Keeps track of every action that needs to be taken for your assets, including installation, provisioning, upgrades, maintenance, and much more, ensuring that your planning is always based on reliable data.

It also makes use of the [Web File Manager app](xref:Web_File_Manager) in order to manage images used in the solution.
