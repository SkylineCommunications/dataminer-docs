# Web File Manager

The Web File Manager app is used to upload and manage image files. It is a prerequisite for the InfraOps solution, in order to be able to add images [for floor or room plans](xref:Facilities_Page) in the Facility Manager app, or [for asset classes](xref:Asset_Designer#configuring-an-asset-class) in the Asset Manager app.
