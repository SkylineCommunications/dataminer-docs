# Regression Test Management

The Regression Test Management Solution allows you to centrally organize, configure, and monitor regression tests for your DataMiner platform. It is designed to support continuous validation of critical functionality across elements, connectors, or services.

This solution includes a dedicated connector, visual overview, and reusable automation script that together help teams automate and track the execution of regression test scripts. Results are visualized, emailed, and stored historically for auditing and reporting purposes.

Deployed as a [Catalog package](https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/27636bb4-e3ce-4a2a-bd28-fe514a4ac5e7), the solution installs everything needed to start managing your regression tests immediately.

## Key capabilities

- **Centralized test configuration**: Group, order, and manage test scripts from a dedicated configuration table.
- **Flexible execution options**: Run tests manually via Cube, automatically at scheduled times, or programmatically through the DataMiner Scheduler.
- **Email reporting**: Automatically notify stakeholders with a summary of test results, including success rate and failure reasons.
- **Historical result tracking**: View past test runs in a dashboard-style overview with drill-down details.
- **Modular design**: Integrates seamlessly with your existing test scripts developed using Skyline's [Regression Test Template](https://github.com/SkylineCommunications/Skyline.DataMiner.GithubTemplate.RegressionTest).
