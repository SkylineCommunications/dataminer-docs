# Using the Regression Test Management Solution

Once you have configured your test groups and report settings, you can execute tests manually or automatically, track their results, and access detailed reports.

## Executing regression tests

Below you can find the different ways you can execute regression tests.

### From the Settings page

Click the *Execute Tests* button on the *Settings* page to run all configured tests immediately. This simulates the daily automated execution and sends an email report if this is enabled.

### From the Test Configuration page

On the *Test Configuration* page:

- To run a **single test**, click the *Execute* button in the corresponding row in the *Regression Tests* table.
- To run an entire **group**, click the *Execute* button next to a group in the *Groups* table. All associated tests will execute in the specified order.

### From the visual overview

On the visual overview of the *Regression Test Results* element, click the *EXECUTE* button. This will open a window where you can select specific tests or folders to run.

### From DataMiner Scheduler

1. In DataMiner Cube, open the [Scheduler](xref:scheduler) module.

1. [Create a new task](xref:Manually_adding_a_scheduled_task), using the following configuration:

   1. Set the *Recurrence* (e.g. daily at 2:00 AM).

   1. Under *Actions*, select the *RegressionTestRunner* script.

   1. Provide the configuration in the *ScriptConfiguration* field using a JSON structure like this:

      ```json
      {
        "Folders": ["Regression Testing"],
        "Scripts": ["RT_TestName"],
        "SearchSubDirectories": True,
        "ScriptsToSkip": ["RT_SKIP_THIS"],
        "FoldersToSkip": ["Regression Testing/FolderToSkip"],
        "Recipients": ["someone@example.com"]
      }
      ```

## Viewing test results

Go to the *General* page of the *Regression Test Results* element to view the summary of test executions.

- **Summary** shows the total number of tests and the overall success rate.
- **Overview** displays the list of executed tests with their result, reason, and timestamp.

## Email reports

If this is enabled on the *Settings* page, the system sends out a formatted email report after execution, with the following information:

- Success rate
- Test names
- Result (OK/Fail)
- Reason for failure or success
- Timestamp

![Email settings panel](~/solutions/images/Regression_Test_Email.png)

These reports help quickly identify failures and track regression test health over time.

> [!NOTE]
> You can adjust email recipients or disable email entirely via the *Settings* page of the element.
