# The DataMiner Planned Maintenance (PLM) tool

The DataMiner Planned Maintenance (PLM) tool facilitates the scheduling and management of one-time or recurring maintenance events for the various resources and entities within a system.

Through a unified interface, users can [define system resources](xref:PLM_tool_configuring_resources), [schedule maintenance events](xref:Adding_maintenance_event), and [observe historical maintenance records](xref:PLM_Records).

The tool's flexible nature allows the definition of resources for any parameter from any protocol within a DataMiner System. The output from the Planned Maintenance tool can then be integrated in various ways to achieve specific outcomes, such as alarm masking, ticket suppression, etc.

This solution empowers users to create, edit, and delete maintenance events directly from the protocol interface or a low-code app.
