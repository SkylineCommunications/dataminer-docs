# DataMiner IT Tools (DITT)

The DataMiner IT Tools (DITT) Solution streamlines the monitoring and diagnostic processes for connectivity within a system. DITT is designed to work seamlessly in the background, allowing you to initiate ping and traceroute (tracert) commands directly from Visual Overview. This integration provides you with real-time diagnostic capabilities embedded within your visual interface, with detailed insights into connectivity, latency, and packet loss.

By visualizing the network paths and potential points of failure directly within the system's overview, this solution allows you to quickly identify and address issues without disrupting your ongoing tasks, ensuring minimal downtime and optimal network performance. Thanks to the seamless integration in Visual Overview, you do not need to switch between different tools or interfaces for this, which can significantly improve workflow efficiency.

After [installing the DITT package](xref:Installing_DITT) and [configuring a visual overview](xref:Implementing_DITT_in_Visio), you can have DataMiner ping or trace any device. To facilitate SSH connections and remote network device management, DITT also allows you to [open PuTTY](xref:Open_Putty_with_DITT), if it is installed on the client system.
