# DOM Viewer

The DOM Viewer is a low-code application that provides unparalleled insight in and control over your DataMiner Object Model (DOM) definitions and instances, effortlessly visualizing complex DOM relationships.

With the DOM Viewer, you can explore how DOM definitions interconnect through an intuitive node-edge graph. You can also instantly access detailed information by hovering over definitions, including the module they belong to, the number of sections and fields associated with them, and more.

You can also dive deeper by opening definition tables, where you can see a list of field descriptors filtered by section. You will be able to gain comprehensive insights into field details such as type, description, whether the field is optional or mandatory, and its read-only status. With the state transition graph feature, you can also easily view the lifecycle of instances and check how they move between states.

For a broad overview, the DOM Viewerâ€™s powerful table functionality lists all field descriptors across all definitions in every module, complete with extensive filtering options. The same features apply to all DOM instances, providing you with a holistic view of your entire DataMiner System.

Unlike the [DOM Editor](xref:DOM_Editor) tool, the DOM Viewer allows you to build a model through dialog forms. While it has similarities with the [DataMiner Objects Tool](xref:DataMiner_Objects_Tool), the DOM Viewer focuses on querying instances, quickly displaying definitions and their relationships through an interactive graph and allowing you to easily drill down when necessary. It is designed to help you not just see but also understand object models through visualization.
