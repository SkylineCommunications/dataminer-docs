# Working with the DataMiner Objects Tool

To access the DataMiner Objects Tool:

1. Go to `http(s)://[DMA name]/root`.

1. Select *DataMiner Objects Tool* to start using the tool.

## The DataMiner Objects Tool user interface

The UI of the DataMiner Objects Tool app consists of the following main components:

![Low-Code App buttons](~/dataminer/images/Using_DataMiner_Objects_Tool.png)

All functionality of the tool is accessible via the *Filter All DataMiner Objects* button (1). Clicking the button launches the *DataMiner Objects Tool* interactive Automation script, which gives an overview of each supported DataMiner object type. You can then select one of the types to open a new dialog where filters can be defined.

There are three more buttons available in the app. Each button is related to a common DataMiner object type, being resources, reservation (i.e. booking) instances, and DOM instances. For each of these types, the app shows some high-level statistics for the system.

For **reservation instances** (2), the app shows the total number of reservation instances in the system along with a pie chart that groups the reservation instances by state. The button next to these stats launches the same *DataMiner Objects Tool* script, but immediately opens the dialog to filter reservation instances.

For **resources** (3), the app shows the total number of resources in the system along with a pie chart that groups the resources by resource pool. The button next to these stats launches the same *DataMiner Objects Tool* script, but immediately opens the dialog to filter resources.

For **DOM instances** (4), the app shows the total number of DOM instances in the system along with a pie chart that groups the DOM instances by module. The button next to these stats launches the same *DataMiner Objects Tool* script, but immediately opens the dialog to filter DOM instances.

## Configuring filters

To configure a filter:

![Configuring filters](~/dataminer/images/Using_DataMiner_Objects_Tool_ConfiguringFilters.png)

1. **Include or exclude filters** by selecting or clearing the checkbox next to an item property name.

1. Select the **filter type** in the dropdown boxes. Different properties allow different filter types depending on their possible values.

1. Fill in the **filter value**. Depending on the property you filter on, this can be a string, integer, GUID, or datetime.

1. If you want to **add more filters**, use the *Duplicate* button.

   There is no limit to the number of filters you can include.

1. Click the button at the bottom of the window to **execute the query** with the included filters.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All included filters will be combined with an AND operation. There is currently no way of adding OR filters.

## Fine-tuning results

Once the items have been retrieved based on the filters you have configured, you can manually fine-tune the selection:

![Fine-tuning results](~/dataminer/images/Using_DataMiner_Objects_Tool_FinetuningResults.png)

- The **number of matching items** (1) is displayed to give a quick view on how many items in the system match the filters.

- Buttons are available to **select all or unselect all items** (2).

- The **number of selected items** (3) is also displayed, so you can see how many are included in your current selection.

- In the scrollable checkbox list at the bottom (4), you can **select individual items** or clear the selection to fine-tune the result according to your preferences.

## Executing actions on selected objects

After you have manually fine-tuned the results, you can execute the following actions for the selected objects:

![Actions](~/dataminer/images/Using_DataMiner_Objects_Tool_Actions.png)

- To add a new multiline textbox to the dialog containing all selected objects serialized in JSON format, click **Show JSON** (1).

  This can for instance be used to investigate or debug issues, or to export the objects and import them in other applications.

- To delete the selected objects from the system, first select the **Confirm** checkbox (3), and then click **Delete** (2). This confirmation is required first because deleting objects can have a large impact on the system.
