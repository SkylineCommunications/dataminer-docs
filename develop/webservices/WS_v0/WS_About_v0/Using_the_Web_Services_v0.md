# Using the Web Services (v0)

> [!WARNING]
>
> - The Web Services API v0 is **obsolete**. By default, the v0 interface is disabled. If your DMS is not connected to dataminer.services, you can enable the v0 interface again by opening the file `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Webpages\API\Web.config` and adding the following extra tag under `<appSettings>`: `<add key="enableLegacyV0Interface" value="true"/>`.
> - We strongly recommend that you use HTTPS when accessing the Web Service APIs over public Internet. If you do not do so, all information – including logon credentials – will be sent over the Internet as plain, unencrypted text.

1. Load the WSDL file.

   See [Interfaces and WSDL files](xref:Interfaces_and_WSDL_filesv0).

1. Call the *Connect* method to request a connection ID.

   See [Connect](xref:Connect).

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the connection is not used for 5 minutes, the session will end. You will then need to connect again to request a new connection ID.

1. Call any of the other methods. Remember to pass along the connection ID you received in step 2.

   For a list of available methods, see [Methods (v0)](xref:WS_Methods_v0#methods-v0).

> [!NOTE]
> In order to make a web API request from an external machine using HTTP POST instead of SOAP, uncomment the following section in the file *web.config* in the folder `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Webpages\API`:<br><br> \<!-- uncomment to test webservices outside localhost:<br> \<protocols><br> \<add name="HttpGet"/><br> \<add name="HttpPost"/><br> \</protocols><br> //-->
