# GetActiveTickets

Use this method to retrieve the active tickets for this DMA, i.e. tickets that are not closed and tickets linked to an active DataMiner alarm. The tickets are retrieved in pages, in descending order.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - From DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards, use the [GetActiveTicketsV2](xref:GetActiveTicketsV2) method instead.
> - DataMiner Ticketing requires a Cassandra database as well as a specific license. From DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards, it also requires an indexing database. For more information on acquiring a Ticketing license, contact the Skyline Sales department.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> - DataMiner Ticketing is being retired. See [DataMiner functionality evolution and retirement](xref:Software_support_life_cycles) for more details. ![EOL](~/user-guide/images/EOL_Duo.png)
> - DataMiner Ticketing is not supported on systems using [Storage as a Service (STaaS)](xref:STaaS).

## Input

| Item | Format | Description |
|--|--|--|
| connection | String | The connection ID. See [ConnectApp](xref:ConnectApp). |
| pageSessionID | Long integer | The page session ID (cf. note below). |
| pageNumber | Integer | The page number (cf. note below). |
| count | Integer | The number of tickets to be retrieved. |
| filter | Array | An array of various filters that can be used to determine which tickets are retrieved. |
| filter.TicketTypeID | GUID | The GUID of the ticket type (or “domain” in the Ticketing app). |
| filter.Filters | Array of DMATicketFieldValueDisplay | See [DMATicketFieldValueDisplay](xref:DMATicketFieldValueDisplay). |
| filter.Affecting.Value | Array | Array containing the DMA ID, the ID and the name of a DataMiner object. |
| filter.Affecting.Type | String | The type of the affected DataMiner object. Possible values are: "Element", "Service", "Redundancy Group", "Alarm", or "View". |
| filter.SearchText | String | A piece of text used to filter the tickets, similar to the quick filter in the Ticketing app. |

> [!NOTE]
> As there can be a large number of tickets, this method makes use of paging, so that you do not have to download all tickets at once. To get the first page of tickets, execute the method with *PageSessionID* = 0, *PageNumber* = 0, and *Count* equaling the number of tickets you want to retrieve on one page (e.g. 50). In the response, the *PageSessionID* will be filled in, and the total number of tickets will be indicated.
>
> With this result, you can then:
>
> - Request the next page, by executing the method again, using the *PageSessionID* from the first result, but keeping the same *PageNumber* and *Count*.
> - Request for example the fifth next page, by executing the method again, while specifying *Pagenumber* = 4 and *PageSessionID* = 0. (The *Count* remains unchanged.) This will return a new *PageSessionID* that can be used to get the next pages.

## Output

| Item | Format | Description |
|--|--|--|
| GetActiveTicketsResult | Array | Array of [DMATicket](xref:DMATicket), with the page session ID and the total number of available tickets. |
