# GetHistoryTicketsV2

Use this method to retrieve the tickets created in a particular timespan. The tickets are retrieved in pages, in descending order.

From DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards, this method should be used instead of the [GetHistoryTickets](xref:GetHistoryTickets) method.

> [!NOTE]
> DataMiner Ticketing requires a Cassandra database as well as a specific license. From DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards, it also requires an indexing database. For more information on acquiring a Ticketing license, contact the Skyline Sales department.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> - DataMiner Ticketing is being retired. See [DataMiner functionality evolution and retirement](xref:Software_support_life_cycles) for more details. ![EOL](~/user-guide/images/EOL_Duo.png)
> - DataMiner Ticketing is not supported on systems using [Storage as a Service (STaaS)](xref:STaaS).

| connection | String | The connection ID. See [ConnectApp](xref:ConnectApp). |
| utcStartTime | Long integer | The start time of the timespan for which tickets should be retrieved, in UTC format (milliseconds since midnight January 1, 1970 GMT). |
| utcEndTime | Long integer | The end time of the timespan for which tickets should be retrieved, in UTC format (milliseconds since midnight January 1, 1970 GMT). |
| pageNumber | Integer | The page number (cf. note below). |
| count | Integer | The number of tickets to be retrieved. |
| filter | Array | An array of various filters that can be used to determine which tickets are retrieved. |
| filter.TicketTypeID | GUID | The GUID of the ticket type (or “domain” in the Ticketing app). |
| filter.Filters | Array of DMATicketFieldValueDisplay | The display name, name and value of a field that is used to filter the retrieved tickets. |
| filter.Affecting.Value | Array | Array containing the DMA ID, ID and name of a DataMiner object. |
| filter.Affecting.Type | String | The type of the affected DataMiner object. |

## Output

| Item | Format | Description |
|--|--|--|
| GetHistoryTicketsResult | Array | Array of [DMATicket](xref:DMATicket), with an additional *HasNextPage* field indicating if another page of tickets is available. |

> [!NOTE]
> As there can be a large number of tickets, this method makes use of paging, so that you do not have to download all tickets at once. To get the first page of tickets, execute the method with *PageNumber* = 0, and *Count* equaling the number of tickets you want to retrieve on one page (e.g. 50). In the response, the *HasNextPage* indicates if there is another page after the current page.
