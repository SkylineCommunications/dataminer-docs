# General

- Meaningful names should be used, denoting the semantics of the identifier.

- Readability should be favored over brevity.

- Use of underscores, hyphens and other non-alphanumeric characters should be avoided.

- Use of abbreviations or contractions as part of variable names should be avoided (e.g., use "counter" instead of "cntr").

- Only acronyms and initialisms that are generally accepted in the field of computing, broadcasting, etc. may be used.
