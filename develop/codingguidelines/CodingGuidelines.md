# DataMiner Protocol Development Guidelines

The guidelines specified in this section are designed to uphold the level of quality of DMS protocols by improving readability, maintainability, and performance.

By adhering to these guidelines, we can ensure that protocols have a consistent look, and thereby increase maintainability and readability. The guidelines also increase reusability, stability and performance.

When a new protocol version is created, you must verify every item in the protocol development checklist and specify "OK", "Fail" or "NA" every time.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 (see <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>).
