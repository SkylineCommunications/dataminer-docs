# Buttons

- The width of a button must be explicitly defined in the protocol. A minimum width of 110 is advised. Only use a larger value when necessary. However, keep the width of buttons as uniform as possible (e.g., in case there are two buttons and for one button a width of 120 is required, it is better to also set the width of the other button to 120).
