# Acronyms and initialisms

Acronyms and initialisms must always be written with capital letters according to the defining standards or specifications. Acronyms and initialisms are types of abbreviations that consist of the first letters of other words and are used as a word in themselves (The difference between acronyms and initialisms is that acronyms can be pronounced as a word, whereas initialisms are pronounced as the separate letters. For example, BIOS and CORBA are acronyms, IP and DVB-2 are initialisms). In case the web interface of a device displays such abbreviations, verify their meaning and correct capitalization.

For example, the following table gives an overview of some frequently occurring acronyms and initialisms for transport streams:
