# Requirements

- **DataMiner requirements**: The Class Library Monitors require DataMiner version 9.6.4 or higher to function correctly.
- **DIS requirements**: Because of the higher DataMiner version, the class library is present in a different branch. Because of changes in existing interfaces, this feature is also classed as a major change; however, note that unless you have implemented custom classes against the CLP interfaces, there will be no impact.
