# Change page name

Changing the name of a page is considered a major change and as such a major change is required in the version numbering.

## Impact

A page name can be used in Visio. A shape can be linked to an alarm state and it can be used to display the entire page in a dashboard.

Visio and Dashboards will require configuration changes.

## Actions to be taken

Changes to page name will be approved in case:

- The current page name is wrong (for example the name of the page does not reflect the type of parameters that are presented)

All other page name changes will generally be rejected.
