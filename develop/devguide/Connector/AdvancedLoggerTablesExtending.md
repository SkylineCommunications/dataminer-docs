# Extending logger tables

It is possible to make changes to the logger table structure:<!-- RN 14383 -->

- Add columns
- Broaden a columnâ€™s data type (not supported in Cassandra): e.g. change the data type of a column from VARCHAR(10) to VARCHAR(20)

Deleting columns or narrowing the data type of a column (e.g. from VARCHAR(20) to VARCHAR(10)) is not supported. Renaming columns is also not supported.
