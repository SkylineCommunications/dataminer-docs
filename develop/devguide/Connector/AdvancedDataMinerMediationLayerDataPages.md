# Data pages

The page order, the default page, and the option *DisplayWideColmunPages* are retrieved from the mediation protocol instead of the protocol assigned to the element.<!-- RN 19166 -->

**Webpages** of the device protocol are not added by default. To add such a page, define it in the mediation protocol. **Only the name** of the webpage needs to be defined (not the # + arguments). The arguments containing the URL data will be retrieved from the protocol assigned to the element.
