# Triggers

Triggers are another important concept in protocols. A trigger defines what happens when it is activated, and how it is activated (e.g. on a parameter value change). Defining when a trigger is activated is optional, as a trigger can also be forced to execute, e.g. from a Quick Action (using the CheckTrigger method of the SLProtocol interface), by another trigger, or because it is part of a group being executed.

For an overview of what can activate a trigger, see [Protocol.Triggers.Trigger.Time](xref:Protocol.Triggers.Trigger.Time).

When activated, a trigger can:

- Either execute one (or multiple) action(s). This is the most common scenario.
- Or trigger another (or multiple) trigger(s).
