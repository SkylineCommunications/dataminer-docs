# stuffing

This action can be executed on commands and responses.

Sometimes, in the data block of a command/response, it is not allowed to use certain symbols because they are being used as control bytes in that same command/response. In that case, if you do want to use one of those symbols, it must be preceded by a redundant character to indicate that it should not be processed as a control byte but as data. This adding of redundant characters is also known as stuffing.

## On command

This action performs stuffing on the specified command(s).

## Examples

On command example

In the following example, an extra 0x10 character will be added in front of every 0x10 character, unless that 0x10 character is followed by 0x03 or 0x02. This means that, for example, 10023030301030301003 will become 1002303030101030301003:

```xml
<Action id="1">
   <On id="1">command</On>
   <Type value="0x10" allowed="0x030x02">stuffing</Type>
</Action>
```

On response example:

```xml
<Action id="5">
   <Name>Remove Stuffing</Name>
   <On>response</On>
   <Type value="0x10" startoffset="2" endoffset="2">stuffing</Type>
</Action>
```
