# SSL/TLS encryption

Elements that request data from a device via a serial port of type TCP/IP support SSL/TLS encryption. This can be configured when creating or editing an element.<!-- RN 23462 -->

From DataMiner 10.5.12/10.6.0 onwards<!-- RN 43678 -->, DataMiner only supports TLS 1.2 and 1.3 for serial communication. In earlier DataMiner versions, all TLS versions up to TLS 1.3 are supported (i.e. all TLS versions supported by OpenSSL 1.1.1). DataMiner will negotiate the highest supported TLS version with the client. For example, if the client supports TLS up to version 1.2, DataMiner will use version 1.2.

To enhance secure connector communication, SSL/TLS certificates are validated by default for all HTTP elements created after upgrading to DataMiner 10.4.12/10.5.0<!--RN 40877-->. You can disable this default setting or enable it for elements created before a 10.4.12/10.5.0 upgrade in the HTTP(S) connection settings while creating or editing an element in DataMiner Cube.
