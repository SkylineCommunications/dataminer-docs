# Logic

A protocol defines different components such as parameters, groups, triggers, and actions.

These are the most frequently used components in a protocol:

- <xref:LogicParameters>
- <xref:LogicGroups>
- <xref:LogicTimers>
- <xref:LogicTriggers>
- <xref:LogicActions>
- <xref:LogicQActions>
- <xref:LogicConditions>

> [!NOTE]
> A component always has an ID. This ID must be unique for all components of a given type. Some restrictions apply to the possible ID values that can be used (See <xref:ReservedIDs>). Additionally, a component may have a name and a description, which also must be unique for a given type.
