# Code pages

A code page is used to convert a text character to a unique number, called a code point, and vice versa. It is this number that is kept in memory and that is saved to elementdata in the database.

## Windows code page

When the unicode [option](xref:Protocol.Type-options) is not explicitly defined in a connector, string-type parameters default to using the **system-default ANSI code page** configured on the server OS hosting DataMiner, e.g. Windows-1252 (Latin 1). As the terminology "system-default ANSI code page" could be confused with the formal ANSI standard, it will be further referred to as the "Windows code page". Windows-1252 (Latin 1) contains 256 characters, being assigned to 256 numbers, and fitting into a single byte (0x00 - 0xFF).

String values that enter, e.g. through protocol.SetParameter in a QAction, are always in UTF-16 encoding format. Before being stored in the parameter, the incoming (Unicode) character is looked up in the Windows code page to know what the code point is and store this number. If a character present in the Unicode code page cannot be represented in the Windows code page (e.g. an emoji), it is replaced with a default character. For Windows-1252 (Latin 1), this defaults to the question mark "?".

Because the Windows code page depends on the OS configuration, parameter values may differ across DMAs with different settings. For example:

- If the OS uses Windows-1252 (Latin 1) and a Unicode character "Â" (0x00C2 UTF-16 encoding) is set on a parameter, this character is known in Windows-1252 and translates into byte 0xC2, which is the correct expected character.
- If the Windows code page is changed to Windows-1251 (Cyrillic), the previously stored byte 0xC2 will now be loaded from the database and translated with this Windows code page as the Cyrillic capital letter "В" (0x0412 UTF-16 encoding), resulting in a different (unexpected) character being displayed by the parameter.
- Setting again the same character "Â" under Windows-1251 (Cyrillic) on the parameter will fail to map correctly, causing it to be saved and displayed as the default "?" character.

Another example is the "€" character, which is supported by multiple Windows code pages but maps to different byte values:

- Under Windows-1252 (Latin 1), it maps to byte 0x80.
- Under Windows-1251 (Cyrillic), it maps to byte 0x88.

The different mapping affects how the inserted character is stored and sent in a serial command towards a device.

Because of these inconsistencies, we recommend only using characters inside of the ASCII subset range (0x00-0x7F). Characters beyond ASCII range (0x80-0xFF) may behave unpredictably depending on the Windows code page. Elements should use Unicode to avoid such issues.

Improvements introduced in DataMiner 10.6.1 (RN 43929), help make transitions between the Windows code page and Unicode smoother for elements with stored values:

- Table primary key values are always stored in Unicode. This ensures consistent row loading, regardless of the code page.
- The Unicode characters are also saved in the database when a string value enters on a saved string-type parameter, e.g. via a protocol.SetParameter call in a QAction, or a write parameter with the `setter="true"` attribute. This enables an element that switches to a Unicode version to load and display the text as it was originally set on the parameter.

> [!NOTE]

> - Saving Unicode data of elements that use the Windows code page is not supported with a local MySQL database.
> - Exporting an element that uses the Windows code page to a DELT package will not include the Unicode data.

## Unicode

Unicode itself is also a code page like the Windows code pages, but contains all possible characters, including emojis.

### Encoding

How the unique code point values are stored is defined by the encoding. There is for example UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 encoding. UTF-8 is typically used for web pages, while UTF-16 is more used in programming languages on Windows or Java. The different kinds of encoding are capable of storing all characters of the Unicode code page, but store the code points in a different way.

UTF-8 only uses one byte to store the range 0x00-0x7F, which contains the standard ASCII characters. When the most significant bit is one, more bytes follow to represent the character. UTF-16 uses two or more bytes to store a code point. The range of the standard ASCII characters will be 0x0000 - 0x007F. When the string content only consists of ASCII characters, UTF-8 will use half the number of bytes needed compared to UTF-16 (1 byte per character versus 2 bytes).

There are also a number of commonly used characters that are stored in a region called Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). UTF-8 takes 3 bytes to store such character, while UTF-16 takes 2 bytes.

When the string content only consists of characters of the BMP region, UTF-8 encoding uses 1.5 times more memory compared to UTF-16 (3 bytes per character versus 2). An example is the "€" character. This one takes two bytes in UTF-16 encoding (0x20AC), and three bytes in UTF-8 encoding (0xE282AC). UTF-32 always uses a fixed four bytes per code point, resulting in 0x000020AC for the "€" character. UTF-32 encoding takes most memory but performs faster as there is a one-to-one mapping between the code point number and the stored byte value.

If a connector receives raw bytes without knowing the used code page and encoding when communicating with a device, the connector will not be able to translate this into the correct characters.

For example, 0xE282AC is:

- one character in UTF-8: "€"
- two characters in UTF-16: one PUA character (may render as a black box), followed by one "not sign" character.
- three characters in Windows-1252: "â´", followed by one "not sign" character.

### Composed characters

Some Latin characters could be represented by two code points. This could be considered similar to typing with a French AZERTY keyboard where a character "é" can be typed either by pressing the "é" key directly (one code point), or by first pressing the accent key "´" (one code point) and then pressing the "e" key (second code point).

The same principle applies with Unicode: either there is one code point (= precomposed character), or there are two code points (= decomposed character): one code point for the base character "e" and one code point for the non-spacing character "´".

When a device sends data as a decomposed character, this could be wrongly displayed as two separate characters when precomposed characters are assumed to be used, displaying "e´" instead of "é".

## Unicode in connectors

When the unicode [option](xref:Protocol.Type-options) is explicitly defined in a connector, string-type parameters data is stored with UTF-16 encoding with precomposed characters.

Special cases are when a parameter has [Interprete.RawType](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.RawType) set to `numeric text` in combination with a specific [Interprete.Type](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Type):

- Type `double` is always handled as ASCII encoding with one byte per character, regardless of the Unicode setting.
- Type `string` is handled as UTF-16 encoding when the Unicode option is defined.

### Fixed parameters

Avoid combining [Interprete.Value](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Value) with [Interprete.Length](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Length) for fixed parameters.

If [Interprete.Length](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Length) is specified, the parameter value must adhere to the specified length:

- The parameter value is prefixed with spaces if the value specified in [Interprete.Value](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Value) is smaller than the specified length.
- If the value specified in [Interprete.Value](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Value) is larger than the specified length, the specified value is ignored and the parameter value is filled with spaces up to the specified length. This could lead to unexpected results in Unicode when an odd Interprete.Length value is defined, as the UTF-16 encoding of a space character is two bytes.

The parameter value will be different with Unicode or Windows code page, as the length is defined in bytes. For example:

- Interprete Value "Hello1" with Interprete Length 12:

  - Windows code page: Parameter value "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello1" (6 prefix spaces + 6 characters)
  - Unicode: Parameter value "Hello1" (two bytes per character, 12 bytes total, no prefix spaces needed)

- Interprete Value "Hello1" with Interprete Length 6

  - Windows code page: Parameter value "Hello1" (6 characters)
  - Unicode: Parameter value "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" (two bytes per character, would require 12 bytes in total, replaced with default three prefix spaces)

To simplify connector development, for a fixed string-type parameter only define [Interprete.Value](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Value) without [Interprete.Length](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Length). This ensures consistent loading of the specified value in both Windows code page and Unicode.

If a fixed series of byte values should remain the same in Windows code page and Unicode (e.g. to send a serial command or match a serial response), use [Interprete.Value](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Value) in "0x" format (e.g. 0x02). This preserves the byte values without converting them to Windows code page or Unicode.

### Serial commands

The byte value sent to a device depends on the Interprete definition of the parameter. Unicode applies only to parameters that have [Interprete.Type](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Type) `string` in combination with an [Interprete.RawType](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.RawType) `other`, or something else related to text. Unicode string parameters are sent as UTF-16 encoding in little endian format. For example, the "€" character 0x20AC is sent as AC20 with the least significant byte first.

When the `ascii="true"` option is specified on a command, all string-type parameters of that command will be sent as Windows code page byte values. Numeric parameters will not be converted, nor will any parameters with [Interprete.Value](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Value) defined with the hardcoded "0x" format.

Specifying a parameter ID in the `ascii` attribute of a command forces the conversion of the value from Unicode to Windows code page, regardless of the Interprete definition.

### Serial responses

Response data enters as raw bytes and is directly inserted in parameters.

Parameters with [Interprete.Type](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Type) `double` and [Interprete.RawType](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.RawType) `numeric text` are decoded as ASCII with one byte per character. For example, 0x31 will be displayed as "1".

The interpretation of the raw bytes of a parameter back to string text depends on the Unicode option:

- When Unicode is active, these raw bytes are considered to represent UTF-16 encoded characters and are interpreted like this, which could lead to unexpected results when the device is not sending in UTF-16 encoded format.
- When Windows code page is active, these raw bytes are considered to represent the current Windows code page, which could also lead to unexpected results when the device is sending in a different format.

As there is no `ascii` attribute on a response when Unicode is active, correctly interpreting the raw bytes as ASCII or Windows code page string text requires manual handling.

Read the raw bytes with a QAction and use the applicable encoding (e.g. Encoding.ASCII.GetString) to convert the bytes into a string. Then set that string on a displayed parameter.

### Trap binding OctetString

A parameter that is used to receive traps with `setBindings="allBindingInfo"` results in a received value that needs to be processed with a QAction. In case of a binding of type OctetString, the returned value will either be a readable string when all characters are printable, or a string in HEX format. In case a readable string is returned, but the raw bytes are needed, it will need to be converted back from text to bytes. For example, when a binding contains a MAC address and the OctetString has byte values 0x313233343536, the returned value in the QAction will be "123456".

Converting the readable string value back to a string in HEX format can be done as illustrated in the code example below. Every byte value of the OctetString is directly inserted into one Unicode character, without performing any mapping with the used code page. Unicode.GetBytes needs to be used to get the exact byte value of the OctetString back, even when the connector is not using the Unicode option. As only one byte is inserted per Unicode character, only the bytes on the even positions are needed back from the decoded Unicode bytes.

Do not use a different encoding like System.Text.Encoding.Default.GetBytes. At first sight, this will look correct when the server uses Windows-1252 and the content is limited to characters in the ASCII range. The same number of bytes are returned as in the OctetString. However, it could be that the inserted byte was e.g. 0x8C, pushed into Unicode UTF-16 as 0x008C, which is a control character in Unicode. This control character does not exist in Windows-1252, defaulting back to the question mark "?" = 0x3F. Instead of the inserted byte 0x8C, the returned byte will be 0x3F.

```csharp
// Expected size of the MAC address is 6 bytes in this example.
// When the returned value has a length of 12, e.g. '313233343536', then this is in HEX format and 'mac' can be used as is.
// When the returned value has a length of 6, e.g. '123456', then this is readable text and it needs to be converted back to the HEX format.
if (mac.Length == 6)
{
    byte[] rawBytes = System.Text.Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(mac); // Converting the Unicode text back to bytes. Size of rawBytes will be zero.
    System.Text.StringBuilder sb = new System.Text.StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 0; i < rawBytes.Length; i+=2 /*Only take byte values on even positions into account*/)
    {
        sb.AppendFormat("{0:x2}", rawBytes[i]); // Format byte as HEX in lower case.
    }

    mac = sb.ToString();
}
```

## Converting an existing connector into Unicode

If you are using DataMiner 10.6.1 or higher, when you implement Unicode in an existing connector that was using Windows code page, take the following steps into account:

1. First define the unicode [option](xref:Protocol.Type-options).

1. When there are fixed-length parameters with [Interprete.Value](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Value) and [Interprete.Length](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Length) defined, remove the [Interprete.Length](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Interprete.Length), but do keep in mind that there might be prefixed spaces in case the value in Interprete.Length is larger than that in Interprete.Value. (See [Fixed parameters](#fixed-parameters).)

1. Adapt elements with a serial connection: The `ascii` attribute needs to be added to the commands to let the command send the same value as before. String type parameters can no longer be displayed directly: define new hidden parameters to be used in the response. A QAction should read out the raw bytes of the hidden string parameter in the response with a NotifyProtocol NT_GET_DATA, and then convert these bytes back into a string, e.g. with Encoding.ASCII.GetString, and set that string value to the displayed parameter that was originally in the response of the previous connector version. (See [Serial responses](#serial-responses).)

> [!NOTE]
> DataMiner 10.6.1 (RN 43929) is required for this. In earlier DataMiner versions, the behavior is different, and an upgrade to 10.6.1 or higher will introduce breaking changes to this functionality. Fixed parameters with a value as text in combination with Unicode is not supported in earlier versions. If you are using an earlier DataMiner version, specify the value in the 0x format. In addition, in earlier versions `ascii="true"` on a command is applied to all parameters in the command, even on numeric text parameters. Explicitly specify the parameter IDs in the `ascii` attribute to make it compatible with earlier DataMiner versions.
