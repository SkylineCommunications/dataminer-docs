# Tree control

DataMiner Cube supports representing data in a hierarchical way by means of a tree control. A typical example of where a tree control can be used is a DVB probe. The probe typically consists of a number of inputs and each input consists of a number of transport streams. A transport stream then defines a number of services and each service consists of a number of elementary streams.

> - An example protocol "SLC SDF Treecontrol" is available in the Protocol Development Guide Companion Files.
> - For a tree control to function correctly, make sure the primary/foreign keys do not contain reserved characters used in the dynamic table filter syntax, as mentioned in Primary keys and Foreign keys.
