# View impact configuration

EPM provides the ability to link EPM objects to views using the [viewImpact](xref:ColumnOptionOptionsOverview#viewimpact) table column option.

With this option, a new alarm icon is shown next to the view in the Surveyor. In addition to the bar that shows the highest alarm severity within that view, a circle will show the alarm severity of the EPM entity.

For example, in the screenshot below, North America, USA, and USA West are EPM entities linked to a view using this option.
