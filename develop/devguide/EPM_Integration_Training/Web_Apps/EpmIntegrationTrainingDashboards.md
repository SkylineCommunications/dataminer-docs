# EPM and Dashboards

Dashboards created with the [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D) are often used in the EPM Solution.

These frequently make use of EPM pickers. For more details on using EPM pickers, see [EPM picker](xref:DashboardEPMPicker).

If you have deployed the [EPM Integration Training](xref:EpmIntegrationTrainingAbout) package, the **Device Overview** and **Device Grid Overview** dashboard will be available. These dashboards leverage an EPM picker and serve as an excellent reference model for designing dashboards across various EPM fields.
