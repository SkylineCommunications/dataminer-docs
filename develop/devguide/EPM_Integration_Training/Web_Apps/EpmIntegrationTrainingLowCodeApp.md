# EPM and Low-Code Apps

The [DataMiner Low-Code Apps](xref:Application_framework) module is similar to the Dashboards app, but provides a lot more functionality, so that it can be used to create complete custom applications that interact with data from the EPM setup.

If you have deployed the [EPM Integration Training](xref:EpmIntegrationTrainingAbout) package, the **EPM Integration Training** low-code app will be available. This app is designed to facilitate a hands-on understanding of EPM systems. It consists of the following pages:

- **Customer**: This page uses an EPM picker to filter on customer information within the EPM customer table. This approach simplifies the process of accessing and analyzing customer data by applying targeted filters to streamline data searches.

- **Entities Overview**: This page illustrates how foreign keys are used to filter EPM tables. It showcases how to streamline the viewing and management of interconnected data within the EPM ecosystem.
