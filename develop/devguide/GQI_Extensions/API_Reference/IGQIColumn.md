# IGQIColumn interface

## Definition

- Namespace: `Skyline.DataMiner.Analytics.GenericInterface`
- Assembly: `SLAnalyticsTypes.dll`

Provides a common interface for all GQI column classes. It can be used in situations where both newly-defined columns as well as existing columns are accepted.

```csharp
public interface IGQIColumn : IEquatable<IGQIColumn>
```

## Derived types

- [GQIColumn](xref:GQI_GQIColumn)
- GQIEditableColumn
- Other core GQI framework objects that should not be referenced explicitly.

## Methods

### bool Equals(IGQIColumn)

Defines whether an implementation of IGQIColumn refers to the same column as another.

Available from DataMiner 10.4.5/10.5.0 onwards.<!-- RN 39136 -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Column objects generated by the extension itself do not contain a unique reference to a query column and as such have no reliable way to determine equality. Therefore, this equality method should **only be used to compare implementations coming from the core GQI framework itself**.

#### Parameters

- [IGQIColumn](xref:GQI_IGQIColumn) `other`: The other column to check equality against.

#### Returns

`true` when the column to compare against refers to the same query column; otherwise `false`.
