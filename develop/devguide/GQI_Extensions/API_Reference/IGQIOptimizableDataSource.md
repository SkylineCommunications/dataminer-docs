# IGQIOptimizableDataSource interface

Available from DataMiner 10.3.3/10.4.0 onwards<!-- RN 35389 -->.

> [!NOTE]
> This interface is only used by the GQI framework in the lifecycle for ad hoc data sources from DataMiner 10.5.0 [CU2]/10.5.5 onwards when using the [GQI DxM](xref:GQI_DxM)<!-- RN42528 -->.

## Definition

- Namespace: `Skyline.DataMiner.Analytics.GenericInterface`
- Assembly: `SLAnalyticsTypes.dll`

The *IGQIOptimizableDataSource* interface can be used to optimize an ad hoc data source based on operators added to a query.

> [!TIP]
> You can implement this interface to forward sort operations to an underlying database to improve performance.

## Methods

### IGQIQueryNode Optimize(IGQIDataSourceNode currentNode, IGQICoreOperator nextOperator)

Called when an optimizable operator is appended directly to the ad hoc data source. Given the current query node that represents the ad hoc data source and the next operator, it should return the resulting query node.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about when this method is called within an [ad hoc data source](xref:Ad_hoc_Life_cycle#optimize).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The `Optimize` method may not be called if there are no supported subsequent operators.
> - The `Optimize` method will be called each time the next operator changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the `Optimize` method only triggers for filter operators (`IGQIFilterOperator`) and (from DataMiner 10.4.0/10.4.1 onwards<!-- RN 37806 -->) sort operators (`IGQISortOperator`).

#### Parameters

- [IGQIDataSourceNode](xref:GQI_IGQIDataSourceNode) `currentNode`: A reference to the current node.

- [IGQICoreOperator](xref:GQI_IGQICoreOperator) `nextOperator`: A reference to the next operator.

- The [IGQIOptimizableOperator](xref:GQI_IGQIOptimizableOperator) to optimize custom operators.
