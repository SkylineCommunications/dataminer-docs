# Lifecycle of ad hoc data sources

Whenever an ad hoc data source is used, an instance of the associated C# class is created, and GQI will call the relevant lifecycle methods that define its behavior.

The simplified diagram below shows in what order each GQI lifecycle method is called.

> [!NOTE]
> In practice, the lifecycle methods that will be called depend on various conditions. Refer to the [detailed lifecycle overview](#detailed-lifecycle-overview) for a complete overview.

## When is an ad hoc data source instance created?

A new ad hoc data source instance is created **every time** one of the following requests occur:

- A **capability request**, used to determine the query arguments used in the query builder.
- A **columns request**, used to determine which columns are available without fetching any data.
- A **new session request**, used to retrieve the actual data from an ad hoc data source

The type of request also determines which lifecycle methods are used.

## Detailed lifecycle overview

The following lifecycle methods exist for ad hoc data sources:

| Method | Interface | Required | Availability |
|--|--|--|--|
| [OnInit](#oninit) | [IGQIOnInit](xref:GQI_IGQIOnInit) | No | Always |
| [GetInputArguments](#getinputarguments) | [IGQIInputArguments](xref:GQI_IGQIInputArguments) | No | Always |
| [OnArgumentsProcessed](#onargumentsprocessed) | [IGQIInputArguments](xref:GQI_IGQIInputArguments) | No | Always |
| [GetColumns](#getcolumns) | [IGQIDataSource](xref:GQI_IGQIDataSource) | Yes | Always |
| [Optimize](#optimize) | [IGQIOptimizableDataSource](xref:GQI_IGQIOptimizableDataSource) | No | From DataMiner 10.5.0 [CU2]/10.5.5 onwards when using the [GQI DxM](xref:GQI_DxM)<!-- RN42528 --> |
| [OnPrepareFetch](#onpreparefetch) | [IGQIOnPrepareFetch](xref:GQI_IGQIOnPrepareFetch) | No | Always |
| [OnStartUpdates](#onstartupdates) | [IGQIUpdateable](xref:GQI_IGQIUpdateable) | No | From DataMiner 10.4.4/10.5.0 onwards<!-- RN 38643 --> |
| [GetNextPage](#getnextpage) | [IGQIDataSource](xref:GQI_IGQIDataSource) | Yes | Always |
| [OnStopUpdates](#onstopupdates) | [IGQIUpdateable](xref:GQI_IGQIUpdateable) | No | From DataMiner 10.4.4/10.5.0 onwards<!-- RN 38643 --> |
| [OnDestroy](#ondestroy) | [IGQIOnDestroy](xref:GQI_IGQIOnDestroy) | No | Always |

The lifecycle methods that are called on an ad hoc data source instance depend on the following conditions:

- The [interfaces](xref:Ad_hoc_Building_blocks) that are implemented by the associated C# class.
- The type of GQI request for which the instance was [created](#when-is-an-ad-hoc-data-source-instance-created).
- The operators used in the query.
- The query options provided by the client (e.g. whether updates are enabled).
- The result of previous lifecycle methods.

The following diagram shows a complete overview of all possible lifecycle paths.

![Ad hoc data source lifecycle](~/dataminer/images/GQI_AdHocDataSourceLifeCycle2.png)

### OnInit

Building block interface: [IGQIOnInit](xref:GQI_IGQIOnInit)

If implemented, `OnInit` is always the first lifecycle method. It can provide references to dependencies like a logger or an SLNet connection, and it can be used to initialize resources that should be available during the lifetime of the ad hoc data source instance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Resources that are initialized here should be cleaned up in the final [OnDestroy](#ondestroy) lifecycle method.

> [!NOTE]
> When resources are only required for specific requests, the initialization should be done in later lifecycle methods to avoid unnecessary resource allocations:
>
> - For resources that are only needed to support real-time updates, use the [OnStartUpdates](#onstartupdates) lifecycle method.
> - For resources that are only needed to fetch data, use the [OnPrepareFetch](#onpreparefetch) lifecycle method.
> - For resources that are only needed to determine columns, use the [GetColumns](#getcolumns) lifecycle method.

### GetInputArguments

Building block interface: [IGQIInputArguments](xref:GQI_IGQIInputArguments)

If implemented, the `GetInputArguments` method defines the arguments that can be used to configure the ad hoc data source in a query.

Later, the arguments defined here will determine which argument values are available in the [OnArgumentsProcessed](#onargumentsprocessed) lifecycle method.

### OnArgumentsProcessed

Building block interface: [IGQIInputArguments](xref:GQI_IGQIInputArguments)

If implemented, the `OnArgumentsProcessed` method gives access to the values of the arguments defined in the [GetInputArguments](#getinputarguments) lifecycle method that were specified in the query.

### GetColumns

Building block interface: [IGQIDataSource](xref:GQI_IGQIDataSource)

The `GetColumns` lifecycle method defines the name and type of the columns that are available in the ad hoc data source.

### Optimize

Building block interface: [IGQIOptimizableDataSource](xref:GQI_IGQIOptimizableDataSource)

If implemented, the `Optimize` lifecycle method allows the ad hoc data source to interpret operators that are applied immediately after the data source and potentially adjust its behavior to improve performance of data retrieval.

This lifecycle method can be called multiple times for the same instance when the ad hoc data source optimizes the previously applied operator away.

### OnPrepareFetch

Building block interface: [IGQIOnPrepareFetch](xref:GQI_IGQIOnPrepareFetch)

If implemented, the `OnPrepareFetch` lifecycle method allows the ad hoc data source instance to initialize resources that are only needed when fetching data.

If resources are initialized in this method, they should be cleaned up in the final [OnDestroy](#ondestroy) lifecycle method.

### OnStartUpdates

Building block interface: [IGQIUpdateable](xref:GQI_IGQIUpdateable)

If implemented, the `OnStartUpdates` lifecycle method is only called when updates are enabled in the query options. It allows the ad hoc data source instance to initialize any resources that are required to support real-time updates such as subscriptions and event handlers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Resources that are initialized here should be cleaned up in the [OnStopUpdates](#onstopupdates) lifecycle method.

### GetNextPage

Building block interface: [IGQIDataSource](xref:GQI_IGQIDataSource)

The `GetNextPage` lifecycle method defines the actual data for the ad hoc data source instance. It will be called at least once and can subsequently be called again multiple times as long as the previous GetNextPage call indicates that more pages are available.

### OnStopUpdates

Building block interface: [IGQIUpdateable](xref:GQI_IGQIUpdateable)

If implemented, the `OnStopUpdates` lifecycle method is only called when updates were enabled in the query options. It allows the ad hoc data source instance to clean up any resources that were initialized in the [OnStartUpdates](#onstartupdates) lifecycle method to support real-time updates.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `OnStopUpdates` lifecycle method will **not** be called when the [OnStartUpdates](#onstartupdates) lifecycle method failed.

### OnDestroy

Building block interface: [IGQIOnDestroy](xref:GQI_IGQIOnDestroy)

If implemented, `OnDestroy` is always the last lifecycle method. It allows you to clean up any resources that were used during the lifetime of the ad hoc data source instance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `OnDestroy` lifecycle method will **not** be called when the [OnInit](#oninit) lifecycle method failed.
