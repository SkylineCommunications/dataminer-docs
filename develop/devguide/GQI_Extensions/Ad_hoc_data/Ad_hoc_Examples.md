# Examples

Before you start building an ad hoc data source of your own, it can be useful to take a look at some examples. This is why our documentation includes several concrete use cases that will illustrate how you can configure a specific ad hoc data source.

Would you like to add more examples? [Create a pull request](xref:CTB_Creating_PR) on GitHub to include your examples in our documentation. Or if you have suggestions for additional examples, but you would prefer not to add them yourself, please get in touch with your Skyline contact person or [create a GitHub issue](xref:CTB_Reporting_Issue) where you elaborate the examples you would like to see.
