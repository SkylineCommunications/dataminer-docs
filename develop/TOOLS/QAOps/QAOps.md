## What Is QAOps

QAOps, (Quality Assurance and Operations) is a Regression Test Orchestration Platform built upon DataMiner. It allows Users and Pipelines to run DataMiner Test Packages on DaaS setups, visualizing and storing the results.

Those results can be used to form quality gates, blocking releases automatically within automation pipelines.

It's main goal is to automatically provide a more robust product within a DataMiner environment and improve interoppability of different modules and solutions through the sharing and combining of Test Packages for different Solution and DataMiner features.

## Why use QAOps

Especially with the ever increasing rise in collaborative development and community-driven pull requests through LLM assistance, automated quality assurance becomes and ever increasing critical part of any ecosystem.

Through QAOps, you could make your own Test Package and even request that new DataMiner releases are blocked if your particular Test Package would indicate something breaking. Or a more common scenario is that you can test changes made to your solution, in a Repeatable, Automated and consistent way through the use of the QAOps Platform.

QAOps allows for provisioning of Clean DataMiner (DaaS) servers, this ensures your tests always start from a clean setup.
