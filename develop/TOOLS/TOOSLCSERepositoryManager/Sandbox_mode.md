# Sandbox mode

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section includes information that is only applicable to Skyline employees.

The SLC SE Repo Manager tool supports a "Sandbox" mode that allows you to experiment with the different operations.

To enable or disable Sandbox mode, go to *Tools* > *Options* and select or clear the check box *Sandbox Mode*.

When Sandbox mode is activated, the window has a pink border. In Sandbox mode, only one vendor is shown in the tree control: *SLCSandbox*.
