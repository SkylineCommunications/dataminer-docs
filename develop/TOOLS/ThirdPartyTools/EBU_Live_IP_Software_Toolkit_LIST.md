# EBU live IP software toolkit (LIST)

EBU LIST is a freely available suite of software tools that can be used to check the state of IP-based networks and their high-bitrate media traffic. This can for instance be useful to measure the impact of new equipment connected to the network, or to pinpoint issues in an IP-based live production facility.
