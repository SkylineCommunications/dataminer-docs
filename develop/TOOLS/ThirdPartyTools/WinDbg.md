## SOSEX debugger extension commands

The Son of Strike Extension (SOSEX), created by Steve Johnson, provides additional commands and features, such as deadlock detection and improved diagnostics for .NET applications.

This extension can be downloaded [here (32 bit)](http://www.stevestechspot.com/downloads/sosex_32.zip) or [here (64 bit)](http://www.stevestechspot.com/downloads/sosex_64.zip).

The following table gives an overview of these additional commands.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - When a command from this table is executed in WinDbg, the command must be prefixed with `!`.
> - This extension is not loaded by default in WinDbg. To load it, use `.load <filePathToSosexAssembly>`. Note that for analyzing a 32-bit process, the 32-bit version of the DLL should be loaded.
