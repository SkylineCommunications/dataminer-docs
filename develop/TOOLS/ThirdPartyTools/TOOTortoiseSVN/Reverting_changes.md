# Reverting changes

If, for example, you have made changes to a file by accident, then do not commit this file.

Instead, right-click the file and select *TortoiseSVN*Â > *Revert*. This will make sure that the changes you made locally to the file will be undone. If you were to commit the file instead, the changes would have to be reverted on the repository.
