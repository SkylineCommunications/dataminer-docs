# Repository

A repository on a SubVersion server contains all version controlled files.

Different repositories are available for each department.

- The System Engineering repository is located at <https://svn.skyline.be/svn/SystemEngineering/>.

- The Quality Assurance repository is located at <https://svn.skyline.be/svn/QualityAssurance/>.

- The Internal Tools repository is located at <https://svn.skyline.be/svn/InternalTools/>.

A Skyline domain account is required in order to be able to login.

The repository is only accessible from within the Skyline network.

> [!NOTE]
> Access to the repositories is restricted, so that teams can only access a particular repository if it is relevant to them.
