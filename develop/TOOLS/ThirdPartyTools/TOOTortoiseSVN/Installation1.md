# Installation

TortoiseSVN is an Apache Subversion client that is implemented as a Windows Shell extension. It creates extra functionality on directories and files.

The latest version of the client can be downloaded from the following website: <https://tortoisesvn.net/>. Be aware that this page displays an advertisement banner. Do not click any download buttons in this banner, as this will not download TortoiseSVN.

The installation is straightforward and does not require any special interaction.
