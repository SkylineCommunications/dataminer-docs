# RawCap

RawCap is a free command line network sniffer for Windows that uses raw sockets. It can sniff any interface that has an IP address, including 127.0.0.1 (localhost/loopback).

You can download this tool from the [Netresec website](http://www.netresec.com/?page=RawCap).

RawCap generates a packet capture file (.pcap), which can be opened in Wireshark.
