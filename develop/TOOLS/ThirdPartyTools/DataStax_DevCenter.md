# DataStax DevCenter

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tool is **no longer supported**. We recommend using a different query tool of your choice, e.g. [DbVisualizer](https://www.dbvis.com/).

This deprecated tool was used to perform CQL queries or run scripts on a Cassandra database on any server. It was included in legacy DataMiner installers prior to v10.2.

If the tool has been installed on the DMA, you can open it by going to the folder `C:\Program Files\Cassandra\DevCenter\` and double-clicking *Run DevCenter.lnk*.
