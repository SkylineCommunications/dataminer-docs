# Skyline Driver Passport Platform

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section might include some information that is only applicable to Skyline employees and/or links that are only accessible to Skyline employees.

The Skyline Driver Passport Platform allows you to schedule remote installations of an application package and will measure the performance impact. You can define and create any test; the only requirement is that the test should be included in an application package (.dmapp) or a test package (.dmt) and the intent should be to obtain performance KPIs from that test.

The primary goal of the platform is to obtain performance scaling results of a connector and performance indications from a DMS Solution in an automated flow. This information can for example be used to get an estimate of how many elements of a certain protocol can run on a DMA or what the performance impact of a protocol is. It allows you to detect anomalies and take action if needed to improve a protocol.

You can configure and schedule remote installations of a DataMiner package on the platform (with and without simulation) and results will automatically be stored in Test Management Platform TestLink.

The Driver Passport Platform protocol uses:

- A Microsoft Platform and SL_SystemHealthCheck element to obtain CPU and memory values, and to detect leaks on the remote DMA.

- The Skyline Device Simulator to simulate behavior of real devices.
