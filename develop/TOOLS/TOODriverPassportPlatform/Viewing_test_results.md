# Viewing test results

Once a test has run its course, a test plan will automatically be created by the Skyline Driver Passport Platform, using the defined test name in the defined test project.

For each test plan build, test cases are inserted corresponding to each DMAPP used for this test.

You can view the results of a test via the TestLink instance at <https://slc-h57-g02.skyline.local/TestLink/login.php>.

To view test results, in the top menu bar, click the *Test Reports* icon, and then select the test plan for which you want to view a report.

The option *Test Report* or *Test Report on build* allows you to generate a summary of a test.

### Test case - execution steps

Below you can find an overview of all steps executed by the generated TestLink test plan.
