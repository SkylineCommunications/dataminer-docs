# Simulations

Before you can simulate SNMP or HTTP devices, you need to capture the data that is available on those devices. The following sections will tell you how.

> [!NOTE]
> All simulation files must be placed in the folder *C:\\QASNMPSimulations*. The first time you start the tool, this folder will automatically be created.

- [Creating SNMP simulations](xref:Creating_SNMP_simulations)

- [Creating HTTP simulations](xref:Creating_HTTP_simulations)

- [Running simulations](xref:Running_simulations)

- [Static simulations](xref:Static_simulations)

- [Artificial dynamic simulations](xref:Artificial_dynamic_simulations)

- [Realistic dynamic simulations](xref:Realistic_dynamic_simulations)


> [!NOTE]
> The tool currently doesn't support serial simulations. For now, serial communication can be simulated via our “Skyline Serial Simulator” protocol.
