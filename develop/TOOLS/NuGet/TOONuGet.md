# NuGet packages

NuGet is the package manager for .NET. DIS and our CI/CD pipeline provide tools to produce and consume NuGet packages for use in system development (connectors, Automation scripts, custom solutions). A package is a collection of DLLs (and possibly also other items) with well-tested code that can easily be distributed, upgraded, and shared.

The NuGet Gallery (<https://nuget.org>) is the central package repository used by all package authors and consumers.

Within Skyline, we also use an internal NuGet server: <https://devcore3/nuget>.
