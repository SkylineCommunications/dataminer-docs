# Licensing problem

## Problem

Even though DIS is freely available, it can occur that the license check fails.

## Possible solutions

1. Check if you can reach [SkylineAPI](https://api.skyline.be/Help).

   If not, check the certification and make sure it is allowed in your network.

1. Check if you can log in to SkylineAPI.

   If not, check if you are using the right credentials.

1. If the issue persists, check if your PC is still in sync with the time server.

   Try disabling the synchronization and enabling it again, because the information shown by Windows is not always correct.

If the issue still persists after you have tried the solutions above, report the issue to Skyline, making sure to include the following information:

- The account that you use in DIS.

- The DIS [output logging](xref:DIS_Troubleshooting_RetrieveInformation#visual-studio-output-logging).
