# DIS Inject problems

## Breakpoints are not hit

### Problem

After clicking *Attach* in the *DIS Inject* window and running the code, the breakpoints are not hit.

### Possible solutions

- Projects need to be built in [Debug mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/what-is-debugging?view=vs-2022#debug-mode-vs-running-your-app).

  DIS will run the code, so you only need to make sure the configuration is set to *Debug*.

- In case multiple SLScripting processes are used, make sure you use [DIS 2.44](xref:DIS_2.44#dis-inject-attaching-the-visual-studio-debugger-to-multiple-slscripting-processes-id-37042) or higher, as DIS will then attach to all SLScripting processes.

## Could not find SLScripting process, is DataMiner running?

### Problem

After clicking *Attach* in the *DIS Inject* window, you get the following error:

```txt
Visual Studio needs to run as administrator to perform this action.
```

### Cause

Microsoft Visual Studio is not allowed to attach to the DataMiner SLScripting process.

### Solution

Run Microsoft Visual Studio as an administrator.

#### Changing the privilege level of VSLauncher.exe

1. Exit Microsoft Visual Studio.

1. In Windows Explorer, go to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\microsoft shared\MSEnv`.

1. Right-click *VSLauncher.exe* and select *Properties*.

1. In the *Properties* dialog box of *VSLauncher.exe*, go to the *Compatibility* tab.

1. In the *Settings* section, select the checkbox *Run this program as an administrator*.

1. Click *OK*.

#### Associating XML files with VSLauncher.exe

1. Right-click an XML file and select *Open With \> Choose Default Program*.

1. In the *Open With* dialog box, click *Browse.*

1. Go to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\microsoft shared\MSEnv`, select *VSLauncher.exe* and click *Open*.

1. Select the checkbox *Always use the selected program to open this kind of file* and click *OK*.
