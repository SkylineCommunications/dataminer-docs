# DIS Inject

If you click *Tool Windows > DIS Inject*, the *DIS Inject* window will appear.

By default, the *DIS Inject* window will open undocked. Dock it just as you would dock any other tool window in Visual Studio.

This tool window allows you to make the necessary preparations before debugging the connector QAction(s) or Automation script C# Exe block(s) you are editing.

For step-by-step instructions on how to debug connector QActions and Automation script C# Exe blocks, see [Debugging connectors and Automation scripts](xref:Debugging_connectors_and_Automation_scripts).

## Connecting to one of the Agents specified in the DIS settings

When you open the *DIS Inject* window, and you have not yet set up a connection to one of the DMAs specified in the *DMA* tab of the *DIS Settings* window, a large *Connect* button will appear in the middle of the window. Click that button to connect DataMiner Integration Studio to the default Agent. If you want to connect to another, non-default Agent, click the drop-down button at the right of the *Connect* button, and click the Agent to which you want to connect.

See [Connect](xref:DIS_menu) and [DMA](xref:DIS_settings#dma)

> [!NOTE]
> The title of the *DIS Inject* window includes the name of the Agent to which DIS is connected (between brackets). When DIS is not connected to any Agent, the window title will include "(not connected)".

## Debugging a connector QAction

Go to the *Protocol* tab if you want to debug a connector QAction.

### Selecting an element from the connected DMA

Use the selection box at the top of the window to select the element to be used during the debugging operation. This must be an element that uses the exact same protocol as the one you are currently editing.

### Manipulating the selected element

Below the element selection box you can find the element manipulation tool bar. From left to right, the buttons on this toolbar allow you to:

- Start the element
- Pause the element
- Stop the element
- Restart the element
- Open the element in *Element Display*
- Open the element in *DataMiner Cube*
- Open the elementâ€™s log file.

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > - If DIS is connected to a remote DataMiner Agent, then make sure the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\logging* folder on that DataMiner Agent is shared and accessible.
  > - Element Display is no longer available from DataMiner 9.6.0 onwards.

### Linking temporary QAction projects to QActions in the protocol of the selected element

When you have selected an element in the element selection box, the *DIS Inject* window will list all QActions found in the protocol of the selected element, and will automatically link the temporary projects of the QActions that are being edited to the QActions in the list based on protocol name and QAction ID.

When, for example, you open a QAction with ID 12, then the temporary project will be named "QAction_12". By default, when you open the *DIS Inject* window while editing QAction 12, then the *Project* selection box in row 12 will be set to "QAction_12". If you want to override this default linking mechanism, and you want to link a different temporary project to a particular QAction, open the *Project* selection box, and select another project.

| If you click... | then... |
|-----------------|---------|
| the green plus, | you will replace (i.e. inject) the element's *QAction.dll* file (compiled in Release mode) with its counterpart found in the temporary QAction project (compiled in Debug mode). |
| the red X, | you will sever the temporary link between the element and the *QAction.dll* compiled in Debug mode.<br> This will restore the link between the element and its original *QAction.dll* (compiled in Release mode). |
| the yellow lightning bolt, | you will manually trigger the QAction by simulating a change of the parameter selected in the *Trigger ID* box (in case of a dynamic table parameter, use the *Trigger Key* box to specify the table row).<br>Only do this after you have attached the SLScripting process(es) to the Debugger. |

### Attaching the Microsoft Visual Studio Debugger to the DataMiner SLScripting process(es)

After injecting the necessary *QAction.dll* files, you have to attach the Debugger to the SLScripting process(es).

| If you click... | then... |
|-----------------|---------|
| Attach | all temporary QAction projects will be built, and the Microsoft Visual Studio Debugger will be attached to the DataMiner SLScripting process(es).<br>Note: The design of the Microsoft Visual Studio screen will change and you will notice the word "Running" in the title bar. |
| Detach | the Microsoft Visual Studio Debugger will be detached from the DataMiner SLScripting process(es). |

## Debugging an Automation script

Go to the *Automation script* tab if you want to debug an Automation script.

### Selecting an Automation script from the connected DMA

Use the selection box at the top of the tab to select the Automation script to be debugged.

### Linking Exe block projects, assigning values to script parameters, and linking elements to script dummies

- In the Exe blocks list, go to the row of which the Exe ID matches that of the Exe block you have opened. If necessary, in the *Project* column, select another temporary Exe block project.
- In the script parameters list, assign a value to each of the script parameters in the list.
- In the script dummies list, link a DataMiner element to each of the script dummies in the list.

### Attaching the Microsoft Visual Studio Debugger to the DataMiner SLAutomation process

After linking the Exe block projects, assigning values to the script parameters, and linking elements to the script dummies, you have to attach the Debugger to the SLAutomation process.

| If you click... | then... |
|-----------------|---------|
| Attach | all temporary Exe block projects will be built, and the Microsoft Visual Studio Debugger will be attached to the DataMiner SLAutomation process.<br> Note: The design of the Microsoft Visual Studio screen will change and you will notice the word "Running" in the title bar. |
| Detach | the Microsoft Visual Studio Debugger will be detached from the DataMiner SLAutomation process. |

### Triggering the Automation script

Click *Execute* to manually trigger the Automation script.
