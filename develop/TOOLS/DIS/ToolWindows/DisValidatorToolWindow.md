# DIS Validator

If you click *Tool Windows > DIS Validator*, the *DIS Validator* window will appear.

This window lists the results of the latest protocol validation in a tree structure, grouped by severity and category.

At the top of the tool window, you can find two buttons:

- Click *Validate* to launch a new protocol validation.

- Click *Export* to export the results of the latest validation to a CSV file.

As of DIS v2.41, when you open a main DVE protocol and click *Validate*, DIS will not only validate the main protocol but also all its exported child DVE protocols.
