# DIS Mapping

If you click *Tool Windows > DIS Mapping*, the *DIS Mapping* window will appear.

This tool window allows you to visualize relationships between items in the protocol you are working on.

By default, the *DIS Mapping* window will open undocked. Dock it just as you would dock any other tool window in Visual Studio.

- In the topmost selection box, select the type of items of which you want to see a list. Next to each type, you will see the number of items of that type in the current protocol.

- In the list box underneath the selection box, which lists all items of the selected type, select an item by clicking its ID.

- The lowest list box lists all items that have a link to the item selected in the list box above.

If, for example, you select an Action, then

- the *Outgoing* list will show all items to which the selected Action contains a link,

- the *Incoming* list will show all items that contain a link to the selected Action, and

- the *Conditions* list will show all items referred to in the Actionâ€™s \<Condition> element.

| If... | then... |

| you click the name of an item in the topmost list box (notice that the name turns into a hyperlink!), | the cursor in the file tab containing the protocol code will jump to the tag that defines the item you selected in the topmost list box. |
| you double-click an item in the lowest list box, | the item you double-clicked will be selected in the topmost list box.<br> Note: The selection box at the top of the *DIS Mapping* window will be set to the type of the item you double-clicked. |
| you click the type of an item in the lowest list box (notice that the type turns into a hyperlink!), | the cursor in the file tab containing the protocol code will jump to the tag that defines the item you selected in the lowest list box. |
