# Developing Automation scripts as Visual Studio solutions

As from DIS v2.31, similar to DataMiner protocols, it is also possible to develop Automation scripts as Visual Studio solutions.

- An Automation script solution can contain multiple scripts, while a protocol solution can only contain one single protocol.

- C# projects that contain the code for the Exe blocks of an Automation script can contain multiple .cs files. At compilation, the contents of those files will be combined into one Exe block.

- DLL imports need to be configured on the C# project itself by adding references to the external components. These can be external DLL files (located in C:\\DataMiner\\ProtocolScripts or C:\\DataMiner\\Files) or other scripts in the same solution.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want an external DLL file to be placed in a specific folder instead of C:\\DataMiner\\ProtocolScripts, then specify the full path to that folder in the *DataMiner DLL Path* property of that DLL file.

- â€‹Up to DIS v2.40, it was only possible to refer to a library script Exe from within the same Automation script. As from DIS v 2.41, in a Visual Studio solution, you can also add a reference to a project from another Automation script in the solution. DIS will then automatically add a `scriptRef`.

  See the following example, in which `{SCRIPTNAME}` is the name of the other script containing the library and `{LIBRARYNAME}` is the name of the library:

  ```xml
  <Param type="scriptRef">{SCRIPTNAME}:{LIBRARYNAME}</Param>
  ```

  As DIS will automatically add a `scriptRef`, developers will only need to add a reference to the project that represents the library.

## Creating an Automation Script solution

To create a new Automation script solution containing one dummy Automation script, do the following:

1. Select *File \> New \> DataMiner Automation Script Solution...*
1. Enter the name of the solution.
1. Select the target folder.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The default protocol solution folder and the default Automation script folder can both be specified in DIS Settings \> Solutions.

1. Select *Create initial Automation script* if you want to solution to contain a basic script with one Exe block.
1. Click *OK*.

> [!NOTE]
> If another solution is open when you perform step 1, you will be asked whether you want to save unsaved changes.

## Creating a new script in a solution

To create a new script in an Automation script solution, do the following:

1. Open the Automation script solution.
1. Select *File \> New \> New DataMiner Automation Script...* or right-click a solution folder in the Solution Explorer and select *Add \> New DataMiner Automation Script...*
1. Enter the name of the new script.
1. Click *OK*.

## Adding an existing script to a solution

To add an existing Automation script to an Automation script solution, do the following:

1. Right-click a solution folder in the Solution Explorer.
1. Select *Add \> Existing DataMiner Automation Script*.
1. Select a least one Automation script file.
1. Click *Open*.

> [!NOTE]
> When you add existing scripts to an Automation script solution, they are automatically converted to the correct format. For each Exe block, a C# project is created, and the code in that Exe block is transferred to the newly created C# project.

## Saving a compiled script to a file

A compiled Automation script can be saved either as an XML file or as a *.dmapp* package.

To save a compiled Automation script

1. Open the XML file containing the Automation script that you want to compile.
1. Select *File \> Save Compiled Script As...*
1. In the *Save As* window, select a folder, enter a file name, set *Save as type* to either "Automation script package (\*.dmapp)" or "Automation script file (\*.xml)", and click *Save*.

If you choose to save an Automation script as a package, the package will contain the Automation script as well as all required DLL files (e.g. DLL files of NuGet packages that are used in the Automation script).

## Saving all compiled scripts in a solution to a zip file

To save a compiled version of all Automation scripts in a solution to a zip file (with all C# code in their Exe blocks), do the following:

1. Open the XML files containing the Automation scripts that you want to compile.
1. Select *File \> Save All Compiled Scripts As...*
1. Enter a file name and a folder.
1. Click *Save*.

## Uploading a script to a DataMiner Agent

To upload an Automation script to a DataMiner Agent, do the following:

1. Open the XML file containing the Automation script.
1. Click *Publish* to compile the script and publish it to the DataMiner Agent that was set as default DMA in the *DMA* tab of the *DIS Settings* dialog box.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to publish the script to another, non-default DMA, click the drop-down button at the right of the *Publish* button, and click the DMA to which you want the file to be published.
