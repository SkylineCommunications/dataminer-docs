# Preparing to debug on the local DataMiner Agent

Proceed as follows if you want to debug a QAction or an automation script located on the DataMiner Agent that is running on your local computer.

1. Run Visual Studio as an Administrator.
1. Make sure that, in the *DMA* tab of the *DIS Settings* window, you have added your local DataMiner Agent with the correct user account and you have not selected its *Enable remote debugging* option.

   See [DMA](xref:DIS_settings#dma)

You are now ready to start debugging. See [Debugging a connector](xref:Debugging_a_connector) or [Debugging an automation script](xref:Debugging_an_Automation_script).
