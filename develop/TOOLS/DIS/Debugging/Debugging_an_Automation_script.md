# Debugging an Automation script

When you have finished configuring all necessary settings, you can start debugging.

1. In the *DIS* menu, go to *DMA \> Connect*, and select the DataMiner Agent to which you want DIS to connect.
1. Import the Automation script. In the *DIS* menu, select *DMA \> Import Automation script*, select an Automation script, and click *Import*.
1. In the XML editor, go to the Exe block that you want to debug, and click the *Edit C#* button in front of it to open the Exe block in a C# editor.
1. In the C# editor, set the necessary breakpoints.
1. In the *DIS* menu, select *Tool Windows \> DIS Inject* to open the *DIS Inject* window.
1. Select the *Automation script* tab.
1. Open the large selection box at the top of the window, and select the Automation script that you want to debug.
1. In the Exe blocks list:

    1. Go to the row of which the Exe ID matches that of the Exe block you have opened.
    1. If necessary, in the *Project* column, select another temporary Exe block project.

1. In the script parameters list, assign a value to each of the script parameters in the list.
1. In the script dummies list, link a DataMiner element to each of the script dummies in the list.
1. Click the *Attach* button to build all temporary Exe block projects and attach the Microsoft Visual Studio Debugger to the DataMiner SLAutomation process.
1. In the *DIS Inject* window, click Execute to manually trigger the Automation script.

> [!NOTE]
> - Automation script debugging only works in conjunction with DataMiner Agents running at least DataMiner Main Release Version 10.1.0 or Feature Release Version 10.0.6.
> - Automation script debugging currently does not support memory files yet.

> [!TIP]
> Debugging is often not possible for [third-party libraries](xref:TOONuGet). [dotPeek](xref:dotPeek) can serve as a handy tool to overcome this.
