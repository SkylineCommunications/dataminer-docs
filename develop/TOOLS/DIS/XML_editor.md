# XML editor

If you open a protocol XML file or an Automation script XML file in Microsoft Visual Studio, or if you create a new file from scratch, that file will appear in a customized file tab.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - To create a new protocol XML file, go to File \> New \> File \> General \> DataMiner, select DataMiner Protocol Template, and click Open.
> - To create a new Automation script XML file, select File \> New \> File \> General \> DataMiner, select DataMiner Automation Script Template, and click Open.
> - To create a new function XML file, select File \> New \> File \> General \> DataMiner, select DataMiner Function Template, click Open, specify the function file version, select the associated protocol XML file, and click OK.

## File tab header

After you install the *DataMinerIntegrationStudio.vsix* extension, a file tab containing a protocol XML file or an Automation script XML file will have a custom header containing a number of buttons as well as a search box.

### Validate

If you opened a protocol XML file, click *Validate* to check for errors that cannot be detected by the XML schema.

Since DIS v.2.13, a next-generation Validator runs side by side with the legacy Validator, which will be retired at a later stage. The next-generation Validator is extremely modular in design and allows for easy creation of a wide range of code checks and unit tests.

As of DIS v2.41, when you open a main DVE protocol and click *Validate*, DIS will not only validate the main protocol but also all its exported child DVE protocols.

After having validated a protocol, you can ask DIS to automatically fix a number of common errors: replace all invalid characters in a parameter name with an underscore, trimming tag contents, etc. In the *DIS Validator* pane, all errors that can be fixed automatically will be marked by a “wrench and screwdriver” icon.

- To fix an error marked by a “wrench and screwdriver” icon, right-click the error, and select *Fix \> This error*. If the error has successfully been fixed, it will be removed from the *DIS Validator* pane.

To fix all errors of one particular type or severity at the same time, do the following:

- To fix all errors of a particular type, right-click an error, and select *Fix \> All errors of this type*.
- To fix all errors of a particular severity, right-click that severity, and select *Fix \> All errors in this category*.

When, for an error listed in the *DIS Validator* pane, there is more information available than what is being displayed, an information icon will appear next to the description. If you click such an information icon, the additional information will be displayed in a pop-up window.

Note that when you try to fix an error with warnings, a popup window may appear to draw your attention to those warnings. Only when you click *OK* in that popup window will the error be fixed.

When you right-click an error in the list, a shortcut menu offers you the following options:

| Command | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Navigate | Go to the line in the protocol that triggered the error. |
| Copy | Copy the error to the Windows Clipboard. |
| Show Details... | Show all details of the error in a separate window. |
| Suppress... | Suppress the error.<br> Note: Click the *Show/hide suppressed results* button to include/exclude the suppressed errors in/from the list. |
| Postpone \> This error... | |
| Postpone \> All errors of this type... ||

> [!NOTE]
>
> - In the DIS Validator pane, you can select multiple items. To select more than one item, click one, and then click another while holding down the CTRL key, etc. To select a list of consecutive items, click the first one in the list and then click the last one while holding down the SHIFT key. Use this feature to e.g. copy, suppress or postpone a number of results in one go. However, note that suppressing or postponing a number of results will only work when all selected items have the same error code.
> - Use the filter box in the top-right corner to filter the validation results.

### Compare

If you want to compare two protocols, do the following:

1. At the top of an XML editor tab containing a protocol.xml file, click *Compare*.
1. In the *DIS Comparer* tool window, select the two protocols to be compared.

    To select a protocol (either on the left or on the right), do the following:

    1. Click *Select protocol...*
    1. In the Select Protocol... window, select an option:

        - Select *Opened protocol*, and select one of the protocols currently opened in the XML editor.
        - Select *File*, click *Select protocol...*, and select a protocol.xml file located in a file folder.
        - Select *Previous release*, and select one of the previous versions of a protocol currently opened in the XML editor.

        > [!NOTE]
        >
        > - If you select *File* or *Previous release* when working inside a solution, the protocol you select will not be added to the solution.
        > - For the *Previous release* option to work, the DataMiner Integration Studio has to be able to connect to `https://api.skyline.be/*`.

    1. Click *OK*.

    After selecting the two protocols, the comparison will start automatically.

1. If necessary, click *Compare* to redo the comparison or click *Export* to have the result of the comparison exported to a CSV file.

When you compare two protocols, DIS will also automatically validate both these protocols. When comparison and validation have finished, you will see two tabs:

- *Major Change* - The result of the protocol comparison.
- *Validator* - The differences between the two protocol validations.

When you right-click an error in the list, a shortcut menu offers you the following options:

| Command | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Navigate | Go to the line in the protocol that triggered the error. |
| Copy | Copy the error to the Windows Clipboard. |
| Show Details... | Show all details of the error in a separate window. |
| Suppress... | Suppress the error.<br> Note: Click the *Show/hide suppressed results* button to include/exclude the suppressed errors in/from the list. |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - In the DIS Comparer pane, you can select multiple items. To select more than one item, click one, and then click another while holding down the CTRL key, etc. To select a list of consecutive items, click the first one in the list and then click the last one while holding down the SHIFT key. Use this feature to e.g. copy or suppress a number of results in one go. However, note that suppressing a number of results will only work when all selected items have the same error code.
> - Use the filter box in the top-right corner to filter the comparison results.

### Refactor

If you opened a protocol XML file that has not yet been edited in DataMiner Integration Studio, click *Refactor* right after opening the file. That way, the file will be made “DIS compliant”.

Changes made to the protocol XML file include:

- Adding a namespace reference to the *\<Protocol>* tag
- Changing the casing of attribute values
- ...

### Display Editor

If you opened a protocol XML file, and you click *Display Editor*, the file tab will be turned into a graphical interface editor.

This editor allows you to design the Data Display pages of a protocol using simple drag-and-drop operations.

> [!TIP]
> See also: [Display editor](xref:Display_editor)

### Table editor

If you opened a protocol XML file, and you click *Table Editor*, the file tab will be turned into a graphical table editor.

This editor allows you to design the parameter tables of a protocol using simple drag-and-drop operations.

> [!TIP]
> See also: [Table editor](xref:Table_editor)

### Publish

If you click *Publish*, the protocol or the Automation script you are currently editing will be published to the DMA that was set as default DMA in the *DMA* tab of the *DIS Settings* dialog box.

To publish a protocol or an Automation script to another, non-default DMA, click the drop-down button at the right of the *Publish* button, and click the DMA to which you want the file to be published.

When you publish a protocol or an Automation script, DIS will create either a *.dmprotocol* package (in case of a protocol) or a *.dmapp* package (in case of an Automation script) in the background, install that package on the DataMiner Agent, and then automatically remove it again. This way, there is no need to manually copy all required DLL files on the DataMiner Agent in question (e.g. DLL files of NuGet packages that are used in the protocol or Automation script).

> [!TIP]
> See also: [DMA](xref:DIS_settings#dma)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - You cannot click the *Publish* button when Visual Studio is running in debug mode.
> - DIS will refuse to publish a protocol
>   - when the *Protocol.Type* tag contain an incorrect value,
>   - when the *Protocol.Version* tag is empty, or
>   - when the *Protocol.Name* tag is empty.

### Update

If DataMiner Integration Studio is set to check for updates, an *Update* button will appear if a newer version of the *DataMinerIntegrationStudio.vsix* file is available.

If you click the *Update* button, the *Update* dialog box will ask whether you want to update DataMiner Integration Studio. To update, click *Update now*.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also download the latest version of the *DataMinerIntegrationStudio.vsix* file from [DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-integration-studio-other-downloads/), and then update DataMiner Integration Studio by simply double-clicking the *DataMinerIntegrationStudio.vsix* file.

> [!TIP]
> See also: [Updates](xref:DIS_settings#updates)

### Search

If, in the search box on the right, you enter a word, then all instances of that word will be highlighted throughout the XML file you are editing.

In the search box, you can enter either a single word or a series of words separated by spaces. You can also specify a piece of text surrounded by double quotes.

| If you enter... | then... |
|-----------------|---------|
| a single word, | all instances of that word will be highlighted throughout the XML file. |
| a series of words separated by spaces, | all instances of every specified word will be highlighted throughout the XML file.<br> Note: Every word will be highlighted in a different color. |
| a piece of text surrounded by double quotes, | all instances of that specific piece of text will be highlighted throughout the XML file. |

Note that highlighting can also be very useful to pinpoint instances of specific words when tags are collapsed.

#### Find next, Find all

When you enter words in the search box, those words will immediately be highlighted in the XML file. You do not need to press *ENTER*. If you do press *ENTER* or *CTRL+ENTER*, you will notice the following behavior.

| If you press... | then... |
|-----------------|---------|
| *ENTER*, | The cursor will jump to the first instance of the word in the search box.<br> Pressing *ENTER* again will make the cursor jump to the next instance of the word.<br> Note: If the search box contains a series of words separated by spaces, only the first word will be taken into account. |
| *CTRL+ENTER*, | A *Find Results* pane will appear at the bottom of the screen, listing all instances of the word in the search box.<br> Double-clicking a line in the *Find Results* pane will make the cursor jump to the instance referred to by that line.<br> Note: If the search box contains a series of words separated by spaces, only the first word will be taken into account. |

#### Case sensitivity

If you want to override the default case sensitivity setting in a particular file tab, you can switch between “Case sensitive” and “Ignore case” by clicking the *aA* button to the right of the search box.

> [!TIP]
> See also: [Interface](xref:DIS_settings#interface)

#### Wildcard interpretation

If you want to override the default wildcard interpretation setting in a particular file tab, you can switch between “Treat as literal string” and “Interpret as wildcards” by clicking the *\*?* button to the right of the search box.

> [!TIP]
> See also: [Interface](xref:DIS_settings#interface)

## Inside the file tab

### Using the right-click menu commands

When you right-click inside the file tab, a shortcut menu appears. Apart from the standard Visual Studio commands, you can perform a number of additional actions.

| Select... | in order to... |
|-----------|----------------|
| Copy Protocol to Clipboard | Copy the entire content of the protocol XML file to the Windows Clipboard. |
| Copy Code to Clipboard | Copy the entire content of the file to the Windows Clipboard.<br> When you use this menu option while working with a protocol solution or an Automation script solution, you will not only copy the current file to the Windows Clipboard, but all files of the entire solution combined in a way that is similar to the way they are combined when the solution is compiled. |
| Generate Parameters | Automatically generate \<Param> tags (as well as all the necessary \<Timer>, \<Group>, \<Trigger> and \<Action> tags) based on parameter data in a MIB file, an XML file, a JSON file, a WSDL file or an Ember+ file.<br> See [Generating parameters from data stored in external files](#generating-parameters-from-data-stored-in-external-files) |
| Generate Write Parameters | Create a Write parameter for a selected Read parameter.<br> See [Generating Write parameters for Read parameters](#generating-write-parameters-for-read-parameters) |
| Repeat Selected Text | Copy the text you selected a number of times.<br> See [Repeating selected text](#repeating-selected-text) |
| Outlining \> Toggle Outlining at Level \[X\] | Collapse all protocol tags at a certain level of depth.<br> Examples:<br> -  If you click *Toggle Outlining at Level 1*, all level-1 tags (e.g. the \<Protocol> tag) will be collapsed.<br> -  If you click *Toggle Outlining at Level 2*, all level-2 tags (e.g. the \<Params> tag, the \<Commands> tag, etc.) will be collapsed. |
| Snippet \> Insert Snippet \> DIS | Insert a protocol or Automation script snippet. |

### Generating parameters from data stored in external files

If you want to automatically generate *\<Param>* tags (as well as all the necessary *\<Timer>*, *\<Group>*, *\<Trigger>* and *\<Action>* tags) based on parameter data in a MIB file, an XML file, a JSON file, a WSL file or an Ember+ file, then do the following:

1. Position the mouse cursor anywhere in the XML editor, right-click, and select *Generate Parameters*.
1. In the *Generate Parameters Wizard* window, set *Input type* to “MIB”, “XML”, “JSON”, “WSDL” or “EmberPlus”.
1. Depending on the choice you made in step 2, do the following:

    | If you selected ... | then ... |
    |---------------------|----------|
    | MIB | Click *Next*. |
    | XML | \- Select *File input*, and select an XML file, or select *Text input*, and enter or paste the XML code in the text box.<br>- Click *Next*. |
    | JSON | \-  Select *File input*, and select a JSON file, or select *Text input*, and enter or paste the JSON code in the text box.<br>- Click *Next*. |
    | WSDL | Select a WSDL file, and click *Next*. |
    | EmberPlus | Select an Ember+ file, and click *Next*. |

1. Select the items that you want to convert into protocol parameters, and click *Next*.
1. Configure the following parameter ID settings, and click *Next*.

    | Setting | Description |
    |---------|-------------|
    | Start PID | In this box, you can specify the ID of the first parameter that is about to be created.<br> If, for example, you enter “1000”, then the first parameter will have ID 1000, the second parameter will have ID 1001, etc.<br> Default: 1000 |
    | Offset Read PID -><br>Write PID | If the parameter data indicates that a parameter can be updated, DataMiner Integration Studio will also generate a parameter of type “write”.<br> In this box, you can specify the offset between the ID of the parameter of type “read” and the ID of the parameter of type “write”.<br> Default: 100 |
    | Offset Read PID -><br>SNMP Write PID| If the parameter to be created is that of a writable table column, DataMiner Integration Studio will generate a second parameter of type “write”.<br> In this box, you can specify the offset between the ID of the parameter of type “read” and the ID of the second parameter of type “write”.<br> Default: 200 |
    | Offset Table PID -><br>Set Instance PID | If the parameter to be created is that of a table on which SET actions will be performed, then DataMiner Integration Studio will generate a so-called “instance parameter”, which will contain row instances.<br> In this box, you can specify the offset between the ID of the table parameter and the ID of the instance parameter.<br> Default: 900 |

1. If the list shows any ID conflicts between existing parameters and parameters that are about to be created, change the conflicting, new parameter IDs (which are marked in red), and click *Next*.
1. Define the necessary timers, and click *Next*.
1. Define the necessary groups, and click *Next*.
1. Define the parameter polling, and click *Finish*.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - When an XML/JSON node does not contain a value, a parameter of type “string” will be created, and a warning icon will appear next to the node in the XML/JSON source file.
> - Obsolete or deprecated MIB nodes will not be imported when you generate parameters based on MIB data.

### Generating Write parameters for Read parameters

If you want to automatically generate parameters of type “write” for a number of existing parameters of type “read”, do the following:

1. In the protocol XML file, select the \<Param> tags of the parameters of type “read” for which you want to generate a parameter of type “write”, right-click, and select *Generate Write Parameters.*

    In the *Generate Write Parameters* window, each read parameter in the list has a checkbox in front of it. This checkbox will by default be selected, meaning that a write parameter will be created when you click *OK*. However, if a read parameter already has an associated write parameter, then its checkbox will by default not be selected. This will prevent you from creating duplicate write parameters.

1. If, in the *Generate Write Parameters For Read Parameters* window, the list shows any ID or name conflicts between existing parameters and parameters that are about to be created, then change the conflicting, new parameter IDs and/or names (which are marked in red), and click *OK*.

    - Above the list, you can change the default ID offset (default offset: 1). This way, you can change the IDs of all listed parameters of type “write” in one go.
    - When in the *Write ID* column a suggested parameter ID is not available, you can click a “search for next available Write ID” button in the form of an arrow to replace the non-available ID by an available one.
    - The *Setter* column allows you to enable the “setter” attribute for a particular write parameter.

        If you want to enable this attribute for all non-SNMP parameters in the list, then you can select the “select all” checkbox in the column header. Note that, when the protocol does not contain any non-SNMP parameters, this “select all” checkbox will be disabled. As will all “setter” checkboxes for the SNMP parameters in the list.

    - The *SNMP Set and Get* column allows you to enable the “snmpSetAndGet” attribute for a particular write parameter.

        If you want to enable this attribute for all SNMP parameters in the list, select the “select all” checkbox in the column header. <br>Note that when the protocol does not contain any SNMP parameters, this “select all” checkbox will be disabled, as will all “SNMP Set and Get” checkboxes for the non-SNMP parameters in the list.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - As long as there is at least one row showing a duplicate parameter ID or duplicate parameter name, the *OK* button will be disabled and a warning icon will be displayed in the top-right corner of the window.
> - Only rows of which the checkbox is selected are taken into account when performing the above-mentioned validation.

### Repeating selected text

The right-click menu option *Repeat Selected Text* allows you to select a particular piece of text and have it copied a number of times. Moreover, by inserting variables and formulas in the text to be copied, you can have parts of the text change automatically from copy to copy.

1. Select the text that has to be repeated, right-click, and select *Repeat Selected Text.*
1. In the *DIS Repeater* window, if necessary, go to the *Template* box, and edit the text you want to have repeated.
1. If you want to insert a variable (or a formula including a variable) in the text to be repeated, then do the following:

    - Place your cursor where you want the variable or formula to be inserted, and click *Insert placeholder*.
    - If necessary, change the default placeholder that appeared at the location where you placed your cursor: a single value “x” delimited by “$” characters. You could change it to e.g. “$x+5$”.

1. At the bottom of the window, select *Overwrite Selection*, if you want the text you selected to be overwritten by the text that is currently displayed in the *Preview* box.
1. Click *OK* to have the text in the *Preview* box pasted in the editor.

#### Using “$” characters inside a formula

When you insert a variable or a formula into the text to be copied, that variable or formula is delimited by “$” characters. If you want to use a “$” character inside a formula, you have to put an escape character in front of it. Example: `$(x*10)+"\$"$`.

#### Defining the range of value “x”

The range of value “x” can be defined using the range definition boxes at the top of the window.

There are two ways to define the range:

- Specify a starting “x” value in *Start* and a number of iterations in *Count*.
- Specify a starting “x” value in *Start* and an ending “x” value in *End*.

In both cases, you can also specify a step size in *Step*.

### Tag shortcut menus

In the XML editor, you can click a small *Down* arrow in front of certain XML tags to open a shortcut menu. See the table below for an overview of all available commands per XML tag.

> - “Include in ...” and “Add Existing ...” lists do not close when you have selected an item. They will stay open to allow you to select multiple items.

### Intellisense and instant XML validation

If the root tag of the protocol XML file or the Automation script XML file you are editing contains a reference to the protocol or automation namespace, and if the protocol and Automation script schema files are in the Microsoft Visual Studio Schema folder, then the protocol XML file or the Automation script XML file you are editing will be validated against the protocol or Automation script schema while you type.

- When you type a “\<“ sign between two existing tags, a selection box will appear listing all tags you are allowed to insert at that location. After you select one of the proposed tags, a list will be presented with all possible attributes for that specific tag.
- When adding content to Commands, Responses, Pairs, Groups, Triggers, Timers, etc., an Intellisense pop-up will appear, listing all existing items that can be added. In case of a group, the listed items will depend on the type of the group, e.g. actions are only added to the list when the type is “action” or “poll action”.

#### DIS Validator tool window

All syntax errors in the XML file you are editing can be found in the *DIS Validator* tool window.

If the *DIS Validator* tool window is not displayed, choose *Tool Windows \> DIS Validator* from the DIS menu.

### Inserting snippets

DataMiner Integration Studio comes with a number of custom XML snippets.

To insert a snippet while working in the XML editor:

1. Press CTRL+K, followed by CTRL+X.
1. Open the *DIS \> Protocol* folder, and select a snippet. You may have to open an additional folder.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to insert a particular snippet without having to go through the above-mentioned snippet folder and all its subfolders, use the following shortcut:
>
> - At the location where you want to insert the snippet, enter “\<“, type the name of the XML tag (or select it from the Intellisense list), and press TAB.

### Context-sensitive help in tooltips

The DataMiner schema files contain online help information about the different tags and tag attributes that can be used in a protocol XML or an Automation script XML file.

Whenever you move your mouse pointer over a tag, an attribute or one of the preset values in an enum list, a tooltip will display a few lines of basic information. For more detailed information, the tooltips will refer to the DataMiner Development Library.

### Jump to linked item button

Next to certain items, you will find a button in the shape of a paper clip. When you hover over this paper clip, a list box will appear, listing all items that are in some way linked to the item in question (e.g. read parameters linked to write parameters, or group parameters linked to bit parameters).

All those linked items are then grouped by category. For example:

- the *Outgoing* list will show all items to which the item contains a link,
- the *Incoming* list will show all items that contain a link to the item,
- the *Conditions* list will show all items referred to in the item’s \<Condition> element (if applicable), etc.

When, in the list box, you click the type of a linked item (notice that the type turns into a hyperlink!), the cursor will jump to the tag that defines the item you selected.

### Edit Table button

In front of every table parameter, you will find an *Edit Table* button.

If you click such a button, the table parameter will be opened in the Table Editor. This will allow you to edit the table in a graphical environment.

### Edit C# button

In front of every QAction or Exe code block containing C# code, you will find an *Edit C#* button.

If you click such a button, a temporary C# project will be created, containing the code of that QAction or Exe code block. Also, the code of the QAction of Exe code block will appear in a new file tab.

### Virtual comments

When working in the XML editor, you will notice so-called “virtual comments” next to certain XML tags. They are called “virtual” because they cannot be found in the protocol XML file itself.

In the following screenshot, there are three “virtual comments” next to the three parameter tags. They contain the names found in the *\<Description>* tags of those parameters.

Next to *\<Param>30\</Param>*, for example, you can see *\<!-- System OR Table -->* because, in the parameter definition, the *\<Description>* tag contains “System OR Table”.
