# historySet attribute

<!-- RN 4383 -->

Specifies that history sets are enabled for this parameter, allowing historical data to be recorded and accessed accurately.

## Content Type

[EnumTrueFalse](xref:Protocol-EnumTrueFalse)

## Parent

[Param](xref:Protocol.Params.Param)

## Remarks

If this attribute is not enabled and a history set is performed, the data may not be saved properly, leading to inaccurate results when accessing or visualizing past data, such as in trend graphs.

For tables, the historySet attribute only needs to be enabled on the specific column parameters that will be used with a history set.

If you mark a parameter as a history set parameter, its last set value will not be stored in the trending database when the element is restarted.

## Examples

```xml
<Param id="1" historySet="true">
```
