## Remarks

> [!NOTE]
>
> - For optimal effect, the blankInterval should be less than the blinkInterval.
> - There are also several optional filter attributes to enable blinking of alarms based on certain conditions. For more information, see [Making alarms without owner blink](xref:Making_alarms_without_owner_blink).
