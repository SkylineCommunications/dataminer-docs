## Attributes

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [maxAttachmentSize](xref:MaintenanceSettings.WatchDog.ProcessMonitor-maxAttachmentSize) | integer |  | Specifies the maximum size of the attachments in MB. |
| [maxInHour](xref:MaintenanceSettings.WatchDog.ProcessMonitor-maxInHour) | integer |  | Specifies the maximum number of allowed automatic restarts per hour. |
| [maxProcess](xref:MaintenanceSettings.WatchDog.ProcessMonitor-maxProcess) | integer |  | Defines the expected minimum number of monitored processes. If the number of terminated processes exceeds this value, the system interprets it as a critical failure and may initiate a full restart or halt further automatic restarts to prevent unstable operation. |
| [maxTimeout](xref:MaintenanceSettings.WatchDog.ProcessMonitor-maxTimeout) | string |  | When a full DataMiner restart is required because of the disappearance of a critical process, this setting specifies the number of minutes to wait before performing a full DataMiner restart. |
| [passwordOnAttachment](xref:MaintenanceSettings.WatchDog.ProcessMonitor-passwordOnAttachment) | boolean |  | Specifies whether a password is applied on the attachments. |

| Name | Occurrences | Description |

## Remarks

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If these tags are not specified, the default values will be used.
> - Customizing how long crashdump packages are kept does not require a DataMiner restart. However, these settings will only be applied once a crash dump package is created.
