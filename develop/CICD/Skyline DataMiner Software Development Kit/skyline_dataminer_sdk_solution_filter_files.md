# Visual Studio 2022 solution filter (*.slnf) files

A **solution filter** (.slnf) file in Visual Studio 2022 is a feature designed to load a subset of projects within a larger solution (`.sln`).

Working with solution filters has the following advantages:

- **Benefits in .NET and C# projects**

  Solution filters in Visual Studio 2022 are **essential** when working with **large .NET or C# solutions**. They allow you to reduce load times, focus on relevant projects, and improve productivity by providing a streamlined development environment. In large development projects, such as complex .NET or C# applications, solutions may consist of tens or hundreds of projects. Loading the entire solution can slow down the IDE, especially when you only need to work on a few core projects. Solution filters provide a way to:

  - Load only necessary projects.
  - Reduce Visual Studio's memory footprint.
  - Speed up build and debugging times for targeted development.

  Consider for example a .NET solution with multiple projects: a web API, a class library, and a set of unit tests. Suppose you are debugging a bug related to a library function. Instead of loading the entire solution, you can create a solution filter that includes only:

  - The class library project (*LibraryProject.csproj*).
  - The unit test project (*LibraryProject.Tests.csproj*).

  This setup ensures that you can focus on the relevant projects, reducing distractions and speeding up the development workflow.

- **Benefits in Skyline DataMiner SDK**

  Within Skyline DataMiner SDK, solution filters provide an additional key benefit, allowing you to easily **publish or build a specific subset of projects** by providing those dotnet-cli commands with a solution filter file. This can allow you to independently version or release different DataMiner application packages.

## Creating a solution filter

1. Open a solution (.sln) in Visual Studio 2022.

1. Select the projects you want to work with by unloading the others (right-click a project and select *Unload Project*).

1. Right-click the solution and select *Save As Solution Filter* and specify a name (e.g. `MyProjectSubset.slnf`).

This will generate a .slnf file that references the original .sln but only loads the selected projects.

## Switching between solution filters

Multiple .slnf files can be created for different contexts. For example:

- *CoreDevelopment.slnf* (loads core library and shared utilities)

- *WebAPIDevelopment.slnf* (loads the web API and its dependencies)

- *FullBuild.slnf* (loads everything for integration testing or deployment)

Developers can switch between these solution filters to tailor their working environment efficiently.

## Structure of a solution filter file

A basic example of a .slnf file:

```json
{
  "solution": {
    "path": "MySolution.sln"
  },
  "projects": [
    "src/MyProject/MyProject.csproj",
    "tests/MyProject.Tests/MyProject.Tests.csproj"
  ]
}
```

When you open this solution filter, only the *MyProject* and *MyProject.Tests* projects will be loaded.
