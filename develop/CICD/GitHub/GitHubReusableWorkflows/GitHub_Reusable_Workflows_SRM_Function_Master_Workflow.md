# SRM Function master workflow

IN DEVELOPMENT - NOT RELEASED

## How to use

From within your own workflow .yml files, you can call a reusable workflow by adding a job that references the location on GitHub of the .yml file:

For example:

```yml
jobs:

  CI:
    uses: SkylineCommunications/_ReusableWorkflows/.github/workflows/Automation Master Workflow.yml@main
```

For most reusable workflows, several arguments and secrets need to be provided. You can find out which arguments and secrets by opening the reusable workflow and looking at the "inputs:" and "secrets:" sections located at the top of the file.

However, we recommend that you instead use one of the available [starter workflows](xref:github_starter_workflows) that in turn call one of our reusable workflows and that are preconfigured with most of the arguments.

For example:

```yml
jobs:

  CI:
    uses: SkylineCommunications/_ReusableWorkflows/.github/workflows/Automation Master Workflow.yml@main
    with:
      referenceName: ${{ github.ref_name }}
      runNumber: ${{ github.run_number }}
      referenceType: ${{ github.ref_type }}
      repository: ${{ github.repository }}
      owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
      sonarCloudProjectName: TODO: Go to 'https://sonarcloud.io/projects/create' and create a project. Then enter the id of the project as mentioned in the SonarCloud project URL here.
      # The API-key: generated in the DCP Admin app (https://admin.dataminer.services/) as authentication for a certain DataMiner System.
    secrets:
      api-key: ${{ secrets.DATAMINER_DEPLOY_KEY }}
      sonarCloudToken: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
```
