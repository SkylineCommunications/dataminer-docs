An Interface containing logic with regard to 'interface utilization calculations' and 'interface counters discontinuity' has been added.

### 1.3.0.1

#### Overloads have been added for specifying primary/display key [ID_35048]

A number of IDmsColumn methods have been marked obsolete. They have now been replaced by new methods in which a KeyType will indicate whether a Primary Key or a Display Key is being used.

Also, an overload method for SetValue has been added to IDmsColumn to specify which KeyType is being used.
