# DataMiner System release notes

These release notes contain all new features, enhancements, and fixes for the core DataMiner software as well as built-in apps such the Dashboards app, the Ticketing app, etc.

> [!TIP]
> - For more information on the different release tracks, see [DataMiner Main Release vs. Feature Release](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-main-release-vs-feature-release/).
> - For detailed information on how to upgrade your DataMiner System, see [Upgrading your DataMiner system](https://community.dataminer.services/documentation/upgrading-your-dataminer-system/).

> [!NOTE]
> To get access to certain DataMiner features, such as suggestion events or the reports view in the Alarm Console, a Cassandra general database is required. This means that DataMiner Agents using a MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server general database need to migrate to Cassandra if you want to make use of these features.
> For more information on the requirements for the migration and on how to migrate to Cassandra, see [Migrating the general database to Cassandra](xref:Migrating_the_general_database_to_Cassandra).
