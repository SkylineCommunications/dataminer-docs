> [!NOTE]
> In DataMiner 10.5.11 or earlier, historical relational anomalies are not shown correctly.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Redesigned main screen layout [ID 43829]

A major redesign of the RAD Manager main screen has been implemented to enhance usability, provide better insights into relational anomaly groups, and align better with existing visual guidelines.

#### Historical anomalies panel [ID 43829]

From DataMiner version 10.5.12/10.6.0 onwards<!--RN43853-->, the historical anomalies for each relational anomaly group can be viewed within RAD Manager. In addition, the number of historical anomalies detected per group or subgroup is shown in the relational anomaly groups grid on the left-hand side of the main screen.

#### Support for shared model groups [ID 44091]

RAD Manager now supports shared model groups. These shared model groups can be added using the *Add Shared Model Group* button. Both single and shared model groups are displayed in the relational anomaly groups grid on the left-hand side of the main screen. The subgroups of a shared model group can be viewed by clicking the group tile.
