# DxM release notes

DataMiner Extension Modules (DxMs) expand the core DataMiner software with additional features and capabilities.

Many of the DxMs are used to interact with dataminer.services. These are included in the [Cloud Pack](xref:CloudPackages). Release notes for these DxMs can be found in the [**dataminer.services change log**](xref:DCP_change_log).

Other DxMs, such as [Data Aggregator](xref:Data_Aggregator_DxM) and [Communication Gateway](xref:DataMinerExtensionModules#communicationgateway) are not included in the Cloud Pack and need to be [installed via the Admin app](xref:Managing_cloud-connected_nodes#deploying-a-dxm-on-a-node). Release notes for these DxMs are documented separately.
