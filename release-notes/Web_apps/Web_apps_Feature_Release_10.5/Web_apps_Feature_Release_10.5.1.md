## New features

#### Low-Code Apps: New 'Set variable' action [ID 41253]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

It is now possible to configure *Set variable* actions.

This type of action will allow users to set the current value of any variable that is not read-only to either a static value or a value available elsewhere in the low-code app.

> [!NOTE]
> Variables of type *Table* can only be set to a static value.

#### Low-Code Apps: New 'Add row' and 'Clear table' actions [ID 41324]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] - FR 10.5.1 -->

It is now possible to configure the following actions:

| Action | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Add row     | Adds a row to a variable of type *Table*. |
| Clear table | Clears all rows defined in a variable of type *Table*. |

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Numeric input/Search input/Text input components : Default value [ID 41401]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] - FR 10.5.1 -->

The *Numeric input*, *Search input* and *Text input* components now allow you to specify a default value.

To do so, in edit mode, select the component, go to *Settings > General > Default value*, and enter a value.

#### Video thumbnails of type HTML5-HLS with multiple audio tracks will now allow you to select one of those audio tracks [ID 41407]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] - FR 10.5.1 -->

If the HLS stream of a video thumbnail of type HTML5-HLS has multiple audio tracks, the thumbnail will now have a drop-down box in which you can select one of the available audio tracks.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Dashboards app: Enhanced performance [ID 41148]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

Because of a number of enhancements with regard to file operations, overall performance has increased when working with the Dashboards app.

#### Low-Code Apps - Interactive Automation scripts: Redesigned UI components 'TextBox' and 'StaticText' [ID 41188]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] - FR 10.5.1 -->

The following UI components have been redesigned:

- `UIBlockType.StaticText`
- `UIBlockType.TextBox`

Currently, by default, the existing components will still be used by default to keep the UI aligned. If you want to use the new *StaticText* and *TextBox* components, then add the following argument to the URL of the low-code app:

`?useNewIASInputComponents=true`

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Pickers have been made more consistent [ID 41251]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When you create a variable of type *DOM instance*, you will now have to click *Apply* or *Cancel* after selecting a DOM instance.

In addition, the *Link to* data pickers have now been made more consistent. The *Apply* button has been renamed to *Link*, and will only be clickable when a valid link has been configured. Also, when you edit a link, an *Unlink* button will allow you to remove the link.

#### Web apps: Users will be redirected to the login screen when the connection cannot be restored [ID 41334]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

From now on, when the WebSocket is able to reconnect but the connection itself cannot be restored, users will be redirected to the login screen.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: New setting to enable or disable zooming in/out using Ctrl+Scroll [ID 41387]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] - FR 10.5.1 -->

Since feature version 10.4.9, the following components allow you to zoom in and out using Ctrl+Scroll. From now on, this behavior can be enabled or disabled in the *Layout* tab (in the *Node edge graph* and *Service definition* components) or the *Settings* tab (in the other components).

- Line & area chart
- Node edge graph
- Service definition
- Maps
- Visual Overview
- Timeline

By default, this option is disabled, meaning that you do not need to press Ctrl when zooming in or out.

### Fixes

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Labels of lazy-loaded data would incorrectly not be displayed in edit mode [ID 41189]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When you were editing a dashboard or a page or a panel of a low-code app, the labels of lazy-loaded data would incorrectly not be displayed.

#### Legacy Reporter would leak memory when requesting history alarms [ID 41247]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

Up to now, the legacy Reporter (SLASPConnection) would leak memory on every DataMiner Agent in the DMS when requesting history alarms.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Alarm table component: Time filter would be disregarded when fetching history alarms [ID 41249]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When an *Alarm table* component was configured to retrieve history alarms, it would incorrectly always retrieve all history alarms from the database, regardless of what was specified in the time filter.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Line & area chart component would incorrectly remain empty until it was resized [ID 41278]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

In some cases, a *Line & area chart* component would incorrectly remain empty until it was resized.

#### Low-Code Apps: Problem when multiple users would continually refresh a page with a number of queries [ID 41316]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When multiple users would open a page containing a number of queries and then continually refreshed the page within a time frame of 5 minutes, in some cases, the following GQI exception could be thrown:

`Maximum amount of concurrent sessions`

To prevent this exception from being thrown, the above-mentioned time frame has now been reduced to 1 minute.

#### Dashboards app: Not possible to generate a PDF report based on a dashboard containing empty components [ID 41317]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.1 -->

Up to now, it would incorrectly not be possible to generate a PDF report based on a dashboard that contained empty components.

#### Dashboards app - Button component: No pop-up message would appear when clicking a button linked to a parameter for which a warning message had been configured [ID 41344]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When you clicked the button of a *Button* component linked to a button parameter for which a warning message had been configured in the *protocol.xml* file, no pop-up message would appear.

For more information on how to configure a warning message to be displayed when users change a parameter value, see [Message element](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Message).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the Dashboards app, the *Button* component is available in soft launch, if the soft-launch option *ReportsAndDashboardsButton* is enabled.

#### Dashboards app: Variables and flows eligible to be dropped as data, filter or group would incorrectly not be highlighted in the 'Data' pane [ID 41367]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When, while editing a dashboard, you clicked a component's *Data*, *Filter* or *Group* button, variables and flows eligible to be dropped as data, filter or group would incorrectly not be highlighted in the *Data* pane.

#### Dashboards app - Column & bar chart component: Less axis labels were shown on PDF reports with a large paper size [ID 41408]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When you generated a PDF report of a dashboard containing a *Column & bar chart* component, up to now, the larger the paper size of the PDF, the fewer axis labels would incorrectly be shown on the chart.

#### Web API - GQI: Custom display values specified for cells containing Infinity or NaN values would incorrectly be overwritten [ID 41456]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] - FR 10.5.1 -->

When, in an ad hoc data source, a custom display value was specified for a cell containing a raw value equal to PositiveInfinity, NegativeInfinity or NaN, that custom display value would incorrectly be overwritten by "+Infinity", "-Infinity" or "NaN" respectively. As a result, the custom display value would never be shown in the client application.

From now on, when you specify a custom display value for a cell containing a raw value equal to PositiveInfinity, NegativeInfinity or NaN, that custom display value will no longer be overwritten. Also, when cells containing a raw value equal to PositiveInfinity, NegativeInfinity or NaN do not have a custom display value specified, then the following display values will be shown:

| Raw value | Display value |
|---|---|
| Double.PositiveInfinity | Infinity              |
| Double.NegativeInfinity | Infinity              |
| Double.NaN              | NaN                   |
| float.PositiveInfinity  | <span>&#8734;</span>  |
| float.NegativeInfinity  | -<span>&#8734;</span> |
| float.NaN               | Infinity              |

#### Web API: Not possible to initialize the file caches when using a dashboard gateway [ID 41559]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU10] - FR 10.5.1 [CU0] -->

When a dashboard gateway was used, up to now, it would not be possible to initialize the different file caches used by the web API, causing the following error to be thrown:

`The type initializer for 'Skyline.DataMiner.Web.Common.v1.Dashboards.DashboardsInterface' threw an exception.`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> From now on, when a dashboard gateway is used, all local KML or KMZ overlay files should be placed in the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Maps` folder of the DataMiner Agent. They should no longer be placed on the dashboard gateway.
