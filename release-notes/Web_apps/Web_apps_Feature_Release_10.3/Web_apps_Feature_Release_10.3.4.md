### Fixes

#### Dashboards app: Problem with width of PDF reports [ID_35531]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When a PDF report was generated via Automation or Scheduler, in some cases, its width would be set incorrectly.

Also, in some cases, the left and right padding of PDF reports generated via Automation, Scheduler and the Dashboards app itself would be missing.

#### Low-code apps: Sidebar would incorrectly be displayed when there was only one visible page [ID_35544]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

Up to now, whether the sidebar was displayed or not would incorrectly depend on the number of pages. From now on, it will depend on the number of visible pages. In other words, the sidebar will only be displayed when there are at least two visible pages.

#### Low-code apps: Clock components in a published low-code app would incorrectly only update when you moved the mouse [ID_35554]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

Clock components in a published low-code app would incorrectly only update when you moved the mouse.
