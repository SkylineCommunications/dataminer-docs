### Fixes

#### Low-Code Apps: Apps would become unresponsive after having been migrated [ID_37221]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 [CU1] -->
<!-- Not added to MR 10.4.0 -->

When users with *User-definable apps > View apps* permission opened a low-code app they were not allowed to edit, the app would become unresponsive after it had been migrated.
