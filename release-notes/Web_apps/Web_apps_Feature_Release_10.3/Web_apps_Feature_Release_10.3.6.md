### Fixes

#### Interactive Automation scripts: Problems with datetime component [ID_35682]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When an interactive Automation script was launched from a web app, the following issues could occur. These were all related to the datetime web component (*UIBlockType.Time*):

- When you clicked a date in the datetime picker, a changed value would already be returned to the script. From now on, the selected datetime value will not be returned to the script until you close the picker (either by double-clicking or by clicking *Done*).

- The datetime value that was returned to the script when the component lost focus could be incorrect.

- The focus loss detection would not always be accurate.

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps - Table component: Minimum pagesize would be used when exporting to a CSV file [ID_36012]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When exporting data from a table component to a CSV file, the minimum pagesize would be used. From now, the largest possible pagesize is used when exporting data from a table component to a CSV file.

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps: Component title could be made too large [ID_36021]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

In a custom component theme, for some fonts, the font size of the title could be set to a value higher than 36px, causing the component title to be larger than its container. Also, in some cases, the font size could incorrectly be set to 0px.

From now on, font sizes will have to be set to a value between 1px and 36px.
