### Enhancements

#### GQI: Enhanced behavior of aggregations applied on empty Elasticsearch tables [ID_36490]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.8 -->

Up to now, when an aggregation (min, max, average) was applied on an empty Elasticsearch table, the following exception would be thrown:

`Error trapped: Elastic returned unexpected value ''.`

From now on, when an aggregation (min, max, average) is applied on an empty Elasticsearch table, an empty cell will be returned instead.

Because of this change, the behavior of aggregations applied on all types of empty tables becomes more consistent:

| Type | RawValue | DisplayValue |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Avg/Min/Max/Median | null | "Not applicable" |
| (Distinct) Count   | 0    | 0                |
| Std dev/Percentile | null | "Not applicable" |
| Sum                | 0    | 0                |

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: Deleting components by pressing the DELETE button [ID_36753]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

You can now delete components by pressing the *DELETE* button on your keyboard.

1. In Edit mode, select the component(s) you want to delete.
1. Press the *DELETE* button.

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

#### Dashboards app: Problems with shared dashboards [ID_36752]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When you viewed a shared dashboard that you were not allowed to edit, in some cases, the dashboard would incorrectly be updated in the background, causing an error to be thrown.
