- Define transport types and configure custom free-text fields per transport type.
- Create, edit, delete, import, and export source and destination virtual signal groups.
- Organize endpoints in virtual signal groups by levels, with each level linked to a transport type.
- Assign virtual signal groups to categories to simplify source and destination selection in the Control Surface app.
- Provision and update endpoints and virtual signal groups at scale through CSV import/export and the MediaOps Live API.
