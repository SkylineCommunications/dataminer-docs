## Changes

### Enhancements

### Resource Studio: Improved feedback and visibility when deprecating or restoring multiple resources [ID 43804]

On the *Resources* page of the Resource Studio app, when a large number of resources are deprecated or restored, a loading indicator is now displayed, providing feedback on the action in progress. In addition, when you start an action to deprecate or restore multiple resources, you will now first be asked to confirm the action.

### Fixes

### MediaOps log files not included in SLLogCollector package [ID 43791]

When logging was collected using the SLLogCollector tool, the MediaOps logging was not included.
