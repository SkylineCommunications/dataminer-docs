## New features

#### Scheduling: Ability to pin time range quick picks [ID 43938]

On the *Job View* and *Resource View* pages of the Scheduling app, you can now pin quick picks for all users in the time range selector for the timeline.

## Changes

> [!NOTE]
> This release also includes the enhancements and fixes of the 1.4.x releases.

### Enhancements

#### Resource Studio: Improved feedback and visibility when deprecating or restoring multiple resources [ID 43804]

On the *Resources* page of the Resource Studio app, when a large number of resources are deprecated or restored, a loading indicator is now displayed, providing feedback on the action in progress. In addition, when you start an action to deprecate or restore multiple resources, you will now first be asked to confirm the action.

#### Message when user has insufficient rights [ID 43942]

When users do not have the necessary permissions to execute a certain action, a clear message will now be shown to inform them of this. Previously, only a stack trace was shown.

### Fixes

#### Scheduling: Action buttons missing in Edit Job panel after reverting job status to Tentative [ID 43808]

When the status of a job was reverted from Confirmed to Tentative, it could occur that action buttons for the job were no longer displayed in the Edit Job panel.

#### Scheduler: Lock on job not removed after duplication [ID 43915]

When a locked job was duplicated, the user who had a lock on the original job also had a lock on the duplicated job, which should not be the case and was not clear to the user. This could cause confusion when someone else tried to edit the duplicated job.
