- GQI_metrics\<TimeStamp>.txt
- Web_web\<TimeStamp>.log
- Web_web.clientmetric\<TimeStamp>.log

#### 26 April 2024 - Fix - SupportAssistant 1.6.9 - Inconsistent cloud endpoint detection failures [ID 39514]

An issue has been resolved that could make features like Remote Log Collection and data offloads for proactive support inconsistently fail.

#### 17 November 2023 - Enhancement - SupportAssistant 1.5.3 - Potential memory leak [ID 37843]

When SupportAssistant 1.5.2 or older was installed, a memory and disk space leak could occur for systems that were not connected to dataminer.services or for systems with an invalid dataminer.services connection configuration or setup. This has now been resolved.

#### 8 November 2023 - Enhancement - SupportAssistant 1.5.2 [ID 37797]

Several dependencies have been updated.

#### 2 November 2023 - Fix - SupportAssistant 1.5.1 - Issue when hosting server of DataMiner CloudGateway had more than one NIC [ID 37770]

When SupportAssistant 1.5.1 or earlier was used, it could occur that remote log collection failed when uploading the package in case the CloudGateway module was installed on a server with more than one network interface (NIC). This has now been resolved.

Make sure to also install DataMiner CloudGateway 2.12.3 to make use of this fix.

#### 11 August 2023 - Enhancement - SupportAssistant 1.5.0 - Upgrade to .NET 6 [ID 37099]

DataMiner SupportAssistant has been upgraded to .NET 6, so that it no longer depends on .NET 5. **Make sure .NET 6 is installed** before you upgrade to this version.

#### 28 June 2023 - Enhancement - SupportAssistant 1.4.0 - Improved offloading of reports and notifications [ID 36726]

To improve the maintenance and support experience, offloading of reports and notifications generated by SLWatchDog to dataminer.services is now implemented in a different manner.

Because of this, you will need to upgrade to SupportAssistant 1.4.0 in order to keep this feature available, as the previous implementation (available since SupportAssistant 1.3.1) is now obsolete.

#### 15 May 2023 - Enhancement - SupportAssistant 1.3.3 - Connection improvements [ID 36419]

A retry mechanism has been implemented to fetch the cloud endpoint. If after the retries, still no cloud endpoint can be received, the module will fall back to trying to access dataminer.services directly. If this is not possible, the module will log the failed actions.

#### 3 May 2023 - Fix - SupportAssistant 1.3.2 - Fixed incorrect timeout for Remote Log Collection uploads [ID 36311]

An issue has been resolved where Remote Log Collection could incorrectly time out after 100 seconds of uploading.

#### 21 April 2023 - Enhancements - SupportAssistant 1.3.1 - General improvements and offloading of reports and notifications [ID 35482] [ID 35485] [ID 35492] [ID 35559] [ID 35756] [ID 36152] [ID 36201]

Changes have been implemented in DataMiner SupportAssistant to improve its general stability.

In addition, this DxM now takes care of offloading reports and notifications generated by SLWatchDog to dataminer.services to improve the maintenance and support experience.

You can disable the offloading of reports and notifications by overriding the entries from *FileWatcherOptions:Configs* in the app settings with an empty array. To do so, on each server where DataMiner SupportAssistant is installed, in the folder `C:\Program Files\Skyline Communications\DataMiner SupportAssistant`, create or adjust the override *appsettings.custom.json* with the following contents:

```json
{
   "FileWatcherOptions": {
      "Configs": []
   }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - At present, this feature runs in parallel with the old method of offloading via an SMTP server. This old method of offloading cannot yet be disabled.
> - For this feature to work, traffic must be allowed via port 5100 on the internal network, and DataMiner CloudGateway 2.10.0 or higher must be installed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you disable offloading of reports and notifications via DataMiner SupportAssistant, Skyline will not be able to provide maintenance and support.

#### 24 January 2023 - Fix - SupportAssistant 1.2.1 - Log Collector continuously triggered after failing to generate files [ID 35457]

In some rare cases, if invalid arguments were passed to the Log Collector so that it could not generate files, it could occur that the Log Collector kept getting triggered by the SupportAssistant DxM. Now the SupportAssistant will stop after a specific number of attempts.

This fix is included in Cloud Pack 2.8.5.

#### 10 January 2023 - Enhancement - DataMiner SupportAssistant 1.2.0 - Various stability improvements [ID 35349]

Various general stability improvements have been implemented. In addition, eventing has been added to dataminer.services, so that the Skyline Support Team can follow up on the status of remote log collection.

This enhancement is included in Cloud Pack 2.8.4.

#### 19 December 2022 - Fix - SupportAssistant 1.1.1 - Log collection triggered too often [ID 35158]

A problem with the SupportAssistant could cause the Log Collector to be triggered again and again, which could make it use up a lot of disk space.

This fix is included in Cloud Pack 2.8.3.

#### 8 December 2022 - New feature - SupportAssistant 1.1.0 - Remote Log Collection [ID 34681] [ID 34875] [ID 34928] [ID 34934] [ID 34954] [ID 34992]

This feature also requires Cloud Gateway 2.10.0 or higher.

A new DataMiner Cloud Pack 2.8.2 has been released, which enables the [Remote Log Collection](xref:RemoteLogCollection) feature. The DataMiner Cloud Pack can be found on [DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/downloads/).

With remote log collection, the packages generated by the [Log Collector tool](xref:SLLogCollector) are automatically transferred to secure storage in the cloud. This gives the experts at Skyline Communications immediate access to these packages, so that they can collect DataMiner log and memory dump files independently, increasing efficiency of investigations.
