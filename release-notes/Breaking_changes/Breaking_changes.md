# Breaking changes

The following breaking changes have been introduced in recent DataMiner releases, or are planned for upcoming releases.

| Release note ID | Release version(s) | Description |
|--|--|--|
| [35837](xref:Web_apps_Feature_Release_10.3.5#dashboards-app--low-code-apps-new-way-to-link-components-to-feeds-id_35837) | DataMiner 10.4.0/10.3.5 | Up to now, when you linked a script parameter to the *From* or *Till* box of a time range feed, the feed would pass a datetime value in string format to the script. That string value was not in an ISO format and did not contain any information about the time zone. From now on, the feed will send a UTC timestamp in milliseconds instead. Scripts that expect to receive a string value will need to be modified. |
| [35802](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.3.5#problem-with-slnet-when-serializing-a-modelhost-error-id_35802) | DataMiner 10.3.0 CU2/10.3.5 | The `Exception` field had to be removed from the `ManagerStoreError` class. |
| [35772](xref:Web_apps_Feature_Release_10.3.5#breaking-change-one-single-authentication-app-for-all-web-apps-id_35772-id_35896) | DataMiner 10.4.0/10.3.5 | When using external authentication via SAML, all existing `AssertionConsumerService` elements specified in the `spMetadata.xml` file can now be replaced by one single element. |
| [33515 33616 33625 33659](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.3.4#slxml-no-longer-used-to-read-out-element-data-id_33515-id_33616-id_33625-id_33659) | DataMiner 10.4.0/10.3.4 | SLXML will no longer be used to read out *Element.xml* files, *ElementData.xml* files, *EPMConfig.xml* files, *Description.xml* files and *Ports.xml* files. |
| [35640](xref:Web_apps_Feature_Release_10.3.4#gqi-raw-datetime-values-will-now-be-converted-to-utc-id_35640) | DataMiner 10.4.0/10.3.4 | When, in an ad hoc data source or a query operation, a datetime value is not in UTC format, an exception will now be thrown. |
| [35504](xref:Web_apps_Feature_Release_10.3.4#web-apps---interactive-automation-scripts-components-in-a-row-following-a-component-with-a-row-span-greater-than-1-would-not-be-positioned-correctly-id_35504) | DataMiner 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1]/10.3.4 | If, in an interactive Automation script designed to be executed in a web app, the column property was altered to position a component at a specific spot, because of this fix, the component in question will no longer be displayed. It will be hidden by the component of which the row span is greater than 1. The component can be made visible again by changing the column property. |
| [35172](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.3.3#dataminer-object-model-new-clientreadonly-and-allowmultiplesections-properties-id_35172) | DataMiner 10.3.0/10.3.3 | Previously, it was possible to add multiple sections without having to set any property. After upgrading to DataMiner 10.3.3/10.3.0, you will need to update any existing `DomDefinitions` with multiple `Sections`. |
| [34895](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.3.1#breaking-change---dashboards-app--low-code-apps---gqi-certain-cell-values-in-a-gqi-query-result-will-no-longer-include-the-object-type-id_34895) | DataMiner 10.2.0 [CU1]/10.3.1 | Previously, cell values of GQI result rows for DomInstanceIds, DomDefinitionIds, ProfileInstanceIds, and ProfileDefinitionIds contained both the display value of the GUID and the object type. Now only the display value of the GUID is used as the cell value. |
| [34856](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.3.2#breaking-change-capacity-property-will-no-longer-be-initialized-on-new-resources-id_34856) | DataMiner 10.3.0/10.3.2 | Capacity property will no longer be initialized on new Resources |
| [33916](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.2.9#azure-active-directory-secret-expiry-noticeserrors-id_33916) | DataMiner 10.3.0/10.2.9 | Improvements have been implemented to the Azure AD configuration that require a manual change to the configuration to be fully functional. Refer to the [release notes](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.2.9#azure-active-directory-secret-expiry-noticeserrors-id_33916) for detailed info. |
| [33836](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.2.9#breaking-change-removing-a-resource-or-resourcepool-object-will-now-always-require-a-valid-id-id_33836) | DataMiner 10.3.0/10.2.9 | It is no longer possible to delete Resource and ResourcePool objects in a filtered way by passing an incomplete object to the associated remove method of the ResourceManagerHelper. |
| [33819](xref:SRM_1.2.27#improved-resource-orchestration-wizard-id_33819) | SRM 1.2.27 | The input parameters of the resource orchestration wizard have changed. |
| [33294](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.2.6#breaking-change-problem-when-filtering-a-table-with-a-foreign-key-relation-to-a-remote-table-using-a-filter-that-contained-a-value-from-the-remote-table-id_33294) | DataMiner 10.1.0 [CU15]/10.2.0 [CU3]/10.2.6 | When you filter a table on the value of a remote column and the remote table is empty, the table value filtering will now return an empty result set. Previously, all rows of the local table were returned, and actual filtering only happened as soon as the remote table had at least one row. |
| [33306](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.2.7#new-subscript-option-extendederrorinfo-id_33306) | DataMiner 10.3.0/10.2.7 | DataMiner Automation will now throw a different error when an element is not running, which may affect existing scripts. |
| [32702](xref:SRM_1.2.23#breaking-change-interface-profile-parameters-now-set-on-resource-even-when-no-profile-instance-is-set-id_32702) | SRM 1.2.23 | When the initial configuration is applied to a resource, parameter values set on an interface will now be included even when no profile instance was set. |
| [32654](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.2.4#modified-absolutequarantinepriority-behavior-and-several-new-srm-features-id_32654) | DataMiner 10.3.0/10.2.4 | The behavior of the *AbsoluteQuarantinePriority* property has been modified. Refer to the [release notes](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.2.4#modified-absolutequarantinepriority-behavior-and-several-new-srm-features-id_32654) for details. |
| [32333](xref:SRM_1.2.22#automatic-path-selection-in-case-no-function-is-passed-in-silent-booking-id_32333) | SRM 1.2.22 | A path is now automatically selected even when no function is passed to the CreateNewBooking method, unless *Auto Select Resource* is set to *False*. |
| [31746](xref:SRM_1.2.21#breaking-change-srm_customproperty-deprecated-id_31746) | SRM 1.2.21 | The script *SRM_CustomProperty* is now deprecated, and the methods *AddOrUpdateCustomProperty* and *TryAddOrUpdateCustomProperty* are now obsolete. |
| [31675](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.2.2#breaking-change-end-of-internet-explorer-support-for-dataminer-web-apps-id_31675) | DataMiner 10.2.0/10.2.2 | DataMiner web apps can no longer be used with Internet Explorer. See [End of Internet Explorer support for DataMiner web apps](https://community.dataminer.services/end-of-internet-explorer-support-for-dataminer-web-apps/). |
| [31534](xref:SRM_1.2.20#breaking-change-profile-instance-now-mandatory-if-profile-definition-has-parameters-to-configure-id_31534) | SRM 1.2.20 | The Booking Wizard no longer allows booking creation if the used function profile definition has parameters to configure while there are no profile instances in the system for the function. |
| [31126](xref:SRM_1.2.19#transport-resources-assigned-to-main-booking-id_31126) | SRM 1.2.19 | When no contributing transport booking was available, transport resources could be assigned to the main booking and the path info was added in a property of the main booking. As this is no longer a valid use case, this behavior has been removed. |
| [31011](xref:SRM_1.2.18#profile-instance-now-optional-for-node-interfaces-of-transport-service-definition-id_31011) | SRM 1.2.18 | The *IsProfileInstanceOptional* property of each service definition node will now always be set to true for contributing bookings using a custom path. Existing custom transport service definitions and the corresponding bookings need to be updated. |
| [30913](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.1.11#breaking-change-dataminer-installer-will-only-enable-icmp-and-http-ports-80--8004-id_30913) | DataMiner 10.1.0 [CU8]/10.1.11 | DataMiner installer will now only enable ICMP and HTTP ports 80 & 8004. Other ports must be enabled manually if necessary. See Configuring the IP network ports. |
| [30399](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.1.10#getting-and-setting-the-value-of-a-table-column-parameter-id_30399) | DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.10 | Mobile Gateway: Setting or getting parameter values via text message is no longer possible with parameter names containing pipe characters. |
| [30104](xref:SRM_1.2.14#improvement-to-service-definitions-with-custom-dijkstra-contributing-booking-id_30104) | SRM 1.2.14 | When a custom Dijkstra contributing booking is added, the *IsProfileInstanceOptional* property of each service definition node is now set to true. Existing custom transport service definitions and the corresponding bookings need to be updated. |
| [28684](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.1.10#improved-average-trending-id_28684) | DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.10 | Average trending is now calculated differently. For more information, see Average trending calculation. |
| [29545](xref:SRM_1.2.12#breaking-change-logging-of-srm-manager-displayed-for-other-bookings-id_29545) | SRM 1.2.12 | In SRM scripts, instead of initializing a new Logger instance, you should now use SrmLogHandler.Create (in Skyline.DataMiner.Library.Solutions.SRM.Logging). |
| [29453](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.1.6#breaking-change-web-services-api-v0-is-now-disabled-by-default-id_29453) | DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.6 | The Web Services v0 interface is now considered obsolete and is disabled by default. An option is available to enable the interface again if necessary. However, if a DMA is connected to dataminer.services, the v0 interface cannot be used. |
| [29430](xref:SRM_1.2.12#different-resource-elements-for-functions-that-have-same-resource-assigned-in-booking-id_29430) | SRM 1.2.12 | Previously, when functions had the same resource assigned within a booking, the corresponding resource element was added in the booking service once. Now, when the node labels of the service definition are used as the element alias for the resource elements, for each function a resource element is added in the booking service. |
| [29306](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.1.5#enhanced-performance-by-implementing-iserializable-on-the-reservationinstance-class-using-protocol-buffer-serialization-id_29306) | DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.5 | SRM changes:<br>- The Children and Parent property of a ReservationInstance will no longer be serialized between client and server. When the ResourceManagerHelper is used, backwards compatibility is implemented. However, if you use the messages yourself and receive ResourceManagerEventMessages via subscriptions (which is NOT recommended), you will need to call the GetStitched method on the ReservationInstance class. Saving ReservationInstances with a parent or child instance using messages may also cause issues.<br>- When the SetReservationInstances method is called on the ResourceManagerHelper, a random ID will now be assigned before the instances are saved to the server. This could be an issue if scripts expect the ID to be empty and try to reuse the object. |
| [29095](xref:SRM_1.2.11#breaking-change-quarantining-a-contributing-booking-now-affects-the-main-booking-id_29095) | SRM 1.2.11 | Assigning a quarantined contributing resource to a booking is no longer possible. |
| [28912](xref:SRM_1.2.11#breaking-change-bookings-that-failed-to-start-now-set-to-failed-id_28912) | SRM 1.2.11 | The custom *Booking Start Failure* script, if present, needs to be updated in accordance with the *SRM_BookingStartFailureTemplate* script. |
| [28392](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.1.2#dataminer-object-model-id_28096id_28392id_28460) | DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.2 | DefaultJobSectionDefinition extensions have been changed so they do not apply to an ISectionContainer but only to a Job. This is backwards compatible on a syntax level, but the code using these extensions will have to be recompiled using the updated SLNetTypes.dll. |
| [26006](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.0.9#breaking-change---web-services-api-v1-new-and-updated-methods-to-manage-job-data-id_26006) | DataMiner 10.1.0/10.0.9 | Web Services API v1: Job management methods have been modified. |
| [25216](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.0.5#breaking-change---dashboards-app-cpe-feed-component-now-uses-element-data-feed-id_25216) | DataMiner 10.1.0/10.0.5 | Dashboards: CPE component now has to be configured with a feed instead of through the component settings. |

The following breaking changes were introduced to features that were still in soft launch at the time:

| Release note ID | Release version(s) | Description |
|--|--|--|
| 31548 | 10.3.0/10.2.1 | DCF interface properties are no longer available as columns of the DCF interfaces GQI data source. Instead they are now available as a separate GQI data source, which can be joined with the DCF interfaces data source based on the *Interface ID* column. |
| 30155 | 10.2.0/10.1.8 | Changes to the query filter, which requires the ReportsAndDashboardsPTP soft-launch option, will cause the column order, column sizes, and sorting to be reset to the default values for all GQI tables. |
| 26152 | 10.1.0/10.0.9 | Dashboards: Generic Query Interface queries can no longer contain a ColumnInfo object. Instead these now contain the name of the column. |
