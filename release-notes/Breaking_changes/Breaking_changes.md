|--|--|--|
| [RN 44136](xref:Web_apps_Feature_Release_10.6.1#annotations-are-now-end-of-life-id-44136) | DataMiner 10.5.0 [CU10]/10.6.1 | In web apps, annotations will no longer work when connected to a DataMiner Agent running main release version 10.6.0 or feature release version 10.6.1 (or above).<br>Also, when connected to a DataMiner Agent running main release version 10.6.0 or feature release version 10.6.1 (or above), the following Web Services API methods (v1) will return an error: GetAnnotationsLinkForElement, GetAnnotationsLinkForService, and GetAnnotationsLinkForView. |
| [RN 43929](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.6.1#unicode-string-values-will-now-be-saved-correctly-in-non-unicode-elements-id-43929) |  DataMiner 10.6.0/10.6.1 | In a Unicode connector, the `Interprete.Value` of string parameters with a fixed length will be considered a Unicode value, unless it is in 0x format. Values of parameters with `Interprete.RawType` set to "Numeric Text" and `Interprete.Type` set to "double" will be considered ASCII values, even when the element is using a Unicode connector.<br>From now on, serial commands with `ascii="true"` will only be applied to string parameters of which `Interprete.Value` does not contain a value in 0x format. Up to now, `ascii="true"` would be applied to all parameters in a serial command. |
| [43864](xref:Web_apps_Feature_Release_10.5.12#dashboardslow-code-apps-html-code-on-read-only-dom-forms-will-no-longer-be-interpreted-id-43864) | DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU21]/10.5.0 [CU9]/10.5.12 | From now on, when set to read-only, a *Form* component will display all HTML code as code. |

| [35956](xref:SRM_1.2.31) | SRM 1.2.31 | The logic to assign resources for unmapped nodes has been modified so that it is similar to the logic when creating a new booking. |
| [35837](xref:Web_apps_Feature_Release_10.3.5#dashboards-app--low-code-apps-new-way-to-link-components-to-feeds-id-35837) | DataMiner 10.4.0/10.3.5 | Up to now, when you linked a script parameter to the *From* or *Till* box of a time range feed, the feed would pass a datetime value in string format to the script. That string value was not in an ISO format and did not contain any information about the time zone. From now on, the feed will send a UTC timestamp in milliseconds instead. Scripts that expect to receive a string value will need to be modified. |

Now, when the node labels of the service definition are used as the element alias for the resource elements, for each function a resource element is added in the booking service. |
| [29306](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.1.5#enhanced-performance-by-implementing-iserializable-on-the-reservationinstance-class-using-protocol-buffer-serialization-id-29306) | DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.5 | SRM changes:<br>- The Children and Parent property of a ReservationInstance will no longer be serialized between client and server. When the ResourceManagerHelper is used, backwards compatibility is implemented. However, if you use the messages yourself and receive ResourceManagerEventMessages via subscriptions (which is NOT recommended), you will need to call the GetStitched method on the ReservationInstance class. Saving ReservationInstances with a parent or child instance using messages may also cause issues.<br>- When the SetReservationInstances method is called on the ResourceManagerHelper, a random ID will now be assigned before the instances are saved to the server. This could be an issue if scripts expect the ID to be empty and try to reuse the object. |
| [29095](xref:SRM_1.2.11#breaking-change-quarantining-a-contributing-booking-now-affects-the-main-booking-id-29095) | SRM 1.2.11 | Assigning a quarantined contributing resource to a booking is no longer possible. |

This is backwards compatible on a syntax level, but the code using these extensions will have to be recompiled using the updated SLNetTypes.dll. |
| [26006](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.0.9#breaking-change---web-services-api-v1-new-and-updated-methods-to-manage-job-data-id-26006) | DataMiner 10.1.0/10.0.9 | Web Services API v1: Job management methods have been modified. |

The following breaking changes were introduced to features that were still in soft launch at the time:

| Release note ID | Release version(s) | Description |
|--|--|--|
| 31548 | 10.3.0/10.2.1 | DCF interface properties are no longer available as columns of the DCF interfaces GQI data source. Instead they are now available as a separate GQI data source, which can be joined with the DCF interfaces data source based on the *Interface ID* column. |
| 30155 | 10.2.0/10.1.8 | Changes to the query filter, which requires the ReportsAndDashboardsPTP soft-launch option, will cause the column order, column sizes, and sorting to be reset to the default values for all GQI tables. |
| 26152 | 10.1.0/10.0.9 | Dashboards: Generic Query Interface queries can no longer contain a ColumnInfo object. Instead these now contain the name of the column. |
