## Fixes

#### Ticket type enum field display issue [ID 45143]

Previously, UI handling for adding ticket type fields was refactored to make the code cleaner and easier to maintain. However, this change introduced an issue when an enum field was followed by another field. The UI did not properly clean up previous fields before adding enum options, which caused display issues.

This issue has now been resolved, restoring the correct behavior while keeping the improved code structure.
