# EPM 6.1.6 I-DOCSIS - Preview

## New features

#### New 'Other DOCSIS' KPI [ID_34346]

New aggregation operations were added to the hub, market, network, CCAP, service group, and node segment levels to register the number of CMs with a DOCSIS version other than DOCSIS 2.0, DOCSIS 3.0, or DOCSIS 3.1. The resulting KPI is displayed in the *Other DOCSIS* column.

#### Option to show/hide PNM on Node Segment map [ID_34387]

Both on the *Configuration* page of the Skyline EPM Platform element and in the front-end EPM visual overview, a toggle button is now available that can be used to show or hide the PNM layers on the Node Segment map.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Maps with PNM layer moved to Node Segment layer [ID_34390]

The maps implementation with PNM layer has been moved from the Service Group layer to the Node Segment layer. Maps now retrieve data directly from the CCAP/collector elements instead of the front end.

#### Provisioning now by default enabled after back end restart [ID_34480]

When the back end was restarted, up to now, provisioning was disabled by default. Now it will be enabled by default. The Provisioning parameter is now also available on the Configuration page in Visual Overview.

#### Support for maps on passive levels [ID_35022]

Maps are now supported on the node segment, node, amplifier, and tap levels of the EPM topology.

#### Multi-threaded timer removed [ID_35034]

The CCAP Platform connectors will no longer use a multi-threaded timer to poll the DOCSIS version of each cable modem.

Because of this, a number of other changes have been implemented:

- The DOCSIS version column has been removed from the Cable Modems table, and aggregating actions based on this column have been moved to the Generic CM Collector connector. The column is now also no longer exported to the cable modem EC file.

- Alarm monitoring is now disabled on all columns of the CM QAM DS Channels table, CM QAM US Channels table, and Cable Modem table.

- QAction 7600, associated with the polling of the DOCSIS version of each cable modem available in the system, has been removed.

- The Threadpool page has been removed along with all its parameters, as these were associated with the multi-threaded timer.

### Fixes

#### Issues related to alarm in EPM Platform visual overview [ID_34449]

The following issues related to alarms could occur in the EPM Platform visual overview:

- On the Service Group level, the alarm tab in the EPM Platform visual overview did not show any alarms.
- Alarm statistics associated with the Service Group level could be incorrect.
- The alarm coloring of shapes could also be incorrect (e.g. minor alarms displayed with a green color instead of the correct light-blue color).

#### Arris E6000 CCAP Platform - Empty Node Segment table [ID_34461]

Because of an incorrect condition check, it could occur that the Node Segment table of the Arris CCAP connector did not get filled in. In addition, the export of the Node Segment EC file was not performed.

#### Exceptions thrown by CM Collector [ID_34472]

If the Generic DOCSIS CM Collector connector could not find the Passive Relation\\EP folder while parsing the SG file, an exception could be thrown.

#### Parameters based on system description not filled in in CCAP table [ID_34556]

In the CCAP table, it could occur that parameters based on the system description were not filled in.

#### QAM DS Channel: Missing decimals in MER and packet ratio columns [ID_34560]

Up to now, the MER and packet ratio columns for the QAM DS Channel did not show any decimals even when decimals were available for a particular KPI.

#### Incorrect DS/US Channel Utilization in Node Segment overview [ID_34623]

In the Node Segment overview, it could occur that the DS Channel Utilization showed the value for the US Channel Utilization and vice versa.

#### Percentage Ping OK value above 100% [ID_34726]

When the Number Ping OK parameter had a value larger than the number of CMs, the Percentage Ping OK parameter indicated a value above 100%. The percentage calculation has now been adjusted to prevent this. Exceptional cases like this will now be returned as -1 (N/A). Exception values were added to both the Percentage Ping OK and Percentage Ping Unreachable parameters in the amplifier and node overview tables.

#### Link to dashboard does not apply filter [ID_35207]

When a user clicked the dashboard icon, this opened a dashboard without applying a filter. Now a filter has been included in the dashboard link.
