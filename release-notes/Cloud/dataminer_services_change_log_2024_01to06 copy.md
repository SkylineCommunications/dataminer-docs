# dataminer.services change log - 2024 (January-June)

This change log can help you trace when specific features and changes became available on the dataminer.services platform in 2024, from January to June.

> [!NOTE]
> Many features on dataminer.services are dependent on DxMs. You can find the change logs for these under [DxM release notes](xref:DxM_RNs_index).

#### 24 June 2024 - Fix - Catalog - Problem looking up item without versions [ID 40009]

Up to now, if a user searched for a public Catalog item without versions, it could occur that the correct result could not be displayed even if the user was a member of the appropriate organization to view the item.

#### 19 June 2024 - Fix - Remote Access and Live Sharing connection failing when DMA went offline [ID 39983]

Up to now, if the connected DMA that was used to serve the web API requests for Remote Access or Live Sharing went offline, e.g. when switching in a Failover setup, the connection did not switch to another online DMA in the DMS. Instead it kept trying to connect to the initial DMA even though it was offline, causing Remote Access or Live Sharing not to work until the browser cookies were cleared. This issue has now been resolved. Automatic login issues caused by this same issue have also been resolved.

#### 19 June 2024 - Fix - Remote access automatic login showed error page when failing [ID 39982]

When the automatic login with a user's linked DataMiner account failed, up to now a blue error page was shown displaying that there was an unexpected error. Now, the login page will be shown instead, where users can manually log in as a fallback.

#### 19 June 2024 - Fix - Catalog - Email of user not shown in user menu [ID 39960]

It could occur that the user's email could not be shown in the user menu of the Catalog. This issue has been resolved.

#### 19 June 2024 - Fix - Catalog - Selected organization not remembered across dataminer.services apps or after reloading the Catalog [ID 39913]

If an organization was selected in the Catalog app, it could occur that this selection was not remembered when the app was reloaded, and a different organization was selected again (usually, the first organization alphabetically). Similarly, when you switched from one dataminer.services app to another, the organization selection was not remembered.

Now the organization selection will be correctly saved and shared across apps or across app reloads.

#### 19 June 2024 - Enhancement - Catalog - Register catalog item moved to user menu [ID 39906]

The button to open the form in order to register a catalog item has been moved from the header to the user menu.

> [!NOTE]
> To be able to see the button, you need to be a member of at least one organization.

#### 19 June 2024 - Enhancement - Catalog - Documentation link shown after Catalog item is registered [ID 39904]

â€‹After registering an item, users will now get a link to the documentation guiding them to the next step, i.e. uploading a version.

From now on, if Remote Access to the web apps is enabled, this allows access to the entire folder `/Documents/`, so that it is possible to access the documents available in Cube. Previously, only the `/Documents/DMA_COMMON_DOCUMENTS/` folder was accessible.

#### 10 June 2024 - Fix - Link to terms and conditions not working [ID 39895]

The link to the terms and conditions, displayed among others when a DaaS system was registered and an Agent was connected to dataminer.services, did not work correctly. This has now been resolved.

#### 10 June 2024 - Enhancement - Admin - 'Nodes' page renamed to 'DxMs' [ID 39874]

In the Admin app, the *Nodes* page has been renamed to *DxMs* to be more in line with the actual functionality of the page.

#### 10 June 2024 - Fix - Admin - Zero credits not showing [ID 39866]

On the Admin organization overview page, it was not possible to see how many credits were left in case you had zero credits. Now the number of available credits will always be displayed, even if this is zero.

When you deploy a DaaS system, you will now be asked to confirm your password before can deploy the system.

#### 10 June 2024 - Fix - Admin - Opening in desktop app not working [ID 39838]

On the overview page of a DMS in the Admin app, the *Open in desktop app* button did not work correctly. Now Cube will correctly be opened when this button is clicked.

#### 7 June 2024 - Enhancement - ChatOps - Possibility to fetch the dataminer.services organization ID & DMS ID in Automation [ID 39878]

A new version (1.2.4) of [the DcpChatIntegrationHelper NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skyline.DataMiner.DcpChatIntegrationHelper) has been released, which allows you to fetch the dataminer.services organization ID and DMS ID.

These IDs, which had to be hardcoded before, can now be used for the buttons added in Adaptive Cards.

You can fetch them using the following example:

````cs
var chatIntegrationHelper = new ChatIntegrationHelperBuilder().Build();
try
{
  var dmsIdentity = chatIntegrationHelper.GetDataMinerServicesDmsIdentity();
  var organizationId = dmsIdentity.OrganizationId;
  var dmsId = dmsIdentity.DmsId;
}
finally
{
  chatIntegrationHelper?.Dispose();
}
````

The [ChatOps example scripts on GitHub](https://github.com/SkylineCommunications/ChatOps-Extensions) have been updated accordingly.

#### 30 May 2024 - Enhancement - Enable access to more web app folders via Remote Access [ID 39812]

Caching for the index page has been disabled for all dataminer.services apps, so that users will now always get the latest index page. As a result of this, the apps will be guaranteed to always have the latest code, since everything in the apps resolves to the index page.

A new version of (1.2.3) [the DcpChatIntegrationHelper NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skyline.DataMiner.DcpChatIntegrationHelper) has also been released, which allows you to skip the confirmation on custom buttons in Adaptive Cards.
