# dataminer.services change log - 2025

The dataminer.services platform gets updated continuously. This change log can help you trace when specific features and changes have become available in 2025.

> [!NOTE]
> Many features on dataminer.services are dependent on DxMs. You can find the change logs for these under [DxM release notes](xref:DxM_RNs_index).

### 21 October 2025 - Fix - Sharing - Not possible to share a dashboard with a comma in its name

Previously, when a user shared a dashboard that had a comma in its name, the Sharing app removed the comma and all characters that followed it. This caused the share not to be found on dataminer.services, which effectively made it impossible to share a dashboard with a comma in its name. This issue has been resolved, so such dashboards can now be shared.

### 9 October 2025 - Fix - Status - Incorrect spacing incident descriptions

Previously, if descriptions for incidents contained tabs or new lines, these were not shown. Now the text will be shown with correct spacing.

### 1 October 2025 - Enhancement - Usage - STaaS usage billing

Starting from 1 October 2025, automatic monthly billing will be implemented for STaaS. On the first day of each month, the expended DataMiner credits for the previous month's STaaS usage will be subtracted from the organization's balance. This billing will take effect retroactively, going as far back as April 2024.

In case an organization does not have sufficient DataMiner credits, their balance will go negative, and it will need to be topped up as soon as possible. Organizations with a negative balance will not be able to deploy new DaaS systems.

### 30 September 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Ranges now show creation date instead of last modified date

In the Catalog app, item ranges will now show their creation date instead of the date when they were last modified.

### 21 September 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Enhanced searching capabilities

In the Catalog app, a more advanced search has been implemented with a ranking system. Users should now be able to find more relevant items when searching on terms that are not necessarily in the display name of the item.

Additionally, when a tag on a Catalog item is clicked, that tag will be used as a filter to find other items with the same tag.

### 21 September 2025 - New feature - Admin - Integrated support

The Admin app now has a support page where users that are part of a verified organization can see and create tickets.

### 11 September 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Custom icons

It is now possible to apply custom icons to your Catalog items using the [Key Catalog API](https://catalogapi-prod.cca-prod.aks.westeurope.dataminer.services/swagger/index.html?urls.primaryName=Key+Catalog+API+v3.0).

### 10 September 2025 - New feature - Catalog - Improved home page

The Catalog app now has a new home page with a carousel and trending tab.

### 2 September 2025 - Enhancement - dataminer.services - Ask support button

From now on, users can ask for support by clicking the **?** button next to the user icon.

### 1 September 2025 - Enhancement - Remote Access - Support remote access to the Assistant web app

From now on, the Assistant web app can be accessed remotely.

### 29 August 2025 - Enhancement - dataminer.services - Status routes now use the shared header bar

In any dataminer.services application, accessing status routes such as /404, /error, or /success will now display the appropriate status page along with the shared header bar.

### 29 August 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Legacy URL support for connectors has been discontinued

In the Catalog app, legacy connector URLs such as catalog.dataminer.services/result/driver/{:id} are no longer supported. Accessing these endpoints will now redirect users to a 404 error page.

### 26 August 2025 - Enhancement - Remote Access - Support for video thumbnails when remotely accessing Cube

From now on, video thumbnails will be displayed when DataMiner Cube is accessed remotely.

### 18 August 2025 - Enhancement - Admin - Unmanaged objects usage visibility and export possibility

In the Admin app, the usage for unmanaged objects will now be displayed if you are using at least DataMiner 10.5.9/10.6.0 and DataMiner SupportAssistant 1.7.3. The data will also be available for export.

### 07 August 2025 - Enhancement - Version description now supports Markdown

If you use Markdown in the description of item versions, this will now be parsed to HTML just like for the main item description. The same syntax supported in the item description is also supported in the version description.

### 05 August 2025 - Enhancement - DaaS systems can now use the URL of soft-deleted systems

It is now supported to create a DaaS system with a URL that is used by a system that is still in the soft-deleted state.

### 05 August 2025 - New feature - Admin - DMS usage overview

As an owner or administrator of a DMS, you can now see the usage of your system on the *Usage* page for the DMS in question in the Admin app.

### 16 July 2025 - Enhancement - Startup and upgrade progress displayed when remotely accessing Cube

From now on, if you remotely access the Cube desktop app while the DataMiner System is starting up or while an upgrade is in progress, the progress will be displayed instead of an error. Upgrading the DataMiner System while remotely accessing Cube will also no longer disconnect the session but will instead show the upgrade progress.

### 15 July 2025 - Fix - Remote Access & Live Sharing - Authentication issue redirecting to a blue error page

In some cases, users that tried to sign in could be redirected to a blue error page displaying `An error occurred while processing your request`. This issue has been resolved.

### 15 July 2025 - Enhancement - Remote Access & Live Sharing - Stability and performance improvements

Stability and performance improvements have been implemented, which will make the remote access features more stable.

### 30 June 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Grid view rendered incorrectly

On the browse page of the Catalog, if you switched from row view to grid view, it could occur that only one column was used.

### 30 June 2025 - Fix - Authentication issues

If an authentication renewal message was processed incorrectly, it could occur that a page kept loading infinitely. In addition, when a user tried to sign in while their local browser storage still had older authentication settings stored, an incorrect message "You are not authorized to access this page" could be shown.

### 30 June 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Private label not rendered correctly in Firefox browser

If a private Catalog item was viewed using Firefox, it could occur that the private label was not rendered correctly.

### 30 June 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Incorrect deployment status shown

When a Catalog item is deployed, the deployment status is shown in the header of the Catalog item. However, if you used the search and navigated to another item afterwards, it could occur that the state of the previous Catalog item continued to be shown.

### 24 June 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Failing connector deployment

An issue has been resolved that could cause connector deployment to fail with the message "Something is wrong".

### 17 June 2025 - Enhancements - Various dataminer.services apps - Improved user session management

When a user goes to one of the dataminer.services apps, the app will now try to refresh their session if there is a valid refresh token. Previously, this was not the case. Most of the time, the user would be signed out in such a situation, but sometimes this could result in a situation where they were in the signed in and signed out state at the same time.

The lifetime of both the access token and refresh tokens have been reduced to make these more secure.

When a user is unauthenticated, the URL will stay as it is, but the user will see an unauthenticated view. This way, users can share and refresh links even when they are signed out.

### 17 June 2025  Enhancement - Admin - Users can now be added via a dropdown box

To make it easier and faster for Admin users to add users to a DMS, they can now select the users in a dropdown box. In this box, only the organization users will be listed that have not yet been added to the DMS.

Previously, adding users had to be done with an email input field where any email address could be specified, which could result in an error if an invalid address was specified.

### 17 June 2025 - Enhancement - Account Linking - Obsolete terminology updated

When a user links their DataMiner account to their dataminer.services account, the page will now mention "dataminer.services account" instead of the obsolete term "DCP account".

### 17 June 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Documentation improvements + cache notifier removal

When a new version of the Catalog app is released, users will no longer be notified when they are currently not using the latest version. While this notification was originally needed to keep users from encountering issues with caching, these will no longer occur, which means that the notification was no longer helpful.

The styling of the description of Catalog items has been enhanced to improve readability. Among others, the spacing between the headings has been adjusted. In addition, the width of the detail page has been adjusted, resulting in a cleaner reading section.

### 17 June 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Links to headings not taken into account

When the URL for a Catalog item included a heading, the app did not correctly scroll to that heading. Now these relative links will be taken into account, and the app will scroll down to the correct heading.

### 17 June 2025 - Enhancement - Updated support mail address

All instances of the former support address `techsupport@skyline.be` have been replaced with the new address <support@dataminer.services>.

### 17 June 2025 - Catalog - Fix - Not possible to click link to view all results

On the Catalog home page, a small overlay closure issue could make it impossible to click the link to view all results.

### 17 June 2025 - Enhancement - Admin - Keys now ellipsed when too large instead of shown with scrollbar

In the Admin app, keys will now be fully shown if there is enough place. Otherwise, their value will be ellipsed, and hovering over it will show the full value. Previously, a scrollbar was shown instead, which was not user-friendly.

### 17 June 2025 - Fix - Shares - Not possible to scroll in shared items list

Up till now, it was not possible to scroll through the shared items list, making it impossible to see the items towards the end of the list in case it contained a lot of items. Now scrolling will be possible.

### 17 June 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Improved alignment of featured sections on Catalog home page

The alignment of the featured sections on the Catalog home page has been improved to account for smaller screens. The page will now switch between one and three columns when necessary.

### 17 June 2025 - Enhancement - Admin - Improve unreachable nodes on DMS overview page

Previously, on the DMS overview page every unreachable node was listed separately. Now, the total number of unreachable nodes will be shown instead, and hovering over this number will show the exact names of the unreachable nodes. This information has also been moved to the Connection section of the page.

### 17 June 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Tags not updating after switching details page + side panel for private item incorrectly shown

In some cases, it could occur that when you went from one Catalog page to another, the tags of the second Catalog item were not correctly displayed.

It could also occur that the side panel of a private item was still shown when it was supposed to be hidden, for example after a switch to a different organization.

### 20 May 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Catalog item market

On the details page of a Catalog item, users will now be able to see the market for which the item is intended.

### 20 May 2025 - Enhancement - Admin - DMS overview links to DxM page

Links that direct to the DxM page on the DMS overview page in the Admin app will now open the link in the current tab of the browser instead of opening a new tab.

### 20 May 2025 - Enhancement - Unauthenticated views [ID 42921] [ID 42922]

Applications on *.dataminer.services will now support an unauthenticated view and navigate to the root page of the application when the user session expires or the user signs out.

Additionally, the loading animations on dataminer.services have been improved, and the Admin app will not be shown in available applications when the user is not signed in.

### 14 May 2025 - Fix - Invalid token after silent renew

When a user session was silently renewed, the token could become invalid, causing the application to go into an invalid state that made it impossible to complete user actions. Tokens should now be correctly renewed and not block application actions.

### 14 May 2025 - Fix - Admin - DxM updates giving false positives

When an installed DxM version was different than the latest available version, the update message would be shown, even if the installed version was not lower than the latest available version. This should no longer occur.

### 12 May 2025 - Fix - Share Management - Problem logging in if shared login is not supported [ID 42918]

If shared login was not supported by the browser, it could occur that logging in to Share Management was not possible.

### 12 May 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Market field renamed to Element Type in Catalog item details [ID 42917]

In the sidebar on the details page of Catalog items, the "Market" field has now been renamed to "Element Type", so that this more correctly indicates what this field represents.

### 08 May 2025 - Enhancement - Local sign-on fallback [ID 42883]

When experiencing issues with the shared single sign-on, applications will now fall back to a local sign-on.

### 08 May 2025 - Enhancement - Syncing authentication state across dataminer.services applications [ID 42882]

Signing in or out will now automatically sync to other applications without the need to refresh the page.

### 05 May 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Deletion of items by publishing organization [ID 42792] [ID 42793]

If you are a member of the organization that published a specific Catalog item, and you have the Owner or Admin role, you can now delete that Catalog item using a context menu at the top of the item's details page. When you do so, you will have to provide the reason for the deletion.

### 05 May 2025 - Fix - Usage Export - Selected DataMiner Systems not respected during export [ID 42865]

Previously, export requests in the Admin app ignored the DataMiner Systems selected by the user and exported all available data instead. This issue has been resolved. Export results are now correctly limited to the selected DataMiner Systems.

### 05 May 2025 - New feature - Single sign-on across various dataminer.services apps [ID 42768] [ID 42789]

Single sign-on (SSO) has been implemented across the Catalog, Admin, and Sharing apps on dataminer.services, as well as on the page used to connect Agents to dataminer.services and configure account linking. Users who sign in to one of these apps or pages will now be automatically signed in to the others, providing a more seamless user experience.

### 28 April 2025 - Fix - Usage API - Performance and stability improvements [ID 42791]

It was possible that an export request failed with an out of memory exception. This has been fixed.

In addition, retrieving usage data to display in the Admin app resulted in a timeout when a large amount of data had to be retrieved. Query performance has been improved to prevent this.

### 22 April 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Incorrect vendor name shown [ID 42769]

In some cases, it could occur that the wrong vendor name was shown.

### 22 April 2025 - Fix - Catalog API - Original ID and image path reset after item update [ID 42687]

When an item was updated via the manifest, the `ImagePath` and `OriginalId` property were reset. This will no longer occur.

### 22 April 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - 'Back' button removed from details pages [ID 42734]

As the "Back" button on the details page of a Catalog item had no real value, it has been removed.

### 22 April 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Browse page optimization [ID 42673]

Optimizations have been implemented on the Catalog browse page to prevent the page from becoming unresponsive when new items are loaded.

### 1 April 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - DMA now autoselected if user only has one [ID 42618]

When a user deploys a version of an item, a single DMA will now be selected by default if there is only one DMA to select. Previously, a DMA always had to be selected manually, even when there was only one available.

### 1 April 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Context menu for ranges and versions only shown for members of publishing organization [ID 42569]

The context menu for a Catalog item range and version is now only shown if the publishing organization of the item is currently selected, ensuring that the users viewing the menu are a member of this organization. Previously, it was also shown for users who had insufficient rights to be able to update or configure anything.

### 1 April 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog & Home - Show notifications bell for unauthenticated users [ID 42559]

In the Catalog app and on the dataminer.services homepage, users can now see the notifications button even when they are not signed in.

### 1 April 2025 - Fix - Admin, Catalog, Home & Sharing - User profile was visible after signing out [ID 42559]

In some cases, it could occur that you could still see your user profile even after clicking *Sign out*. This issue affected the Admin app, Catalog app, Sharing app, and dataminer.services homepage.

### 1 April 2025 - Fix - Catalog API - Users could update ranges and versions they did not have rights to [ID 42566]

It could occur that users were able to update the range/version state or set/delete a custom tag for items that they did not publish, even though they should not have the rights to do so. Now a user who tries to do so will get a "Forbidden" error.

### 1 April 2025 - New feature - Catalog API - Ability to retrieve vendors [ID 42633]

It is now possible to retrieve vendors using the public Catalog API. For the full API reference, go to [Public Catalog API Swagger](https://catalogapi-prod.cca-prod.aks.westeurope.dataminer.services/swagger/index.html?urls.primaryName=Public+Catalog+API+v2.0).

The ID of a vendor can (optionally) be used to set the vendor for a Catalog item using any existing create, register, or update Catalog API call. For the full API reference, go to [Key Catalog API Swagger](https://catalogapi-prod.cca-prod.aks.westeurope.dataminer.services/swagger/index.html?urls.primaryName=Key+Catalog+API+v2.0).

### 13 March 2025 - Enhancement - Admin - Tooltips for long node names [ID 42510]

In the Admin app, on the overview page for a DataMiner System, tooltips will now be shown for the titles of nodes in case these are too long to be displayed. Previously, long names were clipped, causing users to be unable to see the last part of the names.

### 13 March 2025 - Enhancement - Improved initial loading of dataminer.services applications [ID 42510] [ID 42476]

The initial load times of applications under .dataminer.services have been improved. This has been done by enabling gzip compression and enabling caching of fonts with the .woff and .woff2 extension. The font files have also been updated to leave a smaller footprint.

### 11 March 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Deployment on multiple DataMiner Systems at once not working correctly [ID 42474]

Up to now, if a Catalog item was deployed to multiple systems at once, only the last deployment was executed and the others were canceled. This will no longer occur.

### 11 March 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Context menu on version and ranges hidden when not authenticated [ID 42459]

When a user is not authenticated, they will now no longer be able to see the button to open the actions for a version or range in the Catalog.

### 11 March 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Incorrect Deploy button state when not authenticated [ID 42439]

Previously, the *Deploy* button for a Catalog item version was always enabled when the user was not authenticated, even if the version had issues. This occurred because certain checks could not be performed when the user was not logged in yet. This issue has now been resolved. The *Deploy* button will now be correctly disabled if there are any issues with the version, regardless of authentication status.

Note that in case the button is displayed as enabled while a user is not logged in, it may still be disabled again after they log in case further issues are detected, such as the absence of a working DMS connected to dataminer.services.

### 11 March 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Ranges displayed for all items [ID 42426]

The Catalog now displays version ranges for all item types. Previously, ranges were only displayed for connectors. A range is created when a version ID follows a semantic format (e.g. x.x.x.x or x.x.x). Other versions are grouped under *other*.

### 11 March 2025 - Fix - Catalog API - Different recommended versions shown depending on API used [ID 42464]

Up to now, it could occur that different recommended versions were shown based on which API was called. Now the different Catalog APIs (key, user, and public) use a shared logic to determine the recommended versions for a Catalog item, so this will no longer occur.

### 7 March 2025 - Fix - Incorrect DataMiner System status on dataminer.services home page [ID 42445]

The status of DataMiner Systems (including DaaS systems) could be shown as "unknown" for users with the "Member" role in the organization. This also resulted in an incorrect status being shown for a newly deployed DaaS system. This issue has been resolved.

### 7 March 2025 - Fix - Connection to dataminer.services lost after using 10.4 installer [ID 42430]

If the DataMiner 10.4 installer was used to install a DataMiner Agent and connect it to dataminer.services, it could occur that the specified credentials did not allow the connection to dataminer.services and STaaS to be renewed, causing it to eventually be lost.

### 7 March 2025 - Fix - Admin - Export of large amount of usage data failed [ID 42378]

In the Admin app, exporting usage data to a CSV file could fail when there was a large amount of data to be retrieved. The performance of the export has been improved, and it will now be able to handle large amounts of data.

### 6 March 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Deployment status information not updated correctly [ID 42405]

When an item was deployed from the Catalog, it could occur that the status of the deployment was not updated correctly, showing that the deployment was still pending even though this was no longer the case. To resolve this issue, the duration for checking the status of the active deployment has been increased to around 5 minutes, while before this was only 10 seconds. If the deployment is still pending after a certain amount of polling tries, this will result in a timeout state.

### 6 March 2025 - Fix - Catalog API - Incorrect sorting of Catalog items by name [ID 42398]

When new items were registered in the Catalog, a property used for sorting was not set correctly. As a consequence, when you sorted by name in ascending order, all new items were shown at the top. This issue has been resolved.

### 6 March 2025 - Fix - Admin - Settings page state incorrect when switching to other DMS [ID 42338]

When a setting on the DMS settings page was changed in the Admin app, the relevant section went into edit mode, allowing the user to save the changes. However, if the user then opened another DMS settings page, the edit state of the page was not reset, resulting in edit mode actions being displayed while this should not be the case. This issue has been resolved.

### 6 March 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog API - Public endpoint added to check if version can be deployed [ID 42415]

You can now check whether a version can be deployed without logging in, using the "can-deploy" endpoint on the public controller.

### 6 March 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Improved message in case no description is available for a Catalog item [ID 42342]

In case no description has been added for a Catalog item, the displayed message to inform the user of this has been improved.

### 25 February 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Search results of Catalog showed non-user-friendly name instead of display name [ID 42347]

Up to now, it could occur that the results of a Catalog search showed the non-user-friendly name of an item instead of the display name.

### 25 February 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Duplicate owners [ID 42346]

In some cases, when a Catalog object was retrieved, duplicate owners could be returned. In addition, when a Catalog item was registered, it was possible to specify an owner in the manifest that was not unique, even though owners should always be unique. These issues have been resolved.

### 24 February 2025 - New feature - Catalog API - Public call to get all types [ID 42340]

A new call is available that allows users to get all the Catalog item types without the need to authenticate. For the full API reference, go to [Public Catalog API Swagger](https://catalogapi-prod.cca-prod.aks.westeurope.dataminer.services/swagger/index.html?urls.primaryName=Public+Catalog+API+v2.0).

### 20 February 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Deploy button not shown when switching pages [ID 42317]

When a user quickly switched to the *Versions* page, it could occur that the *Deploy* button incorrectly was not shown.

### 20 February 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Vendor logo not shown correctly [ID 42295]

When the image for a vendor logo could not be shown, it could occur that instead the "Vendor logo" alt text was shown. Now it will instead correctly fall back to the default icon, and the loading state of the image has also been improved.

### 20 February 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Problem viewing unsupported versions in case no supported versions were available for a Catalog item [ID 42254]

On the *Versions* tab of a Catalog item, it could occur that it was not possible to view unsupported versions in case no supported versions were available.

### 20 February 2025 - Enhancement - DataMiner.services - Home app now accessible without login + improved authentication flow [ID 42246]

Users now no longer need to log in to view the home app. A default view will be loaded in that case. The deploy page will still require authentication.

In addition, when something goes wrong during the authentication flow, users will now see a message instead of being redirected to the login.

### 20 February 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Problem with sorting on type on the Browse page [ID 42242]

Because of a possible problem with the sorting on type of the Browse page, this option has now temporarily been removed.

### 20 February 2025 - Fix - Catalog - IndexOutOfBoundsException when retrieving recommended versions [ID 42237]

In some cases, calls to retrieve the recommended versions of Catalog items could result in an IndexOutOfBoundsException.

### 20 February 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Removal of private versions [ID 42084] [ID 42243]

It is now no longer possible to have private versions of Catalog items. While a Catalog item itself can still be private, it is no longer possible to have specific versions of an item that are private.

Consequently, versions can no longer have the *IsPublished* property, and, in the User Catalog API, the `/api/user/catalog/v2-0/catalogs/connectors/publishing-state` call is now considered obsolete and the `/api/user/catalog/v2-0/catalogs/{catalogId}/versions/{versionId}/publishing-state` call is no longer available.

### 18 February 2025 - Fix - Incorrect DMS status for systems with large DataMiner version history [ID 42301]

If a DataMiner System had a large version history, it could occur that its system status could not be offloaded. To prevent this issue, now only the last 10 DataMiner versions are offloaded.

### 11 February 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Deployment status shown on details page [ID 42131]

When an item is deployed, the deployment status is now shown next to the *Deploy* button both in the item version section and at the top of the details page. The status is automatically updated for up to 10 seconds, and you will get a notification when the deployment finishes or fails.

### 11 February 2025 - Fix - Share Management - Incorrect message after sharing dashboard [ID 42121]

When a dashboard was shared, the incorrect message "A share has been updated" was shown instead of the message "Item has successfully been shared.". This issue has been resolved.

### 11 February 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - New version statuses [ID 42078]

The Catalog now uses the following statuses for versions:

- **Pre-release** (previously "development")
- **Stable** (previously "active")
- **Unlisted** (previously "known issues" or "deprecated")

### 6 February 2025 - Fix - Random failures when sharing, deploying DxMs or Catalog items, or using the DataMiner Teams bot [ID 42178]

The Remote Access and Live Sharing performance and stability improvements released on the 4th of February introduced a specific issue that only occurred if a CloudGateway version older than 2.17.0 was restarted or updated. The issue could cause random failures while creating or updating shares, deploying DxM updates from the Admin app, deploying Catalog items, or using the DataMiner Teams Bot. This issue has now been resolved with immediate effect.

### 4 February 2025 - Enhancement - Remote Access and Live Sharing performance and stability improvements [ID 42129]

Several enhancements were made to improve performance and stability for all Remote Access and Live Sharing features with immediate effect.

In addition, dataminer.services now supports the creation of multiple connections instead of one by CloudGateway version 2.17.0 or higher, to increase throughput and stability even further.

### 4 February 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Deployment messages now contain Catalog item type [ID 41766]

When a Catalog item is deployed, the deployment info message will now contain the type of the Catalog item.

### 30 January 2025 - Enhancement - Admin - Usage page improvements [ID 42054]

In the Admin app, the tabs and sections of the Usage page have been reordered to allow better navigation. Improvements for smaller devices have also been implemented.

### 30 January 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Category icons [ID 42051]

Catalog items now show category icons when no vendor logo or image is available. The category icon is also shown on the browse page with the type filters.

### 30 January 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog API - API calls returning Catalog items will now include the CategoryId property [ID 42044]

API calls that return one or more Catalog items will now include the *CategoryId* property.

### 30 January 2025 - Enhancement - Catalog - Auto-login for returning users [ID 42041]

Users of the Catalog app who were logged in previously will now be automatically logged back in, even if their session has expired.

### 30 January 2025 - New feature - Catalog - Notification when new app version is available + support for installation as PWA [ID 42036]

The Catalog app will now notify you when a new version is available. In addition, it can now be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

### 30 January 2025 - Fix - Catalog - Query parameters shown incorrectly [ID 42035]

Previously, it could occur that query parameters were shown in the Catalog app when they were not needed. Now query parameters will only be added on the browse page and only if you configure any filter or sorting.

### 30 January 2025 - New feature - Admin - DaaS usage [ID 42030]

You can now view your DaaS usage directly on the Usage page in the Admin app and export it.

### 30 January 2025 - Enhancement - Admin - Deployments - Duplicate load calls prevented [ID 41989]
