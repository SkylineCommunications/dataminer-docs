#### Improved detection of grandmaster changes [ID 38432]

The following improvements have been implemented in the PTP app:

- Overall performance and stability of the PTP app has improved when a PTP device starts synchronizing with a different grandmaster.

- In the *Summary* tab of the PTP app, the devices overview pop-up window now includes a *Refresh* button. When you click this button, the local clock identity and reporter grandmaster clock identity of all devices is retrieved and the status of the devices is calculated again. When elements are stopped, the clock identities will be filled in as *N/A* and the status will be filled in as *Unknown*. This refresh is also executed automatically every 30 minutes.

> [!NOTE]
