# PTP 1.2.0

> [!NOTE]
> This version requires that **DataMiner 10.6.2.0-16783** or higher is installed.

## New features

#### Catalog deployment

The PTP Solution can now be deployed [directly from the Catalog](https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/9c5eb0a1-43bc-42d2-bca2-de4982ee57d7).

#### New low-code app UI

A brand-new low-code app has been added, which allows you to monitor all PTP domains from any browser.

#### New GQI ad hoc data sources

To support the new low-code app, multiple GQI ad hoc data sources have been added. These will supply the necessary PTP data to the app in real time.

> [!NOTE]
> These GQI ad hoc data sources need the [GQI DXM](xref:GQI_DxM) to function properly.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Renamed automation scripts

The automation scripts used to configure the PTP Solution have been renamed to match the standards.

#### Standard PTP mediation connector updated to version 1.0.0.26

The version of the mediation connector *Standard DataMiner PTP Device* included in the PTP package has been incremented from 1.0.0.22 to 1.0.0.26.

> [!NOTE]
> New versions of the mediation connector can be deployed independently of the PTP app.
