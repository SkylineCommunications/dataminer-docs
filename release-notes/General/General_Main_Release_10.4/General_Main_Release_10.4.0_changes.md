<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

When, in an Automation script launched from a web app, an input field contains an invalid value, the border of that field will turn red. This red border will now be wider in order to be more visible.

#### GQI: Enhanced performance of GQI queries [ID_34977]

- *01/01/2022 9:30:00 > 01/01/2022 10:30:00*

... it will convert those timespans into the following time range:

- *01/01/2022 9:00:00 > 01/01/2022 10:30:00*

#### GQI: Enhanced query performance when aggregation operations are followed by a filter [ID_35110]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall query performance has increased, especially in cases where aggregation operations are followed by a filter.

### Fixes

#### Mobile apps: Problem when trying to select an item in a drop-down box [ID_34742]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.2.12 [CU0] -->

In some cases, it would incorrectly not be possible to select an item in a drop-down box when the items were grouped or when their actual value was not identical to the value that was displayed.

#### GQI: Problem when retrieving DCF interfaces [ID_34820]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

When a GQI query returned all DCF interfaces from all agents in the DataMiner System, the NATS message broker would throw a *MaxPayloadException* when *MaxPayload* exceeded the value configured in `C:\Skyline DataMiner\NATS\nats-streaming-server\nats-server.config`.

From now on, when a GQI query has to retrieve DCF interfaces, it will do so by querying one agent at a time.

#### Problem with Resource Manager when ResourceStorageType was not specified in Resource Manager settings [ID_34981]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

In some cases, Resource Manager could throw a NullReferenceException when *ResourceStorageType* was not specified in the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\ResourceManager\Config.xml` file.

#### GQI: Problem when a column select or a column manipulation operator was applied before an aggregation operator [ID_35009]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 [CU0] -->

When a column select or a column manipulation operator was applied before an aggregation operator, the column select or column manipulation operator would incorrectly be ignored. As a result, all columns would be visible in the *group by node* or columns created by the column manipulation would not be added to the options of the *group by node*.
