#### DataMiner Object Models: DomInstanceButtonDefinitions can only reference a single action [ID_35156]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

From now on, DomInstanceButtonDefinitions can only reference a single action. If multiple actions are defined, a `DomBehaviorDefinitionError` with reason `InvalidButtonActionCombination` will be returned.

Also, when using the DomBehaviorDefinition inheritance system, the server-side logic will now make sure that there are no buttons or actions with identical IDs on both the parent and child definition.

- If a duplicate action is found, a `DomBehaviorDefinitionError` with reason `DuplicateActionDefinitionIds` will be returned.
- If a duplicate button is found, a `DomBehaviorDefinitionError` with reason `DuplicateButtonDefinitionIds` will be returned.

#### SLLogCollector: Custom CollectorConfig XML files will now be synchronized across the DataMiner cluster [ID_35180]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

From now on, all custom CollectorConfig XML files will be synchronized across the DataMiner cluster.

#### SLAnalytics - Pattern matching: Manually created tags will now be saved as pattern occurrences [ID_35299]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

From now on, when you define a tag for pattern matching, the pattern you selected will be saved as a pattern occurrence in the Elasticsearch database and highlighted in bright orange, similar to so-called "streaming matches", which are detected while tracking for trend patterns whenever a trended parameter is updated.

#### SLDataGateway: Memory enhancements with regard to average trending [ID_35312]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

In the SLDataGateway process, a number of memory enhancements have been made with regard to the management of average trend data.

#### Maps: Markers will now move more gradual when zooming [ID_35337]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, markers will now move more gradual when zooming.

#### Alarm templates - Smart baseline calculations: NullReferenceException prevented & enhanced exception logging [ID_35348]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

In some cases, a `Baseline Calculation Failed: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object` error would be added to the *SLSmartBaselineManager.txt* log file. The issue causing that error has now been fixed.

Also, log entries indicating an exception thrown during baseline calculations will now include details regarding the element and parameter associated with the exception.

#### Maps: Enhanced zooming behavior [ID_35351]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

From now on, when you zoom in or out, the data of the previous zoom level will stay visible until the data of the current zoom level has been loaded.

#### Maps: Zoom range can now be set by means of a slider [ID_35381]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

The zoom range of a map can now be set by means of a slider.

#### SLAnalytics - Automatic incident tracking: Enhanced performance when fetching relation information [ID_35414] [ID_35508]

<!-- 35414:  MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->
<!-- 35508:  MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.4 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when fetching relation information for the automatic incident tracking feature.

#### Security enhancements [ID_35434] [ID_35997] [ID_36319] [ID_36624] [ID_36928]

<!-- 35434: MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.4 -->
<!-- 35997: MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->
<!-- 36319/36928: MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->
<!-- 36624: MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.8 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: No longer available for discrete parameters [ID_35465]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

From now on, anomaly detection will no longer be available for discrete parameters.

#### SLAnalytics - Pattern matching: Enhanced performance when detecting large patterns [ID_35474]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.4 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when detecting trend patterns that cover more than 30,000 data points.

#### SLNetClientTest: New DOM-related features [ID_35550]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

In the *SLNetClientTest* tool, the following new DOM-related features have been made available:

- Viewing a JSON representation of a selected ModuleSettings configuration.

- Completely remove a DOM Manager from the system.

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > - When you instruct the *SLNetClientTest* tool to delete a DOM Manager, it will count the number of DOM instances. If the DOM Manager in question contains more than 10,000 DOM instances, an error message will appear, saying that deleting the DOM Manager would take too long.

  > - When you instruct the *SLNetClientTest* tool to delete a DOM Manager, it will not remove the indices from the Elasticsearch database. These indices have to be deleted manually. If you do not delete them manually, we recommend to not re-use the module ID as this could cause configuration conflicts.

> [!CAUTION]
> Always be extremely careful when using this tool, as it can have far-reaching consequences on the functionality of your DataMiner System.

#### SLAnalytics will now send regular notifications instead of client notifications [ID_35591]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.4 -->

Up to now, when SLAnalytics sent a notification, it would generate an event of type *client notification* with parameter ID 64574. From now on, it will instead generate an event of type *notification* with parameter ID 64570.

#### SLAnalytics - Proactive cap detection: Enhanced accuracy [ID_35695]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.4 -->

Proactive cap detection predicts future issues based on trend data in the Cassandra database. Because of a number of enhancements, overall prediction accuracy has increased.

#### Service & Resource Management: Bookings of type 'Custom Process Automation' no longer consume license credits [ID_35742]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.4 -->

From now on, ReservationInstances of type *Custom Process Automation* will no longer consume SRM credits. This means that, from now on, you can schedule an unlimited number of concurrent bookings of type *Custom Process Automation*.

#### SLAnalytics: A message will be added to the SLAnalytics.txt log file when no Cassandra database is present [ID_35748]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

Up to now, SLAnalytics would stop working without giving any notice whatsoever when it was started on a system without a Cassandra database.

From now on, when no Cassandra database is present, SLAnalytics will be stopped gracefully and a message will be added to the *SLAnalytics.txt* log file.

#### SLNetClientTest: More user-friendly pop-up window will now appear when connecting to a DMA that uses external authentication via SAML [ID_35755]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

When, in the SLNetClientTest tool, you connected to a DataMiner Agent that used external authentication via SAML, up to now, a pop-up window showing the authentication URL would prompt you to enter the SAML response string. From now on, a pop-up window similar to the one used in Cube will appear instead.

> [!CAUTION]
> Always be extremely careful when using this tool, as it can have far-reaching consequences on the functionality of your DataMiner System.

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance when loading service profile instances [ID_35878]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when loading service profile instances.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Events associated with a DVE child element will no longer be linked to the DVE parent element [ID_35901]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

Up to now, when an event associated with a DVE child element was generated, internally, that event would be linked to the DVE parent element. From now on, it will be linked to the child element instead.

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance when stopping an ongoing booking [ID_36255]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.6 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when stopping an ongoing booking.

#### SLAnalytics - Pattern matching: No automatic pattern matching anymore after creating or editing a pattern [ID_36265]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.8 -->

Up to now, when a trend pattern was created or edited, the system would automatically start searching for that new or updated pattern. Now, this will no longer happen. Pattern matching will only be done after explicitly sending a `getPatternMatchMessage`.

#### SLAnalytics - Automatic incident tracking: Relations based on alarm data will now also be taken into account [ID_36337]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.7 -->

Up to now, alarm grouping based on parameter relationship data would only take into account relations based on change points. From now on, relations based on alarm data will also be taken into account.

On systems running alarm grouping based on both parameter and alarm relationship data, the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\analytics\configuration.xml` will contain an `<item>` tag like the following. Note that `cpRelationThreshold` has been renamed to `relationThreshold` and that its value is set to 0.7 by default.

Example:

```xml
<Value type="skyline::dataminer::analytics::workers::configuration::RelationVisitorConfiguration">
   <enable>true</enable>
   <relationThreshold>0.7</relationThreshold>
</Value>
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Always be extremely careful when changing any of the settings configured in `C:\Skyline DataMiner\analytics\configuration.xml`, as it can have far-reaching consequences on the functionality of your DataMiner System.

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance when creating and updating bookings [ID_36391]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.8 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when creating and updating bookings, especially on systems with a large number of overlapping bookings.

#### SLAnalytics: Overall accuracy of the proactive cap detection function has increased [ID_36476]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.8 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall accuracy of the proactive cap detection function has increased.

#### Enhancements in order to deal with situations where HTTP traffic is modified [ID_36540]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.8 -->

A number of enhancements have been made in order to deal with situations where proxy servers, gateways, routers or firewalls modify HTTP traffic.

#### Cassandra Cleaner can now also be used to clean the 'infotrace' table [ID_36592]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

Up to now, the *Cassandra Cleaner* tool could only be used to remove data from the *timetrace* table. From now on, it can also be used to remove data from the *infotrace* table.

1. In the *db.yaml* file, set `table.name` to "infotrace".

   By default, `table.name` is set to "timetrace".

1. Specify a time range by setting the `delete.start.time` and `delete.end.time` fields.

  > [!CAUTION]
  > All infotrace data between the `delete.start.time` and `delete.end.time` timestamps will be deleted, so be careful.

1. Run the following command: `clean -l`

   > [!NOTE]
   > The *infotrace* table can only be cleaned using the `clean -l` command.

For more information, see [Cassandra Cleaner](xref:Cassandra_Cleaner).

#### SLAnalytics - Automatic incident tracking: Alarms will no longer be regrouped after a manual operation [ID_36595]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.8 -->

Up to now, manually removing an alarm from an incident could result in that alarm being regrouped with another existing or newly created incident. Also when you manually cleared an incident could all base alarms of that incident be regrouped.

From now on, alarms will no longer be regrouped after a manual operation.

#### SLAnalytics - Automatic incident tracking: Automatic incidents can now also be cleared manually [ID_36600]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.8 -->

From now on, users will be allowed to manually clear automatic incidents.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection & Proactive cap detection: Enhanced caching mechanism [ID_36639]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.8 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the caching mechanism used by the *Behavioral anomaly detection* and *Proactive cap detection* features.

#### SLProtocol is now a 64-bit process by default [ID_36725]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

SLProtocol is now a 64-bit process by default.

However, if necessary, it can still be run as a 32-bit process. For more information, see [Activating SLProtocol as a 32-bit process](xref:Activating_SLProtocol_as_a_32_Bit_Process).

#### DataMiner Object Models: DomInstanceHistory will now be saved asynchronously [ID_36785]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

When a DomInstance is created or updated, a HistoryChange record is stored in the database, and when a DomInstance is deleted, all HistoryChange objects associated with that DomInstance are deleted from the database. Up to now, those HistoryChange records were always created, updated and deleted synchronously.

From now on, all DOM managers will create, update and delete their HistoryChange records asynchronously, which will considerably enhance overall performance when creating, updating or deleting DomInstances.

Using the new `DomInstanceHistoryStorageBehavior` enum on the new `DomInstanceHistorySettings` class, you can configure whether HistoryChange records will be stored and how they will be stored. See the following example:

```csharp
â€‹ModuleSettings.DomManagerSettings.DomInstanceHistorySettings.StorageBehavior = DomInstanceHistoryStorageBehavior.Disabled;
```

The `DomInstanceHistoryStorageBehavior` can be set to one of three values:

- **EnabledAsync** (default value): The HistoryChange records will be created, updated and deleted asynchronously.

- **EnabledSync**: The HistoryChange records will be created and deleted synchronously.

- **Disabled**: No HistoryChange records will be created, updated or deleted.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you set the value to "Disabled" after it had been set to one of the other options, the existing HistoryChange records in the database will be left untouched, even if the corresponding DomInstance is deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> When you delete a DomInstance with a large number of associated HistoryChange records, deleting all those HistoryChange records can take a long time, even when this is done asynchronously. Therefore, we recommend disabling the creation of HistoryChange records if you do not need them.

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance when adding or updating ReservationInstances [ID_36788]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when adding or updating ReservationInstances, especially on systems with a large number of overlapping bookings and a large number of bookings using the same resources.

#### SLAnalytics - Automatic incident tracking: Root time of an alarm group will be set to the most recent of the base alarm root times [ID_36809]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

From now on, the root time of an alarm group (i.e. the time of arrival of the first alarm in the alarm group tree) will be set to the most recent of the base alarm root times.

Up to now, when alarm groups were recreated after a DataMiner upgrade, their time of arrival and root time was set to the time of the upgrade.

#### DataMiner upgrade: Microsoft .NET 5 will no longer be installed by default [ID_36815]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

Up to now, Microsoft .NET 5 would always be installed during a DataMiner upgrade. As all DataMiner components using .NET 5 have been upgraded to use .NET 6 instead, .NET 5 will no longer be installed by default.

> [!NOTE]
> If Microsoft .NET 5 is present, it will not be automatically uninstalled during a DataMiner upgrade.  

#### Elasticsearch/OpenSearch: Unused suggest indices have been disabled [ID_36875]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

Up to now, each time a new DOM manager was initialized, SLDataGateway would create a main data index and a suggest index in the Elasticsearch database for each DOM type. As these suggest indices are not used, they have now been disabled. As a result, overall performance will increase when initializing new DOM managers.

Other unused suggest indices have been disabled as well. This will have a positive impact on the hardware resources required for Elasticsearch or OpenSearch.

The following suggest indices have been disabled:

- ApiDefinition
- ApiToken
- AutoIncrementer
- DomBehaviorDefinition
- DomDefinition
- DomInstance
- DomTemplate
- HistoryChange
- JobDomain
- JobTemplate
- MediationSnippet
- ModuleSettings
- PaProcess
- Parameter
- PaToken
- ProfileDefinition
- ProfileInstance
- Record
- RecordDefinition
- ReservationDefinition
- ReservationInstance
- Resource
- ResourcePool
- SectionDefinition
- ServiceDefinition
- ServiceDeletionHistory
- ServiceProfileDefinition
- ServiceProfileInstance
- SRMServiceInfo
- SRMSettableServiceState
- Ticket
- TicketFieldResolver
- TicketHistory
- VirtualFunctionDefinition
- VirtualFunctionProtocolMeta

> [!NOTE]
> Existing suggest indices will not automatically be removed from the database. You can remove them manually if necessary.

#### SLNetClientTest: Enhancements made to 'DataMiner Object Model' window [ID_36891]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the *DataMiner Object Model* window.

- The *DataMiner Object Model* window will now only subscribe to the events of the DOM manager you selected in the *ModuleSettings* window. Up to now, it would subscribe to all events of all DOM managers.

- The *DomInstances* and *History* pages will initially only load up to 500 objects. A warning message at the top of the window will indicate that only a limited list was loaded, and that you will need to click *Refresh* to load all items.

- The objects listed on the *DomInstances* and *History* pages will now be sorted by the data that was last modified (descending), allowing you to quickly see the recently updated objects.

- On the *History* page, the GUID of the DomInstance will no longer have a "DomInstanceId" prefix.

- The *Attachments* page will no longer load all DomInstances at startup. If you want all DomInstances to be loaded, you will need to click *Load all DOM instances*.

- On the *SectionDefinitions* page, the IDs of the section definitions will now be shown in the first column.

- When you click *View* after selecting a section definition, the text will no longer include a *Validators* line if no validators could be found.

- When no name is assigned to a *DomBehaviorDefinition* or a *DomDefinition*, the text "(no name)" will appear to indicate that no name was assigned.

- If, on any of the pages, you want to select an item in a table, you can now click the item anywhere. Up to now, you had to click the cell in the first column.

> [!CAUTION]
> Always be extremely careful when using this tool, as it can have far-reaching consequences on the functionality of your DataMiner System.

#### Service & Resource Management: Improved ResourceManager logging [ID_36989]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->

The ResourceManager logging (*SLResourceManager.txt*) has been improved to make debugging easier.

Some log entries have been rewritten to make them clearer, have been assigned another log level or have been removed entirely.

#### DataMiner Object Models: Bulk deletion of history records when deleting a DOM instance [ID_37012]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->

Up to now, when a DOM instance was deleted, the associated HistoryChange records were removed one by one. From now on, when a DOM instance is deleted, its HistoryChange records will be deleted in bulk. This will greatly improve overall performance when deleting DOM instances, especially when they are deleted synchronously.

### Fixes

#### Problem with Resource Manager when ResourceStorageType was not specified in Resource Manager settings [ID_34981]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

In some cases, Resource Manager could throw a NullReferenceException when *ResourceStorageType* was not specified in the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\ResourceManager\Config.xml` file.

#### External authentication via SAML: Issues fixed when using Okta as identity provider [ID_35374]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

Using Okta as identity provider, it would incorrectly no longer be possible to read out signed assertions. Also, when the group claim setting is enabled in the *DataMiner.xml* file, the user will now be added to the correct groups.

Up to now, in case of a claim mismatch, an exception would be thrown. From now on, an entry containing a clear message will be added to the *SLNet.txt* log file instead.

#### Automation: DataMiner would incorrectly remove the xmlns attribute when importing or saving an Automation script [ID_35708]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.4 -->

When DataMiner imported or saved an Automation script, it would incorrectly remove the `xmlns` attribute specified in the `<DMSScript>` element, even when that attribute had been added by DataMiner Integration Studio. From now on, when DataMiner imports or saves an Automation script, it will no longer remove this attribute. Moreover, if no such attribute is specified, it will automatically add `xmlns="http://www.skyline.be/automation"`.

Example:

```xml
<DMSScript options="272" xmlns="http://www.skyline.be/automation">
   <Name>...</Name>
   ...
</DMSScript>
```

#### DateTime instances would not get serialized correctly when an SLNet connection supported protocol buffer serialization [ID_35777]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

When an SLNet connection supported protocol buffer serialization, DateTime instances would not get serialized correctly.

#### Input/output values of a matrix element would incorrectly be overridden due to a caching issue [ID_35857]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.4 [CU0] -->

When an ElementProtocol object was being created, due to a caching issue in SLNet, the input/output values stored in the protocol of a matrix element would incorrectly be overridden with the input/output values in the ElementProtocol object that was being created.

#### Message broker: Memory leak [ID_35898]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.4 [CU0] -->

The native message broker code could leak memory when using the request/response workflow in combination with chunking. The message handlers would not be cleaned up after the response had been received.

#### Business Intelligence: Outage correction would incorrectly be increased when a history alarm affected the outage [ID_35942]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

When a history alarm affected a closed outage to which a correction had been applied, the correction would incorrectly be increased. From now on, the correction will be left untouched.

#### Handle in the Timer class would not be cleaned correctly [ID_35959]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.4 [CU0] -->

In some cases, a handle in the Timer class would not be cleaned correctly, causing handles to leak.

#### DataMiner Object Models: Problem when creating a DomInstance with an empty status [ID_36063]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.6 -->

When a DomInstance was created with an empty status, in some cases, a `MultipleSectionsNotAllowedForSectionDefinition` error could be returned, even when the configuration was correct.

#### External authentication via SAML: Removal of whitespace characters from signatures would cause validation to fail [ID_36181]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.6 -->

In some cases, whitespace characters would incorrectly be removed from signatures, causing validation to fail.

#### NATS auto-reconnect mechanism could lead to a situation in which a large number of TCP ports were left open [ID_36339]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

When NATS tried to automatically reconnect at a moment when none of the servers were available, it would incorrectly not wait for a while until the cluster was online again. In some cases, this could lead to a situation in which a large number of TCP ports were left open.

#### Community credentials from the credential library would be ignored for SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 [ID_36353]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.7 -->

When, in element settings, community credentials from the credential library were used, those credentials would be ignored for SNMPv1 and SNMPv2. The get-community and set-community configured on the element would incorrectly be used instead.

#### NATS connection could fail due to payloads being too large [ID_36427]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.8 -->

In some cases, the NATS connection could fail due to payloads being too large. As a result, parameter updates and alarms would no longer be saved to the database.

#### SLNet would incorrectly return certain port information fields of type string as null values [ID_36524]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.8 -->

When element information was retrieved from SLNet, in some cases, certain port information fields of type string would incorrectly be returned as a null value instead of an empty string value. As a result, DataMiner Cube would no longer show the port information when you edited an element.

Affected port information fields:

- BusAddress
- Number
- PollingIPAddress
- PollingIPPort

#### Cassandra Cluster Migrator would fail to start up [ID_36804]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.8 [CU0] -->

When the *Cassandra Cluster Migrator* tool (*SLCCMigrator.exe*) was started, in some cases, it would get stuck in the initialization phase due to a connection issue.

#### Certain alarms would have their 'root creation time' set incorrectly [ID_36812]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

In some cases, the *root creation time* of an alarm would not be equal to the *creation time* of the root alarm.

For example, when an alarm group was created with an old time of arrival, the *root creation time* would be set to the root time (i.e. the time of arrival of the root alarm), while the *creation time* would be set to the time at which the alarm was created.

#### Problem when renaming an element [ID_36855]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

In some rare cases, an error could be thrown when an element was renamed.

#### Deprecated DMS_GET_INFO call could return unexpected DVE child data [ID_36964]

The deprecated DMS_GET_INFO call would return unexpected data when it returned data of elements that contained remotely hosted DVE child elements.
