### Enhancements

#### Enhanced performance and error handling when loading virtual elements [ID 39478]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when loading virtual elements.

Also, error handling when loading virtual elements has been improved.

#### SLAnalytics: Alarms and suggestion events for virtual functions will now be generated on the parent element [ID 39707]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When, in the scope of behavioral anomaly detection, proactive cap detection or pattern matching, SLAnalytics has to generate alarms or suggestion events for virtual functions, from now on, it will generate them on the parent element. However, it will continue to generate alarms and suggestion events for all other kinds of DVEs on the child element.

#### NATS configuration can now be reset by calling an endpoint of SLEndpointTool.dll [ID 39871]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.8 -->

From now on, the NATS configuration can be reset by calling the following endpoint in e.g. an Automation script:

`SLEndpointTool.Config.NATSConfigManager.ResetNATSConfiguration()`

#### SLAnalytics - Alarm focus & Automatic incident tracking: Alarms generated for child DVE elements using a parameter ID from the main DVE element will now also be taken into account [ID 39988]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

From now on, alarms generated for child DVE elements using a parameter ID from the main DVE element can also get a focus value and, as a result, be grouped by Automatic incident tracking.

#### SLAutomation: Enhanced compilation of Automation scripts [ID 39965]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

A number of enhancements have been made with regard to the compilation of Automation scripts.

#### DataMiner upgrade: ResetConfig.txt will no longer be added to FilesToDelete.txt [ID 39994]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

Every DataMiner upgrade package includes a *FilesToDelete.txt* file, which lists all files in the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\` folder that should be deleted during the upgrade procedure. From now on, the *ResetConfig.txt* file will no longer be added to that list of files to be deleted.

The `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Files\ResetConfig.txt` file is a file used by the factory reset tool *SLReset.exe* as a whitelist to determine which files to keep. The first time *SLReset.exe* is executed, the default whitelist is added to *ResetConfig.txt*. Afterwards, you can add files you want to keep to this whitelist, so that these are not removed when the tool is executed again. If you delete *ResetConfig.txt*, the default whitelist will be used again.

#### Storage as a Service: Event hub throttling errors will now be logged as 'Warning' instead of 'Error' [ID 40018]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

From now on, event hub throttling errors will be logged as 'Warning' instead of 'Error'.

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced logging when booking objects are added to, updated in or deleted from the cache [ID 40043]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When booking objects are added to, updated in or deleted from the cache, from now on, the following properties of the booking in question will be logged:

- Booking status
- Booking resources
- Time when the booking was last modified

#### Factory reset tool will now use an absolute path to locate ResetConfig.txt [ID 40074]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

Up to now, the factory reset tool *SLReset.exe* always used the relative path `.\\` to locate the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Files\ResetConfig.txt` file, assuming that it would always be executed from the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Files` folder. As a result, when it was executed from another folder (e.g. from a terminal window opened on the Windows desktop), it would not be able to find the *ResetConfig.txt* file.

From now on, *SLReset.exe* will always use the absolute path `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Files\ResetConfig.txt` when locating *ResetConfig.txt*.

#### Automation: Using the Engine.Sleep method in an Automation script could affect other scripts [ID 40104]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

Up to now, using the *Engine.Sleep* method in an Automation script could cause issues that would affect other scripts. This has now been resolved.

#### SLLogCollector: Enhanced CPU usage when 'Include memory dump' is selected [ID 40109]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, SLLogCollector will now use less CPU resources when you selected the *Include memory dump* option.

#### Failover: Online agent will be restarted at the end of the decommissioning process [ID 40161]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When you decommission a Failover setup, from now on, the DataMiner Agent that was online when you started the decommission process will be restarted as soon as the decommission process has finished.

The DataMiner Agent that was offline when you started the decommission process will, as before, be reset by the factory reset tool *SLReset.exe*.

#### DataMiner startup: Listening for incoming traps will now delayed until SLNet is fully initialized [ID 40162]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

Up to now, listening for incoming traps would start once SLSNMPManager was up and running. In order to reduce the time it takes for DataMiner to start up, listening for incoming traps will now be delayed until SLNet is fully initialized. As a result, SLNet will only be requested to distribute traps once all DataMiner modules are loaded.

#### MySQL.data.dll downgraded to version 8.0.32 to prevent known MySQL issue [ID 40200]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

In order to prevent the following known MySQL issue from occurring, the *Mysql.Data.dll* driver has been downgraded to version 8.0.32.

- [Bug #110789 - OpenAsync throws unhandled exception from thread pool](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=110789)

#### DxMs upgraded [ID 40231] [ID 40254]

<!-- RN 40231: MR 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->
<!-- RN 40254: MR 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

The following DataMiner Extension Modules (DxMs), which are included in the DataMiner upgrade package, have been upgraded to the indicated versions:

- DataMiner CoreGateway: version 2.14.9
- DataMiner SupportAssistant: version 1.6.10

For detailed information about the changes included in those versions, refer to the [DxM release notes](xref:DxM_RNs_index).

#### All Cassandra driver logging will now be stored in the SLCassandraDriver.txt file [ID 40268]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

From now on, all Cassandra driver logging will be stored in the *SLCassandraDriver.txt* file.

> [!NOTE]
> The logging of the SQLite driver, which is used when offloading data to file, will now be stored in the *SLSQLiteDriver.txt* file.

#### DataMiner Object Models: Exception thrown when trying to use unsupported field types will now include the full type name [ID 40339]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

The exception that is thrown when an attempt is made to serialize a DOM instance containing unsupported value types will now include the full type name. The text of the exception will now indicate more clearly which type is not supported.

Example of the former exception:

```txt
System.NotSupportedException: This type of ValueWrapper is not supported (ValueWrapper`1)
```

Example of the new exception:

```txt
System.NotSupportedException: This type of ValueWrapper is not supported (Skyline.DataMiner.Net.Sections.ValueWrapper`1[[Skyline.DataMiner.Net.Apps.DataMinerObjectModel.DomInstanceId, SLNetTypes, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=9789b1eac4cb1b12]])
```

#### SLNetClientTest - DataMiner Object Models: DOM instance overview now shows DOM definition names [ID 40341]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

In the SLNetClientTest tool, you can go to *Advanced > Apps > DataMiner Object Model...* to get a list of all DOM modules. When you drill down to get a list of all DOM objects in a particular module, the first tab shows a subset of the recently updated DOM instances including their ID, their name, and some additional metadata. This view will now have an extra column containing the name of the DOM definitions to which the instances are linked.

> [!WARNING]
> Always be extremely careful when using the SLNetClientTest tool, as it can have far-reaching consequences on the functionality of your DataMiner System.

#### Enhanced CPU usage when storing table rows in EPM environments [ID 40380]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, less CPU resources will now be used when storing table rows in EPM environments.

### Fixes

#### Problem with SLElement while processing table parameter updates [ID 39462]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

In some cases, SLElement could stop working while processing table parameter updates.

#### Alarms generated for an element with a virtual function would incorrectly get exported to that virtual function [ID 39536]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When alarms were generated for an element with a virtual function, those alarms would incorrectly get exported to the virtual function.

#### SLDataGateway: Problem when retrieving data page by page [ID 39581]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When SLDataGateway retrieved data from the database page by page, in some cases, paging handlers that had already fetched all their data and had already been deleted would incorrectly be used, causing exceptions to be thrown.

#### DataMiner Object Models: CRUD events would incorrectly be of type 'DomCrudEvent\<T\>' [ID 39696]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

Events generated after DOM objects were created, updated or deleted would incorrectly be of type `DomCrudEvent<T>` instead of e.g. `DomInstancesChangedEventMessage`.

#### Run-time error could occur in SLProtocol when a large SNMP table was being polled [ID 39756]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

Up to now, when an SNMP table took a long time to be polled, a runtime error could occur in SLProtocol.

To avoid such runtime errors, from now on, when SLSNMPManager is polling an SNMP table, it will send a notification to SLProtocol every minute to indicate that SNMP data is being polled.

#### Failover switch would take significantly longer than usual due to blocking calls in the SLASPConnection process [ID 39769]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

On Failover systems with a Cassandra setup, a Failover switch would take significantly longer than usual due to blocking calls in the SLASPConnection process.

See also: [Failover switch taking a long time on systems with Cassandra setup](xref:KI_Failover_switch_Cassandra)

#### Problem due to the protobuf-net framework in SLNetTypes being initialized on multiple threads [ID 39807]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

On heavily loaded systems, in some cases, the protobuf-net framework in SLNetTypes would simultaneously be initialized on multiple threads, causing the following exception to be thrown:

`Timeout while inspecting metadata; this may indicate a deadlock. This can often be avoided by preparing necessary serializers during application initialization, rather than allowing multiple threads to perform the initial metadata inspection; please also see the LockContended event`

#### Service & Resource Management: Problem when deleting a discrete value of a profile parameter [ID 39867]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When two capability parameters shared the same discrete value, and the value of one of those parameters was included in a resource, up to now, it would not be possible to delete that value for the parameter that was not used.

#### No longer possible to edit a service that had been migrated from one DMA to another within a DMS [ID 39893]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When a service had been migrated from one DataMiner Agent to another within a DataMiner System, it would no longer be possible to edit that service. The messages would incorrectly be sent to the DataMiner Agent that hosted the service previously.

#### Failover: Problem when connecting to an offline agent with a DataMiner Cube that used external authentication [ID 39925]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When you connected to an offline agent in a Failover setup with a DataMiner Cube that used external authentication, an `External authentication failed` error would appear. As a result, it would not be possible to force that offline agent to go online.

#### SLAnalytics: Issues fixed with regard to alarm template monitoring mechanism [ID 39948]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

A number of issues have been fixed with regard to the internal SLAnalytics alarm template monitoring mechanism.

#### SLNet - CloudEndpointManager: Problem at startup when NATS and NAS services were not installed [ID 39980]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

At startup, in some cases, the CloudEndpointManager in SLNet could throw an exception when the NATS and NAS services were not installed.

#### Service & Resource Management: Problem when a DMA did not respond during the midnight sync of the Resource Manager [ID 40021]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When a DMA did not respond during the midnight synchronization (e.g. because the Resource Manager had not been initialized on that DMA), up to now, a nullreference exception would be thrown directly after the error had been logged.

#### Automation scripts could fail due to zero or negative sleep intervals being passed to Engine.Sleep [ID 40084]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

Up to now, an Automation script could fail because a zero or negative sleep interval was passed to the `Engine.Sleep` method. From now on, any zero or negative sleep interval will be ignored.

#### SLProtocol would leak memory when performing an SNMP Set [ID 40112]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

In the following cases, SLProtocol would leak memory:

- When performing an SNMP Set on a cell in a table.

- When performing an SNMP Set on a standalone parameter with part of the OID coming from a different standalone parameter. See the following example:

  `<OID type="complete" id="9901">1.3.6.1.4.1.14014.1.1.1.6.1.1.6.*</OID>`

#### Service & Resource Management: Booking events could be triggered multiple times when a database issue occurred while DataMiner was starting up [ID 40114]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When a database issue occurred while DataMiner was starting up, in some cases, booking events could be triggered multiple times.

#### Problem with SLProtocol when elements with multiple connections were in slow poll mode [ID 40119]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

In some cases, SLProtocol could stop working when elements with multiple connections were in slow poll mode.

#### Problem with SLProtocol when loading a connector with forbidden parameter IDs [ID 40127]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

Up to now, SLProtocol would stop working when it loaded a connector containing parameters with IDs that exceeded the boundaries (see [Reserved parameter IDs](xref:ReservedIDsParameters)).

From now on, SLProtocol will no longer stop working when loading such a connector. However, if any parameters are found with IDs that exceed the boundaries, they will not be loaded.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Change points would incorrectly be generated after an SLAnalytics process restart [ID 40156]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

In some cases, new change points would incorrectly be generated shortly after the SLAnalytics process had been restarted, even though no changes in trend behavior had been detected.

#### Service & Resource Management: Problem when retrieving resources filtered by property [ID 40209]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When a request was sent to a DataMiner Agent to retrieve resources filtered by property, in some cases, the DataMiner Agent would throw a `NullReferenceException` when one of the resources had "null" properties.

#### Problem when NATSMigration called SLKill to stop the NATS service [ID 40271]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When the NATSMigration process called SLKill to stop the NATS service, up to now, SLKill would incorrectly also kill the NATSMigration process.

From now on, SLKill will no longer kill the NATSMigration process when it is asked to kill all processes of which the name starts with "NATS".

#### GQI: Data returned by multiple queries for the same user would incorrectly get mixed [ID 40293]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When multiple GQI queries were run for the same user, using the same data source, and with real-time updates enabled, in some cases, the data returned by those queries would incorrectly get mixed.

#### Video thumbnail of type 'Generic Images' would not be reloaded [ID 40328]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When no proxy was used to show a video thumbnail of type *Generic Images*, in some cases, the specified image would incorrectly not be reloaded at the configured refresh rate.

Example:

```html
http://<DMA IP>/VideoThumbnails/video.htm?type=Generic%20Images&source=<IMG URL>&refresh=5000&proxy=false
```

#### Certain processes could get restarted while DataMiner was being stopped [ID 40337]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

In some rare cases, certain processes could get restarted while DataMiner was being stopped. This would then cause issue when DataMiner was restarted.

#### Progress information updates no longer available during DataMiner upgrade [ID 40348]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

In some cases, it could occur that progress information updates during a DataMiner upgrade were no longer available. This was caused by long timeouts in gRPC connections. These could also trigger a race condition, causing the logic checking for progress updates on the client side to override a successful upgrade event. The timeouts will now occur more quickly, so that a reconnection occurs faster and updates become available again.
