### Enhancements

#### SLLogCollector: Memory dumps will be taken first & new option to skip the BPA tests [ID 43588]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

Each time the *SLLogCollector* tool is run, by default, it will order the *Standalone BPA Executor* tool to execute all BPA tests available in the system. From now on, a checkbox will allow you to have those BPA tests skipped.

Also, when ordered to include memory dumps, up to now, the SLLogCollector tool would first run the BPA tests and collect all logging, and would then take the memory dumps. From now on, it will take the memory dumps first.

#### OPC communication is End of Life [ID 43785]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

From now on, OPC communication should no longer be used in DataMiner connectors. Instead, QActions should be used, for example like in the [Generic OPC Data Access](https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/f2642ea9-9eaa-42f3-880e-816470b06a61) connector.

#### Automation: Engine class now exposes the public property ScriptName [ID 43840]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

From now on, the `Engine` class exposes the public property `ScriptName`.

This means that, in an Automation script, it will now be possible to retrieve the name of that script.

#### PDF reports configured in the Dashboards app can now also be sent if recipients are only specified in the CC and/or BCC fields [ID 43844]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

Up to now, an PDF report configured in the Dashboards app could only be sent if recipients were specified in the *To* field.

From now on, it will also be possible to send PDF reports if recipients are only specified in the *CC* and/or *BCC* fields.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, PDF reports configured in DataMiner Cube still require recipients to be specified in the *To* field.

#### BPA test 'Cube CRL Freeze': Enhanced performance [ID 43854]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance of the the *Cube CRL Freeze* BPA test has increased.

This BPA test will identify client machines and DataMiner Agents without internet access where the DataMiner Cube application experiences a significant freeze during startup. This freeze is caused by the system attempting to verify the application's digital signatures with online Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).

#### DataMiner upgrade: Enhanced warning when an upgrade package cannot be found [ID 43916]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

Up to now, when a DataMiner upgrade package could not be found, the following warning message would appear:

*"WARNING! Upgrade ID [guid] no longer exists"*

This message has now been replaced by the following one:

*"WARNING! Upgrade package with ID [guid] no longer exists"*

#### DxMs upgraded [ID 43961]

<!-- RN 43961: MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

The following DataMiner Extension Modules (DxMs), which are included in the DataMiner upgrade package, have been upgraded to the indicated versions:

- DataMiner Orchestrator 1.8.0

For detailed information about the changes included in those versions, refer to the [DxM release notes](xref:DxM_RNs_index).

### Fixes

#### Parameter or DCF information would become unavailable to remotely hosted elements after a DataMiner connection had been re-established [ID 43765]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

After a DataMiner connection had been re-established (due to e.g. a network issue, a failover switch, etc.), in some rare cases, an issue could occur that would cause parameter or DCF information to be unavailable to remotely hosted elements.

#### SLNet would wait too long before closing a connection [ID 43851]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

In some rare cases, SLNet would incorrectly wait for 2 hours before closing a connection. As a result, SLNet and SLDataMiner would keep a large number of unused connections in memory for too long.

#### Timeout of queries against a Cassandra database was set incorrectly [ID 43912]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

The timeout of queries against a Cassandra database was set incorrectly. This timeout has now been set to 10 minutes.

#### Visual Overview in web apps: Cube running as a service within SLHelper would not load the common server settings from ClientSettings.json [ID 43941]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

Up to now, when DataMiner Cube was running as a service within the SLHelper process, it would not load the common server settings from `C:\Skyline DataMiner\users\ClientSettings.json` when it is unable to retrieve its own user settings.

From now on, regardless of whether DataMiner Cube can retrieve its own user settings, it will load the common server settings from `C:\Skyline DataMiner\users\ClientSettings.json`.

#### Notices regarding incorrect baseline values would no longer be generated when an element was started after being swarmed or migrated [ID 43970]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

When an element that had been swarmed or migrated by means of a DELT package was started up, up to now, the following notices would no longer be generated when incorrect baseline values were found:

- `The fixed value (%g) is invalid. It is lower than nominal value (%g), and in the higher range. This value will not be used for alarm creation.`
- `The fixed value (%g) is invalid. It is higher than nominal value (%g), and in the lower range. This value will not be used for alarm creation.`

These notices will now be generated again.

#### Automation script matrix actions related to swarmed or migrated elements could fail [ID 43971]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

Up to now, after elements had been swarmed or migrated by means of a DELT package, in some cases, Automation script matrix actions associated with those elements could fail.
