### Enhancements

#### SLLogCollector packages will now include nslookup output for hostnames [ID 39526]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.7 -->

From now on, SLLogCollector packages will also include the *nslookup* output for the hostname configured in

- *MaintenanceSettings.xml* (HTTPS) and/or
- *DMS.xml* (Failover).

#### OpenSearch: Enhanced performance of alarm queries [ID 40674]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Alarm filters containing brackets can now be translated to OpenSearch queries. This will considerably improve overall performance of alarm queries against OpenSearch databases.

#### Security enhancements [ID 40684]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### SLPort will now validate SSL/TLS certificates by default [ID 40877]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

In order to enhance secure connector communication, SLPort will now validate SSL/TLS certificates by default.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If you want SLPort to skip the default SSL/TLS certification validation for a particular element, you can set the `InsecureHttps` element to true in the *element.xml* file of that element.
> - If you want SLPort to skip the default SSL/TLS certification validation for all elements sharing the same *protocol.xml* file, you can set the `InsecureHttps` element to true in the `PortSettings` element of the *protocol.xml* file.
> - If you want SLPort to skip the default SSL/TLS certification validation when using multi-threaded HTTP communication, set `requestSettings[6]` to true when building the HTTP request in a QAction. For more information, see [Setting up multi-threaded HTTP communication in a QAction](xref:AdvancedMultiThreadedTimersHttp).

#### NT Notify types NT_ADD_VIEW_NO_LOCK and NT_ADD_VIEWS_NO_LOCK have been deprecated [ID 40928]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

The following NT Notify types have been deprecated:

- NT_ADD_VIEW_NO_LOCK
- NT_ADD_VIEWS_NO_LOCK

#### SLLogCollector: Miscellaneous enhancements [ID 40935]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the SLLogCollector tool:

- SLLogCollector packages will now include:

  - SSL certificates
  - Cube version information
  - Web API version information

- Hostnames will now be resolved via both *nslookup* and `System.Net.Dns.GetHostAddresses`.

#### SLXML: Enhanced error when erroneous XML code is received [ID 40995]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, when SLXML received erroneous XML code, the error message logged in *SLXML.txt* would lose vital information when it was trimmed by SLLog due to the 5120-character error message size limit. The error message in question has now been adapted so that the most important information is found at the beginning.

#### SLLogCollector will no longer be configured by default to collect the log files of the DataAPI DxM [ID 41003]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, SLLogCollector would by default be configured to collect the log files of the DataAPI DxM. From now on, this will no longer be the case. Only when the DataAPI DxM is deployed, will SLLogCollector be configured to collect the log files of said DxM.

#### SLLogCollector will no longer be configured by default to collect the log files of the CommunicationGateway DxM [ID 41004]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, SLLogCollector would by default be configured to collect the log files of the CommunicationGateway DxM. From now on, this will no longer be the case. Only when the CommunicationGateway DxM is deployed, will SLLogCollector be configured to collect the log files of said DxM.

#### DataMiner installer: A progress bar will now be shown during the installation of WSL [ID 41032]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When, while running the DataMiner installer to install a DataMiner Agent, you select the database type "Self-hosted - Local Storage", the installer will automatically install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as this is needed to run a Cassandra database. A progress bar will now be shown during the installation of WSL.

Also, when you select the above-mentioned database type, the following warning message will now be displayed:

`Warning: Selecting this option requires nested virtualization to be enabled on the host machine. Failure to do so will result in the feature not functioning.`

### Fixes

#### StorageModule DcM would not be aware of newly generated DataMiner GUID [ID 39121]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When, at DataMiner start-up, no GUID is present in the `<DataMinerGuid>` element in *DataMiner.xml*, DataMiner will automatically generate one.However, up to now, when a new GUID was generated, the StorageModule DcM would not be aware of it. As a result, DataMiner would fail to start.

From now on, when a new DataMiner GUID is generated, the StorageModule DcM will be restarted to make sure it uses the new GUID.

#### Memory leaks in SLDMS [ID 40287]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

In some cases, SLDMS could leak memory.

#### Problem when trying to access trend statistics on a DataMiner Cube connected via gRPC [ID 40668]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When DataMiner Cube was connected to a DataMiner Agent via gRPC, because of a deserialization issue on the server, it would not be possible to access trend statistics.

#### Problem when DataMiner Agent is named DATAMINER [ID 40743]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

From DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU2]/10.4.5 onwards, when the computer name of a DataMiner server was DATAMINER, the server would no longer function correctly.

> [!TIP]
> See also: Known issue [Problem when DMA server is named DATAMINER](xref:KI_Problem_when_server_name_is_DATAMINER)

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Updates to alarm templates used in alarm template groups could be disregarded [ID 40783]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, when an alarm template used in an alarm template group was updated, and no element was using that template directly, in some cases, SLAnalytics would disregard the update. This could then lead to an incorrect anomaly alarm configuration being applied to elements using the alarm template group and to incorrect focus values being set in the alarms of the elements using the alarm template group.

#### Service & Resource Management: Bookings could incorrectly be saved with a non-existing capacity parameter [ID 40808]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, a booking could incorrectly be saved with a non-existing capacity parameter of which the value was set to zero.

#### Problem with alarm severity of a service not being updated correctly [ID 40840]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

In some cases, the alarm severity of a service would not be updated correctly when, during a row update, both the display key and the monitored value had been changed.

#### Failover: Problem with SLSNMPManager at startup [ID 40883]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a DataMiner Agent that was part of a Failover setup started up, in some cases, SLSNMPManager could stop working.

#### Problem when a DVE or virtual function element was deleted while a subscription was updated [ID 40900]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a DVE element or virtual function element was deleted while a subscription on the parent element or one of the child elements was updated, in some cases, especially when Stream Viewer was open, a run-time error could occur.

#### Incomplete CorrelationDetailsEvent messages after a DMA had reconnected to the DMS [ID 40934]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a DataMiner Agent reconnected to the DataMiner System of which it was a member (e.g. after having been restarted), in some rare cases, *CorrelationDetailsEvent* messages could be incomplete.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Alarm template of DVE parent element would incorrectly be used when monitoring was disabled in the alarm template of the DVE child template [ID 40963]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a DVE child element had an alarm template in which you had configured that a particular parameter should not be monitored while, in the alarm template of the DVE parent element, you had configured anomaly monitoring for that same parameter, up to now, the behavioral anomaly detection mechanism would incorrectly use the alarm template configuration of the DVE parent element. From now on, in these situations, it will use the alarm template configuration of the DVE child element instead.

#### Problem when executing a GQI query after a DMA had been restarted [ID 40975]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a GQI query was executed on a DataMiner System with storage per DMA, and then executed again after a DMA in that DataMiner System had been restarted, it would fail.

#### Service & Resource Management: Caching problem could lead to client applications not getting the updated information [ID 40984]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When an object is updated immediately after being created, in some cases, both the create and the update operation will have the same internal timestamp (i.e. the value stored in the `LastModified` field of the `ITrackLastModified` interface). Due to a caching issue, up to now, this could lead to client applications not getting the updated information.

#### MySQL database optimization task would incorrectly be run on systems with a database other than MySQL [ID 40985]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, a MySQL database optimization task would incorrectly also be run on systems with a database other than MySQL.

#### Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool: Problem when encountering invalid or corrupt row while migrating alarm data [ID 41002]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

In some rare cases, the Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool (*SLCCMigrator.exe*) would throw an error when it encountered an invalid or corrupt row in the source database while migrating alarm data. From now on, all invalid or corrupt rows will be skipped.

#### Element connections: Value of write parameters would incorrectly be resent [ID 41010]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When an element connection had a write parameter as source, up to now, the value of that parameter would be pushed to the destination when the element connections of the source element were modified or when the destination element was restarted. In some cases, this could result in unexpected behavior. For example, when the write parameter was a button, the destination element would start to execute the actions as if the button would have been pressed. From now on, write parameters used as source will only be forwarded to the destination when their value is actually updated.

The behavior of read parameters used as source will remain unchanged. Their value will still be forwarded to the destination when the destination element is restarted or when the element connections of the source element are modified. Read parameters are typically used to display the same value in both source and destination.

Also, up to now, when an element connection was saved without the *Include Element State* option being selected, the destination parameter (read parameter) would incorrectly be triggered twice with the same value. From now on, the value will only be forwarded once.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want write parameters used as source to behave as before, you can enable the *LegacyElementConnectionsResendWriteParams* soft-launch option.

#### GQI would no longer be able to send user-friendly error messages to client applications [ID 41019]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Since DataMiner feature version 10.3.9, SLHelper would wrap GQI exceptions incorrectly, causing GQI to no longer be able to send user-friendly error messages to client applications.

#### Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool: Options for offloading files to a file cache would incorrectly not be preserved [ID 41055]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, when finalizing a migration, the Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool (*SLCCMigrator.exe*) would incorrectly not preserve the options that had been specified for offloading files to a file cache. These options will now be preserved.

For more information on the above-mentioned offload options, see [Offloading files to a file cache](xref:DB_xml#offloading-files-to-a-file-cache).

#### Problem with the NATS cluster configuration after a DataMiner start-up [ID 41072]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

After a DataMiner start-up, in some cases, the NATS cluster would be configured incorrectly and the following error message would be added to the *SLError.txt* log file:

`ResetLocalNatsCluster|ERR|0|18|System.IO.InvalidDataException: Central Directory corrupt. ---> System.IO.IOException: An attempt was made to move the position before the beginning of the stream.`

#### Protocols: Stuffing attribute of Protocol.Advanced element was not parsed correctly [ID 41092]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

The value of the `stuffing` attribute of the *Protocol.Advanced* element was not parsed correctly.

#### Enhanced exception handling in SLDMS, SLASPConnection and SLWatchdog [ID 41121]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to SLDMS, SLASPConnection and SLWatchdog with regard to exception handling.

#### DataMiner as a Service: Incorrect 'This DataMiner Agent is not licensed' message [ID 41130]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.11 [CU0] -->

On DaaS systems, in some cases, the online license check could fail, causing client apps (e.g. DataMiner Cube) to incorrectly show a "This DataMiner Agent is not licensed" message.
