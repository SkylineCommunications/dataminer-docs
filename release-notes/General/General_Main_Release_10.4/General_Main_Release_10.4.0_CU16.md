### Enhancements

#### BrokerGateway will now reconfigure the NATS cluster before a DMA is added to or removed from the DMS [ID 42494]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

From now on, when BrokerGateway detects that a DataMiner Agent is about to be added to or removed from a DataMiner System, it will reconfigure the NATS cluster before the DataMiner Agent is actually added or removed.

Similarly, when BrokerGateway detects that a DataMiner Agent is about to be added to a Failover setup, it will reconfigure the NATS cluster before the DataMiner Agent is actually added.

> [!NOTE]
> When BrokerGateway fails to reconfigure the NATS cluster, the DataMiner Agent will not be added or removed.

#### DataMiner upgrade: ModuleInstaller upgrade action timeout has been increased to 30 minutes [ID 42659]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

Up to now, the ModuleInstaller upgrade action would time out after 15 minutes. As this action typically runs for more than 15 minutes, this would ofter cause a notice to be logged.

From now on, the ModuleInstaller upgrade action will only time out after 30 minutes.

#### Visual Overview in the web apps: Enhanced behavior in case of a failing visual overview request [ID 42677]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

When a request for a visual overview in a web app failed, up to now, that request would incorrectly not be removed, causing it to block all subsequent requests for a visual overview in a web app. From now on, when a request for a visual overview in a web app fails, it will be removed from the list of pending requests.

#### Enhanced processing of service deletions [ID 42754]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

When a service was migrated from one DMA to another within the same DMS, in some cases, the service would be deleted by the DMA that hosted the service originally instead of the DMA that was hosting the service when it was migrated. This could potentially lead to issues within the cluster.

From now on, the message ordering the deletion of a service will always be sent to the DMA that is hosting the service. That DMA will then forward the message to the other DMAs within the cluster.

#### Security Advisory BPA test: Enhancements [ID 42850] [ID 42914]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the *Security Advisory* BPA test.

For example, the BPA test is now able to run on the offline agent of a Failover setup.

Also, when the BPA test is run on a system with a local Cassandra or Elasticsearch database, a notice will now appear, saying that a local Cassandra/Indexing setup is no longer recommended.

### Fixes

#### DataMiner upgrade: Folder to which the contents of the upgrade package had been extracted would not be removed [ID 41393]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 - FR 10.5.1 -->

When a DataMiner Agent had been upgraded, in some cases, the folder to which the contents of the upgrade package had been extracted would incorrectly not be removed.

#### SLNet could leak memory when the progress.log file was deleted after a DataMiner upgrade [ID 42040]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

In some cases, the SLNet process could leak memory when the *progress.log* file was deleted after a DataMiner upgrade had been performed.

#### Not all DCF interfaces would be listed in the Connectivity tab of an element's Properties window [ID 42591]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

When, in e.g. DataMiner Cube, you opened the *Connectivity* tab in the *Properties* window of an element, in some rare cases, not all DCF interfaces would be listed.

#### LDAP users added as part of an LDAP user group would incorrectly appear as local users instead of domain users [ID 42743]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

Up to now, LDAP users who had been added to DataMiner as part of an LDAP user group would incorrectly appear as local users instead of domain users.

#### Problem with SLNet caused by 'DefaultUpgradeOptions' element in MaintenanceSettings.xml file [ID 42746]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

When, in the *MaintenanceSettings.xml* file, the `<SLNet>` element contained a `<DefaultUpgradeOptions>` sub-element, up to now, SLNet would fail to start up correctly.

> [!NOTE]
> The above-mentioned `<DefaultUpgradeOptions>` element will be added to the *MaintenanceSettings.xml* file the first time you make any changes to the default upgrade options. To change these options in DataMiner Cube, go to *System Center > System Settings > Upgrade*.

#### Problem with SLNet and/or SLHelper when the NATS connection between them was unavailable [ID 42755]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

When the NATS connection between SLNet and SLHelper was unavailable, in some cases, either of those processes could stop working.

#### Problem when deleting a newly created service that had failed to load [ID 42775]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

When a service was created, in some cases, loading that new service would fail, even though a *service.xml* file had correctly been added on disk.Moreover, deleting that service would also fail, making it impossible to create a new service with an identical name.

From now on, when a new service fails to load, additional logging will be added, and a backup *service.xml* file will be created in the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Recycle Bin\` folder for debugging purposes.

Also, when the service that failed to load is deleted, an attempt will be made to delete the files and folders associated with that service in order to prevent any subsequent issues when creating a new service with an identical name.

#### SLSNMPManager process responsible for SNMPv3 communication could disappear when it was not able to redirect a trap [ID 42888]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

By default, an SLSNMPManager process responsible for SNMPv3 communication will listen for any incoming traps, and will forward, for example, SNMPv2 traps to the SLSNMPManager process responsible for SNMPv2 communication.

Up to now, when an SLSNMPManager process responsible for SNMPv3 communication was not able to communicate with the SLSNMPManager process to which it had to redirect a trap, in some cases, the process could stop working and disappear.

#### Failover: Online agent would not clear local information about elements, services, and redundancy groups from its event cache when going offline [ID 42890]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

When, during a Failover switch, the online agent went offline, up to now, it would incorrectly not clear local information about elements, services, and redundancy groups from its event cache.

#### Incorrect attempts to delete child DVE elements upon start or restart of a main DVE element [ID 42924]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

When a main DVE element was started or restarted, up to now, an attempt would incorrectly be made to delete child DVE elements that had already been deleted, causing unnecessary information events like "Deleting element-connections for source..." to be generated.

#### Automation: Associated TXF files would not be removed when an Automation script was deleted [ID 42943]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

When you create an Automation script, apart from an XML file containing the actual script, a number of TXF files will be created. These will contain cached query information to speed up XML querying. Up to now, when an Automation script was deleted, the associated TXF files would incorrectly not be removed.

#### Changes to LDAP users or LDAP groups would incorrectly not get synchronized among the DMAs in the cluster [ID 42950]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

Up to now, changes to an LDAP user or an LDAP group would incorrectly not get synchronized among the DMAs in the cluster, not even after a midnight sync.
