- [Default number of simultaneously running SLProtocol processes has been increased from 5 to 10 [ID 41077]](#default-number-of-simultaneously-running-slprotocol-processes-has-been-increased-from-5-to-10-id-41077)

## New features

#### DataMiner Agent will no longer restart when an SLProtocol process crashes [ID 40335]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, when an SLProtocol process disappeared, the DataMiner Agent would restart. From now on, when an SLProtocol process disappears, a new SLProtocol process will be started and all elements that were hosted by the process that disappeared will now be hosted by the newly created process. However, as all parameter data in the SLProtocol process that disappeared is lost, all affected elements will be restarted. Also, a notice alarm will be created with the following value:

`Process disappearance of SLProtocol.exe with PID <processId>; <x> elements hosted by the disappeared process have been restarted.`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When an SLProtocol process disappears, typically, a crashdump will also be created. It is highly recommended to ask [Skyline TechSupport](mailto:techsupport@skyline.be) to investigate that crashdump so that future SLProtocol disappearances and subsequent element restarts can be prevented.

In the *SLElementInProtocol.txt* log file, the following fields have been added:

- *NormalStart*/*SLProtocolCrashRestart* will indicate whether the element was started by a start action or due to an SLProtocol process disappearance.
- The number of times the element was started by a normal start action since the DataMiner Agent was started.
- The number of times the element was started due to an SLProtocol process disappearance.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The process ID of the new SLProtocol process can be found in the *elementName.txt* log file, while the process ID of the old SLProtocol process can be found in the *elementName_BAK.txt* log file.
> - There will be a delay of one minute between the disappearance of an SLProtocol process and the creation of a new SLProtocol process.

#### Interactive Automation scripts: New option to skip the confirmation window when aborting [ID 40683]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

`UIBuilder` now has a new `SkipAbortConfirmation` property. When set to true, the confirmation window will not be displayed when the interactive Automation script is aborted. By default, this property will be set to false.

Example:

```csharp
UIBuilder uib = new UIBuilder();
uib.SkipAbortConfirmation = true;
```

> [!TIP]
> See also: [Interactive Automation scripts: New option to skip the confirmation window when aborting [ID 40720]](xref:Cube_Feature_Release_10.4.12#interactive-automation-scripts-new-option-to-skip-the-confirmation-window-when-aborting-id-40720)

#### Trending - Proactive cap detection: Generating an alarm when a parameter is expected to cross a particular alarm threshold or be outside a set range [ID 41017]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

The proactive cap detection feature is now able to generate an alarm when it expects that the value of the parameter will soon cross a particular alarm threshold or be outside a set range.

For more information on how to use this new feature in DataMiner Cube, see [Alarm templates - 'Anomaly alarm settings' window: New option to generate an alarm when a parameter is expected to cross a particular alarm threshold or be outside a set range [ID 40837] [ID 41109]](xref:Cube_Feature_Release_10.4.12#alarm-templates---anomaly-alarm-settings-window-new-option-to-generate-an-alarm-when-a-parameter-is-expected-to-cross-a-particular-alarm-threshold-or-be-outside-a-set-range-id-40837-id-41109)

#### SLNetClientTest tool now allows you to query the hint paths used to look up QAction dependencies [ID 41068]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

In order to improve troubleshooting assembly resolution issues, the SLNetClientTest tool now allows you to query the hint paths used to look up QAction dependencies.

Also, SLManagedScripting will now add an entry in the *SLManagedScripting.txt* log file each time it has loaded or failed to load an assembly. This log entry will include both the requested version and the actual version of the assembly.

To see the current hint paths per SLScripting process, do the following:

1. Open the SLNetClientTest tool.
1. Go to *Diagnostics > DMA > SLScripting AssemblyResolve HintPaths*.

> [!CAUTION]
> Always be extremely careful when using the *SLNetClientTest* tool, as it can have far-reaching consequences on the functionality of your DataMiner System.

## Changes

### Breaking changes

#### Automation: SubScriptOptions.SkipStartedInfoEvent will now by default be set to true [ID 40867]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

If you have created an Automation script that launches subscripts, you can use the `SkipStartedInfoEvent` option to specify whether "Script started" information events should be generated for the subscripts or not.

Up to now, this `SkipStartedInfoEvent` option would by default be set to false. From now on, it will by default be set to true.

### Enhancements

#### DataMiner Object Models: Length of string fields is now limited in order to prevent database errors [ID 39496]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

Values of DOM fields of type `String` are now limited to 32,766 UTF8 bytes.

When a DOM instance contains string fields of which the value exceeds this limit, a `DomInstanceError` will be returned with error reason *ValueTooLarge*. The `AssociatedFields` collection will contain the SectionDefinition, Section and FieldDescriptor IDs referring to the incorrect FieldValue as well as the new `ActualSize` property, which will contain the actual UTF8 size of the string that exceeds the limit.  

#### OpenSearch: Enhanced performance of alarm queries [ID 40674]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Alarm filters containing brackets can now be translated to OpenSearch queries. This will considerably improve overall performance of alarm queries against OpenSearch databases.

#### VerifyDotNetVersion prerequisite check now returns the missing .NET version and a link to the download page [ID 40677]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

When you run the DataMiner installer or install a DataMiner upgrade package, the *VerifyDotNetVersion* prerequisite check will verify whether Microsoft ASP.NET 8.0 is installed. When this is not the case, the installation or upgrade will be aborted and a pop-up window will appear, showing the following message:

*Please install the latest \"ASP.NET Core Runtime hosting bundle\" for .NET 8.0 from [https://aka.ms/dotnet/download](https://aka.ms/dotnet/download)*

#### Security enhancements [ID 40684]

#### PortLog.txt file now supports IPv6 addresses [ID 40753]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

In the *PortLog.txt* file, you can specify IP addresses of DataMiner elements for which log information has to be added to the *SLPort.txt* log file.

In this *PortLog.txt* file, it is now possible to specify IPv6 addresses as well as IPv4 addresses.

#### STaaS: Enhanced performance when writing data to the database [ID 40870]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, on STaaS systems, overall performance has increased when writing data to the database.

#### SLPort will now validate SSL/TLS certificates by default [ID 40877]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

In order to enhance secure connector communication, SLPort will now validate SSL/TLS certificates by default.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If you want SLPort to skip the default SSL/TLS certification validation for a particular element, you can set the `InsecureHttps` element to true in the *element.xml* file of that element.
> - If you want SLPort to skip the default SSL/TLS certification validation for all elements sharing the same *protocol.xml* file, you can set the `InsecureHttps` element to true in the `PortSettings` element of the *protocol.xml* file.
> - If you want SLPort to skip the default SSL/TLS certification validation when using multi-threaded HTTP communication, set `requestSettings[6]` to true when building the HTTP request in a QAction. For more information, see [Setting up multi-threaded HTTP communication in a QAction](xref:AdvancedMultiThreadedTimersHttp).

#### SLAnalytics - Time-scoped relations: Menu will now show more related parameters [ID 40904]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

When, after selecting a section of a trend graph showing trend information for a particular parameter, you clicked the light bulb icon, up to now, a menu would open, showing the other parameters of the same element that were related to the parameter shown in the graph.

From now on, the menu will no longer only show all parameters of the same element that were related in the selected time range. It will now also show

- all parameters of the other elements in the same service that were related in the selected time range, and
- the top 10 parameters system-wide that were related in the selected time range.

#### Certain information events will no longer be generated when an element is replicated [ID 40926]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

When an element is replicated, the following information events will no longer be generated:

- [Replicated Element]
- [Remote Element Name]
- [Remote DMA IP]

#### NT Notify types NT_ADD_VIEW_NO_LOCK and NT_ADD_VIEWS_NO_LOCK have been deprecated [ID 40928]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

The following NT Notify types have been deprecated:

- NT_ADD_VIEW_NO_LOCK
- NT_ADD_VIEWS_NO_LOCK

#### Failover: Enhanced updating of values stored in the C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Configurations\\ClusterEndpoints.json file based on current system status [ID 40930]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

A number of enhancements have been made with regard to updating values stored in the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Configurations\\ClusterEndpoints.json* file based on current system status.

#### SLLogCollector: Miscellaneous enhancements [ID 40935]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the SLLogCollector tool:

- SLLogCollector packages will now include:

  - SSL certificates
  - Cube version information
  - Web API version information

- Hostnames will now be resolved via both *nslookup* and `System.Net.Dns.GetHostAddresses`.

#### GQI: Enhanced performance of 'top X' queries using the 'Get alarms' data source [ID 40937]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance of GQI "top X" queries using the *Get alarms* data source has increased.

#### Service & Resource Management: Controlling the generation of information events when starting booking event scripts [ID 40972]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, when a booking event script was executed, an information event would automatically be generated to indicate that a script had been executed. This information event had the description "Script started" and its value contained the name of the script.

From now on, these information events will no longer be generated unless the `ShowScriptStartEventInfo,` option is set to true in the ResourceManager configuration.

Also, the following scripts will now only be executed when the above-mentioned option is set to true:

- the *StateChangeScript*, defined on an `SRMServiceInfo` object, which is executed when the state of the `SRMServiceInfo` object changes.
- the *SRM_QuarantineHandling* script, which is executed when there is a conflict with a booking causing that booking to be put in quarantine.

Additionally, the following script will also no longer generate an information event when it is executed:

- the *UpdateBookingConfigByReferenceScript* script, defined in the `ProfileHelper` configuration, which is executed when the `UpdateAndApply` method of the `ProfileInstances` class is run successfully.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `ShowScriptStartEventInfo,` option is not synchronized among the DataMiner Agents in a DMS. It has to be set on every individual DataMiner Agent.

#### SLXML: Enhanced error when erroneous XML code is received [ID 40995]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, when SLXML received erroneous XML code, the error message logged in *SLXML.txt* would lose vital information when it was trimmed by SLLog due to the 5120-character error message size limit. The error message in question has now been adapted so that the most important information is found at the beginning.

#### SLLogCollector will no longer be configured by default to collect the log files of the DataAPI DxM [ID 41003]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, SLLogCollector would by default be configured to collect the log files of the DataAPI DxM. From now on, this will no longer be the case. Only when the DataAPI DxM is deployed, will SLLogCollector be configured to collect the log files of said DxM.

#### SLLogCollector will no longer be configured by default to collect the log files of the CommunicationGateway DxM [ID 41004]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, SLLogCollector would by default be configured to collect the log files of the CommunicationGateway DxM. From now on, this will no longer be the case. Only when the CommunicationGateway DxM is deployed, will SLLogCollector be configured to collect the log files of said DxM.

#### Web apps - Visual Overview: Default page will now be the first page that has not been set to 'hidden' [ID 41013]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

For visual overviews in web apps (e.g. Monitoring, Dashboards, etc.), up to now, the default page would always be the first page, regardless of whether that page had been set to "hidden" or not. From now on, the default page will be the first page that has not been set to "hidden".

#### DataMiner installer: A progress bar will now be shown during the installation of WSL [ID 41032]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When, while running the DataMiner installer to install a DataMiner Agent, you select the database type "Self-hosted - Local Storage", the installer will automatically install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as this is needed to run a Cassandra database. A progress bar will now be shown during the installation of WSL.

Also, when you select the above-mentioned database type, the following warning message will now be displayed:

`Warning: Selecting this option requires nested virtualization to be enabled on the host machine. Failure to do so will result in the feature not functioning.`

#### SLManagedAutomation and SLManagedScripting will now use at least TLS 1.2 encryption when communicating with BrokerGateway [ID 41048]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

When initialized, SLManagedAutomation and SLManagedScripting will now set the allowed security protocol to "Tls1 | Tls11 | Tls12".

This will ensure that SLManagedAutomation and SLManagedScripting are capable of communicating with BrokerGateway and other HTTP APIs that reject anything below TLS 1.2.

#### Notification message templates: New [treeid] placeholder [ID 41052]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

When defining a notification message template in the *NotifyTemplates.xml* file, you can use the [treeid] placeholder.

This placeholder will be replaced by the tree ID of the alarm.

For more information, see [Customizing the layout of notification messages](xref:Customizing_the_layout_of_notification_messages)

#### Default number of simultaneously running SLProtocol processes has been increased from 5 to 10 [ID 41077]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

The number of simultaneously running SLProtocol processes can be set in the `<ProcessOptions>` tag of the *DataMiner.xml* file.

Up to now, the number of simultaneously running processes was by default set to 5. From now on, this number will by default be set to 10.

#### Service & Resource Management: More detailed logging when an error occurs while a booking is being created [ID 41168]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, when an error occurred while a booking is being created, in some cases, the entry added to the *SLResourceManager.txt* log file would contain insufficient information about the reason why the error had occurred. From now on, this log entry will contain more detailed information.

### Fixes

#### StorageModule DcM would not be aware of newly generated DataMiner GUID [ID 39121]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When, at DataMiner start-up, no GUID is present in the `<DataMinerGuid>` element in *DataMiner.xml*, DataMiner will automatically generate one.However, up to now, when a new GUID was generated, the StorageModule DcM would not be aware of it. As a result, DataMiner would fail to start.

From now on, when a new DataMiner GUID is generated, the StorageModule DcM will be restarted to make sure it uses the new GUID.

#### Memory leaks in SLDMS [ID 40287]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

In some cases, SLDMS could leak memory.

#### SLNet: Problem when internal and external authentication were used within the same DMS [ID 40635]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->

When, in a DataMiner System, some agents used external authentication while other agents used internal authentication, in some rare cases, the SLNet error "SSPI.DLL is no longer supported" could be thrown on certain agents.

#### Problem when trying to access trend statistics on a DataMiner Cube connected via gRPC [ID 40668]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When DataMiner Cube was connected to a DataMiner Agent via gRPC, because of a deserialization issue on the server, it would not be possible to access trend statistics.

#### Problem when DataMiner Agent is named DATAMINER [ID 40743]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

From DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU2]/10.4.5 onwards, when the computer name of a DataMiner server was DATAMINER, the server would no longer function correctly.

> [!TIP]
> See also: Known issue [Problem when DMA server is named DATAMINER](xref:KI_Problem_when_server_name_is_DATAMINER)

#### Problem when requesting alarm details for DELT elements via legacy references [ID 40747]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->
<!-- Not added to MR 10.5.0 - Introduced by RN 40089 -->

Since DataMiner feature release 10.4.10, requesting alarm details for DELT elements via legacy [hosting DMA ID]/[root alarm ID] references would not work as expected.

`GetAlarmDetailsMessage` and `GetAlarmTreeMessage` have now been updated.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Updates to alarm templates used in alarm template groups could be disregarded [ID 40783]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, when an alarm template used in an alarm template group was updated, and no element was using that template directly, in some cases, SLAnalytics would disregard the update. This could then lead to an incorrect anomaly alarm configuration being applied to elements using the alarm template group and to incorrect focus values being set in the alarms of the elements using the alarm template group.

#### Service & Resource Management: Bookings could incorrectly be saved with a non-existing capacity parameter [ID 40808]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, a booking could incorrectly be saved with a non-existing capacity parameter of which the value was set to zero.

#### Problem with alarm severity of a service not being updated correctly [ID 40840]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

In some cases, the alarm severity of a service would not be updated correctly when, during a row update, both the display key and the monitored value had been changed.

#### Failover: Problem with SLSNMPManager at startup [ID 40883]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a DataMiner Agent that was part of a Failover setup started up, in some cases, SLSNMPManager could stop working.

#### Problem when a DVE or virtual function element was deleted while a subscription was updated [ID 40900]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a DVE element or virtual function element was deleted while a subscription on the parent element or one of the child elements was updated, in some cases, especially when Stream Viewer was open, a run-time error could occur.

#### Incomplete CorrelationDetailsEvent messages after a DMA had reconnected to the DMS [ID 40934]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a DataMiner Agent reconnected to the DataMiner System of which it was a member (e.g. after having been restarted), in some rare cases, *CorrelationDetailsEvent* messages could be incomplete.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Alarm template of DVE parent element would incorrectly be used when monitoring was disabled in the alarm template of the DVE child template [ID 40963]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a DVE child element had an alarm template in which you had configured that a particular parameter should not be monitored while, in the alarm template of the DVE parent element, you had configured anomaly monitoring for that same parameter, up to now, the behavioral anomaly detection mechanism would incorrectly use the alarm template configuration of the DVE parent element. From now on, in these situations, it will use the alarm template configuration of the DVE child element instead.

#### Problem when executing a GQI query after a DMA had been restarted [ID 40975]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a GQI query was executed on a DataMiner System with storage per DMA, and then executed again after a DMA in that DataMiner System had been restarted, it would fail.

#### Service & Resource Management: Caching problem could lead to client applications not getting the updated information [ID 40984]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When an object is updated immediately after being created, in some cases, both the create and the update operation will have the same internal timestamp (i.e. the value stored in the `LastModified` field of the `ITrackLastModified` interface). Due to a caching issue, up to now, this could lead to client applications not getting the updated information.

#### MySQL database optimization task would incorrectly be run on systems with a database other than MySQL [ID 40985]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, a MySQL database optimization task would incorrectly also be run on systems with a database other than MySQL.

#### Unclear exception returned by paged query after encountering a timeout [ID 40986]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->
<!-- Not added to MR 10.5.0 - Introduced by RN 40614 -->

When a paged query encountered a timeout during execution, in some cases, it would return an unclear exception. The text of the exception has now been made clearer.

#### Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool: Problem when encountering invalid or corrupt row while migrating alarm data [ID 41002]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

In some rare cases, the Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool (*SLCCMigrator.exe*) would throw an error when it encountered an invalid or corrupt row in the source database while migrating alarm data. From now on, all invalid or corrupt rows will be skipped.

#### Element connections: Value of write parameters would incorrectly be resent [ID 41010]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When an element connection had a write parameter as source, up to now, the value of that parameter would be pushed to the destination when the element connections of the source element were modified or when the destination element was restarted. In some cases, this could result in unexpected behavior. For example, when the write parameter was a button, the destination element would start to execute the actions as if the button would have been pressed. From now on, write parameters used as source will only be forwarded to the destination when their value is actually updated.

The behavior of read parameters used as source will remain unchanged. Their value will still be forwarded to the destination when the destination element is restarted or when the element connections of the source element are modified. Read parameters are typically used to display the same value in both source and destination.

Also, up to now, when an element connection was saved without the *Include Element State* option being selected, the destination parameter (read parameter) would incorrectly be triggered twice with the same value. From now on, the value will only be forwarded once.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want write parameters used as source to behave as before, you can enable the *LegacyElementConnectionsResendWriteParams* soft-launch option.

#### GQI would no longer be able to send user-friendly error messages to client applications [ID 41019]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Since DataMiner feature version 10.3.9, SLHelper would wrap GQI exceptions incorrectly, causing GQI to no longer be able to send user-friendly error messages to client applications.

#### Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool: Options for offloading files to a file cache would incorrectly not be preserved [ID 41055]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, when finalizing a migration, the Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool (*SLCCMigrator.exe*) would incorrectly not preserve the options that had been specified for offloading files to a file cache. These options will now be preserved.

For more information on the above-mentioned offload options, see [Offloading files to a file cache](xref:DB_xml#offloading-files-to-a-file-cache).

#### Problem with the NATS cluster configuration after a DataMiner start-up [ID 41072]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

After a DataMiner start-up, in some cases, the NATS cluster would be configured incorrectly and the following error message would be added to the *SLError.txt* log file:

`ResetLocalNatsCluster|ERR|0|18|System.IO.InvalidDataException: Central Directory corrupt. ---> System.IO.IOException: An attempt was made to move the position before the beginning of the stream.`

#### No longer possible to send a SetAlarmStateMessage for an alarm if the associated element had been imported via a DELT package [ID 41074]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.12 -->
<!-- Not added to MR 10.5.0 - Introduced by RN 39193 -->
