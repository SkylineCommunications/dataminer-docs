### Enhancements

#### SLAnalytics: Alarms and suggestion events for virtual functions will now be generated on the parent element [ID_39707]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

When, in the scope of behavioral anomaly detection, proactive cap detection or pattern matching, SLAnalytics has to generate alarms or suggestion events for virtual functions, from now on, it will generate them on the parent element. However, it will continue to generate alarms and suggestion events for all other kinds of DVEs on the child element.

#### MessageBroker: Clients will now first attempt to connect via the local NATS node [ID_39727]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.9 -->

From now on, when a client connects to the DataMiner System, an attempt will first be made to connect to the NATs bus via the local NATS node. Only when this attempt fails, will the client connect to the NATS bus via another node.

#### Service & Resource Management: Changing the cache settings of the Resource Manager without restarting DataMiner [ID_39795]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.9 -->

The ResourceManager configuration contains settings that limit the numbers of items that will be cached. These settings have now been updated:

| Setting | Former value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| IdCacheConfiguration-MaxObjectsInCache        | 500  | 10000 |
| TimeRangeCacheConfiguration-MaxObjectsInCache | 3000 | 50000 |

Also, from now on, it will be possible to change these settings without having to restart DataMiner.

To do so, send a `ResourceManagerConfigInfoMessage` containing an `IdCacheConfiguration`, a `TimeRangeCacheConfiguration`, or a `HostedReservationInstanceCacheConfiguration`. Only when the `CleanupCheckInterval` (in case of `TimeRangeCacheConfiguration`) or `CheckInterval` (in case of `HostedReservationInstanceCacheConfiguration`) property has been changed, should the ResourceManager be reinitialized.

See the following example:

```csharp
var request = new ResourceManagerConfigInfoMessage(ResourceManagerConfigInfoMessage.ConfigInfoType.Set)
{
    StorageSettings = new StorageSettings(ResourceStorageType.Elastic),
    IdCacheConfiguration = new IdCacheConfiguration()
    {
        MaxObjectsInCache = 5000,
        ObjectsLifeSpan = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10)
    },
    TimeRangeCacheConfiguration = new TimeRangeCacheConfiguration()
    {
        CleanupCheckInterval = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10),
        MaxObjectsInCache = 5000,
        TimeRangeLifeSpan = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10)
    },
    HostedReservationInstanceCacheConfiguration = new HostedReservationInstanceCacheConfiguration()
    {
        CheckInterval = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10),
        InitialLoadDays = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10)
    }
};
var response = _engine.SendSLNetSingleResponseMessage(request) as ResourceManagerConfigInfoResponseMessage;
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Sending a `ResourceManagerConfigInfoMessage` to a DataMiner Agent will only update the cache settings of that specific agent. If you want to update the settings of all agents in the cluster, you will have to sent a `ResourceManagerConfigInfoMessage` to every agent in that cluster.
> - To retrieve the above-mentioned settings, you can send a `ResourceManagerConfigInfoMessage` of type `Get`.

#### When stopping, native processes will only wait for 30 seconds to close the MessageBroker connection when necessary [ID_39863]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.9 -->

When a native process (e.g. SLDataMiner) is stopping, it will by default wait for 30 seconds before it closes the MessageBroker connection.

However, in some rare cases, there is no need to wait for 30 seconds. In those cases, the MessageBroker connection will be closed immediately.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Enhanced detection of change points of type 'flatline' [ID_39898]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.9 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the algorithm that detects change points of type "flatline".

When the trend data of a parameter appears to have frequent flatline periods, the chance of a flatline change point being detected and a suggestion event being created for it has now decreased.

Also, a parameter will need to have had at least one day of fluctuating trend data behavior before the flatline detection functionality will detect the start of a flatline period.

#### DataMiner upgrade: ResetConfig.txt will no longer be added to FilesToDelete.txt [ID_39994]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

Every DataMiner upgrade package includes a *FilesToDelete.txt* file, which lists all files in the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\* folder that should be deleted during the upgrade procedure. From now on, the *ResetConfig.txt* file will no longer be added to that list of files to be deleted.

The *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Files\\ResetConfig.txt* file is a file used by the factory reset tool *SLReset.exe* as a whitelist to determine which files to keep. The first time *SLReset.exe* is executed, the default whitelist is added to *ResetConfig.txt*. Afterwards, you can add files you want to keep to this whitelist, so that these are not removed when the tool is executed again. If you delete *ResetConfig.txt*, the default whitelist will be used again.

#### Storage as a Service: Event hub throttling errors will now be logged as 'Warning' instead of 'Error' [ID_40018]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

From now on, event hub throttling errors will be logged as 'Warning' instead of 'Error'.

### Fixes

#### Problem with SLElement while processing table parameter updates [ID_39462]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.9 -->

In some cases, SLElement could stop working while processing table parameter updates.

#### SLNet - CloudEndpointManager: Problem at startup when NATS and NAS services were not installed [ID_39980]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

At startup, in some cases, the CloudEndpointManager in SLNet could throw an exception when the NATS and NAS services were not installed.

#### Service & Resource Management: Problem when a DMA did not respond during the midnight sync of the Resource Manager [ID_40021]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.9 -->

When a DMA did not respond during the midnight synchronization (e.g. because the Resource Manager had not been initialized on that DMA), up to now, a nullreference exception would be thrown directly after the error had been logged.
