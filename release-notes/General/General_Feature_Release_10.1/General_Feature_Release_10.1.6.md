## New features

### DMS core functionality

#### New alarm table field on MySQL and SQL Server databases: ExtraStatusId \[ID 29374\]

On MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server databases, the alarm table now has an extra field of type BIGINT: ExtraStatusId.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - This change will cause a small increase in latency when retrieving alarms from the database.
> - From now on, using a filter with an AlarmFilterItemExtraStatus in the GetAlarmDetailsFromDbMessage from within an Automation script will not work correctly in conjunction with a MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server database.

#### SimulationHelper API now allows loading, enabling and disabling element simulations at runtime \[ID 29517\]

Up to now, loading new element simulations always required a DataMiner restart. Now, the SimulationHelper API will allow you to load, enable and disable element simulations at runtime from within protocol QActions or Automation scripts.

Construction:

```csharp
SimulationHelper(Func<DMSMessage[], DMSMessage[]> messageHandler)
```

- Loading all simulation files stored in the C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Simulations folder of a specified DMA

    ```csharp
    void LoadSimulations(int dataMinerId)
    ```

- Enabling an element simulation

    ```csharp
    void EnableSimulation(int hostingDataMinerId, int dataMinerId, int elementId)
    ```

- Disabling an element simulation

    ```csharp
    void DisableSimulation(int hostingDataMinerId, int dataMinerId, int elementId)
    ```

Example on how to use this in an Automation script:

```csharp
var simulationHelper = new SimulationHelper(Engine.SLNet.SendMessages);
simulationHelper.LoadSimulations();
```

#### Alarm storm mode for clearable alarms \[ID 29637\]

A protection has been added to avoid reduced performance of the system when an alarm storm happens that causes there to be a large number of clearable alarms at the same time. By default, when there are more than 1000 clearable alarm trees on a DMA, the newly generated clearable alarms will be closed instead of clearable. Once the number of clearable alarm trees has dropped to less than 100, this protection mode is lifted and newly generated alarms will be clearable again.

> [!NOTE]
> In DataMiner.xml, you can customize the above-mentioned default values for the minimum and maximum threshold with the min and max attributes of the DataMiner.ClearableAlarmStormProtection tag.
>
> If you change these settings, you must do so on every DMA in a cluster, as they are not automatically synchronized.

### DMS Protocols

#### DataMiner Connectivity Framework: DCF interfaces can now be marked internal \[ID 29326\] \[ID 29438\]

In an element protocol, it is now possible to make a distinction between

- internal DCF interfaces (i.e. virtual interfaces used within the protocol), and
- external DCF interfaces (i.e. physical interfaces that will appear in interface lists in the UI).

By default, all DCF interfaces are considered external. Interfaces that should be considered internal, have to be explicitly marked as internal. See the following example.

```xml
<Protocol xmlns="http://www.skyline.be/protocol">
  ...
  <ParameterGroups>
    <Group id="1" name="500_in" type="in" dynamicId="500" dynamicIndex="*" isInternal="true"/>
    <Group id="2" name="1000_out" type="out" dynamicId="1000" dynamicIndex="*"/>
    <Group id="3" name="1500_inout" type="inout" dynamicId="1500" dynamicIndex="*"/>
    <Group id="4" name="2000_inout" type="inout" dynamicId="2000" dynamicIndex="*"/>
    <Group id="5" name="fixed" type="inout" isInternal="true"/>
  </ParameterGroups>
  ...
```

#### SNMP polling: Retrieving polling delta time per row \[ID 29445\]

The notify protocol command NT_GET_BITRATE_DELTA, which can be launched from within a QAction, has been expanded to be able to retrieve the delta times per row when polling an SNMP table. However, this will only work for the multipleGetNext and multipleGetBulk polling schemes since only these polling schemes retrieve entire rows per request.

It is advised to enable this feature at startup using the notify protocol command NT_SET_BITRATE_DELTA_INDEX_TRACKING with either a single parameter ID or multiple parameter IDs. This information will not be saved and will only be kept as long as the element is running. See the following examples. The first call will enable the tracking for parameters 100 and 200. The second call will disable the tracking for parameter 100.

- `protocol.NotifyProtocol(/*NT_SET_BITRATE_DELTA_INDEX_TRACKING*/ 448, new int[] {100, 200}, true);`
- `protocol.NotifyProtocol(/*NT_SET_BITRATE_DELTA_INDEX_TRACKING*/ 448, 100, false);`

Once tracking has been enabled, the information can be retrieved by using the notify protocol command NT_GET_BITRATE_DELTA with a string as second argument. In the following example, the command will return the delta value for the specified key (“1”) of the specified parameter (100). If you set the second argument to an empty string (“”), then the command will return all currently tracked keys for the parameter in question.

`object delta = protocol.NotifyProtocol(269 /*NT_GET_BITRATE_DELTA*/, 100, "1");`

The information will be returned in the following format. If only a single key is requested, the initial array will have a length of 1:

`object[] { object[] {string key1, int delta1}, object[] {string key2, int delta2} }`

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If the requested key could not be found, or if no polling happened since the tracking was enabled, an empty array will be returned.
> - If there were no 2 poll cycles, or if the requested key was only present in 1 poll cycle, then the delta value will be returned as -1.

#### Protocols - QActions: #define ALARM_SQUASHING \[ID 29549\]

The preprocessor directive “#define ALARM_SQUASHING” will now automatically be added to each QAction when compiling a protocol.

In QActions, all code related to alarm squashing should be enclosed as follows:

```csharp
#if ALARM_SQUASHING
    // Code specific for alarm squashing (DataMiner 10.1.0 and later)
#else
    // Code for DataMiner 10.0.0 and earlier
#endif
```

This allows protocols that contain alarm squashing functionality to also be compiled on DataMiner versions that do not support alarm squashing.

### DMS Cube

#### Visual Overview: AlarmSettings tag of MaintenanceSettings.xml has new elementTimeoutMode attribute \[ID 29498\]

Next to the serviceTimeoutMode and viewTimeoutMode attributes, the AlarmSettings tag of the MaintenanceSettings.xml file now also has an elementTimeoutMode attribute.

Similar to the other two attributes, it can be set to one of the following values.

| Value | Description |
|--|--|
| displayTimeout | Shapes linked to elements will only show the timeout color. The current alarm color will not be shown. (Default setting.) |
| displayBoth | Shapes linked to elements will show both the current alarm color and the timeout color. The timeout color will be shown as a hatch pattern. |

#### Visual Overview: Prevent a child shape from inheriting the service context of its parent shape \[ID 29503\]

By default, an element shape that is a child of another element shape will inherit the service context of its parent when it does not have a service context of its own.

If you want to prevent this from happening, from now on, you can add the AllowInheritance option to the child shape and set its value to false.

#### Visual Overview: New option to keep real-time charts from showing exception values in labels \[ID 29504\]

In the *ParametersOptions* shape data field for a parameter chart showing real-time values, you can now use the *VisualizeExceptions=false* option to keep the display value for exception values from being shown in a label.

| Shape data field  | Value                                                                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ParametersOptions | VisualizeExceptions=true (default behavior)<br> VisualizeExceptions=false |

#### Profiles app: New profile instance update errors \[ID 29546\]

When a ProfileInstance is updated while it is being used by one or more bookings, the following additional errors can now be returned.

When a ProfileInstance is updated without quarantine being forced (i.e. with forceQuarantine set to false):

- If no instances need to be quarantined, the update will be applied and the following warning will be returned:

  - A warning of type ProfileInstanceChangeCausedBookingReconfiguration, listing the running reservations that were reconfigured because of the update.

- If instances need to be quarantined, the update will not proceed and the following errors will be returned:

  - An error with reason ReservationsMustMovedToQuarantine, listing the reservations that need to be quarantined as well as the usages.
  - An error with reason ReservationsMustBeReconfigured, listing the bookings that will be affected by the ProfileInstance update.

When a ProfileInstance is updated with quarantine being forced (i.e. with forceQuarantine set to true), the update will proceed and the following TraceData will be returned:

- A warning of type ReservationInstancesMovedToQuarantine, listing the reservations and the usages that were quarantined.
- A warning of type ProfileInstanceChangeCausedBookingReconfiguration, listing the reservations that were reconfigured because of the update.

#### Profiles app: Profile parameters can now have settings configured \[ID 29580\]

It is now possible to configure a profile parameter to be hidden in scripts using the profile, with a new *Hide from scripts* checkbox for profile definitions and profile instances in the Profiles app.

#### EPM: Hiding chains and chain fields based on parameter values \[ID 29640\]\[ID 29656\]

DataMiner Cube now supports hiding specific chains (normal chains and search chains) and chain fields in an EPM topology based on parameter values, in the sidebar as well as in EPM Manager cards.

Below, you can find examples of how to configure conditional visibility in an element protocol.

##### Chain visibility

Example:

```xml
<Chain>
  <Display>
    <Visibility default="false">
      <Standalone pid="8">
        <Value>1</Value>
        <Value>2</Value>
      </Standalone>
    </Visibility>
  </Display>
</Chain>
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The default visibility defines the visibility when none of the conditions are met. Default: true
> - Multiple \<Standalone> elements are possible. Each one has to contain a parameter ID that refers to the trigger parameter and a set of values that toggle the visibility to the opposite setting of the one defined in the default attribute.

##### Chain field visibility

Example:

```xml
<Chain>
  <Field>
    <Display>
      <Selection>
        <Visibility default="false">
          <Standalone pid="18">
            <Value>1</Value>
            <Value>2</Value>
          </Standalone>
        </Visibility>
      </Selection>
    </Display>
  </Field>
</Chain>
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The default visibility defines the visibility when none of the conditions are met. Default: true
> - Multiple \<Standalone> elements are possible. Each one has to contain a parameter ID that refers to the trigger parameter and a set of values that toggle the visibility to the opposite setting of the one defined in the default attribute.

##### Search chain visibility

Example:

```xml
<SearchChain>
  <Display>
    <Visibility default="false">
      <Standalone pid="8">
        <Value>1</Value>
        <Value>2</Value>
      </Standalone>
    </Visibility>
  </Display>
</SearchChain>
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The default visibility defines the visibility when none of the conditions are met. Default: true
> - Multiple \<Standalone> elements are possible. Each one has to contain a parameter ID that refers to the trigger parameter and a set of values that toggle the visibility to the opposite setting of the one defined in the default attribute.

### DMS Reports & Dashboards

#### Dashboards app - GQI: New 'DCF connections' data source \[ID 25827\]\[ID 26491\]\[ID 26744\] \[ID 29505\]\[ID 29703\]

In the Generic Query Interface, a new “DCF connections” data source is now available. It will return all DCF connections in the DMS.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The “Is Internal” column indicates whether a connection has been marked internal (i.e. virtual) or external (i.e. physical).
> - External connections are configured both on the source element and the destination element. Hence, each external connection will be listed twice.
> - Connections of which both the source element and the destination element are stopped will not be listed.
> - Connections of which only the destination element is stopped will be listed once.

#### Dashboards app - State, Gauge and Ring components: Enhancements \[ID 28984\]

A number of enhancements have been made to the Gauge and Ring components:

- As to the Ring component, labels are now displayed underneath the ring.
- The Gauge and Ring components can now display the configured range (minimum and maximum value). Also, it is now possible to configure a custom range in each of those components.
- The Gauge and Ring components are now more in line with the State component. When configuring these components, it is now possible to select one of three designs (small, large and autosize) and to specify the alignment (left, center and right).

#### Dashboards app - GQI: Regular expressions in column filters will now be converted to standard table filters \[ID 29458\]

From now on, when regular expressions with the following structure are found in column filters, they will be converted to standard table filters.

| Regular expressions with the following structure ... | will be converted to ...                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| ^(Value01\|Value02\|Value03)$                        | (XXX == Value01) OR (XXX == Value02) OR (XXX == Value03) |

#### Dashboards app: Enhanced data source counters in edit panel \[ID 29495\]

In the edit panel, up to now, the counter next to each data source would indicate the total number of draggable items in that data source that matched the applied filters. From now on, each data source counter will instead indicate the amount of items in the next level only.

Imagine a DataMiner Agent with the following view tree:

Root

- child 1

  - child 3
  - child 4

- child 2

  - child 5

From now on...

- the counter of the views data source will show “(1)”, i.e. the root, and
- the counter of the root view data source will show “(2)”, i.e. child view 1 and 2.

> [!NOTE]
> The counter of the parameters data source will show the total amount of parameters.

#### Dashboards app - GQI: Aggregated and manipulated columns now have metadata \[ID 29494\] \[ID 29514\]

Metadata will now be added to columns created by an aggregation or manipulation operation within the GQI environment. This metadata will provide information regarding the operation (aggregation or manipulation) and the columns involved.

#### Dashboards app - Line chart component: New 'Fill graph' and 'Stack trend lines' options \[ID 29527\]

When configuring a line chart component, you will now find two new options in the *Styling and Information* section of the *Layout* tab.

- **Fill graph**: When you select this option, the space underneath the line will be filled with the line color.
- **Stack trend lines**: When you select this option, all lines in a graph will be stacked on top of each other.

  > [!NOTE]
  > This option is not compatible with the *Show min/max shading*, *Show minimum*, and *Show maximum* options. When you select the *Stack trend lines* option, those options will be disabled and hidden.

Also, the following chart components have been renamed:

| Old name   | New name           |
|------------|--------------------|
| Bar chart  | Column & bar chart |
| Line chart | Line & area chart  |
| Pie        | Pie & donut chart  |

#### Dashboards app: State, Gauge and Ring components can now be used as feeds by other components \[ID 29570\]\[ID 29650\]

The State, Gauge and Ring components can now be used as feeds by other components.

In other words, components using a State, Gauge and Ring component as a feed will now be able to ingest the item (element, redundancy group, service, view, protocol or index) selected in that State, Gauge or Ring component.

### DMS Automation

#### Automation scripts: #define ALARM_SQUASHING \[ID 29613\]

The preprocessor directive “#define ALARM_SQUASHING” will now automatically be added to each C# block of an Automation script.

In C# blocks, all code related to alarm squashing should be enclosed as follows:

```csharp
#if ALARM_SQUASHING
    // Code specific for alarm squashing (DataMiner 10.1.0 and later)
#else
    // Code for DataMiner 10.0.0 and earlier
#endif
```

This allows C# blocks that contain alarm squashing functionality to also be compiled on DataMiner versions that do not support alarm squashing.

> [!NOTE]
> Up to now, the following directives would only be added to QActions. These will now also be added to C# blocks of Automation scripts.
>
> - #define DBInfo
> - #define DCFv1

### DMS Web Services

#### BREAKING CHANGE: Web Services API v0 is now disabled by default \[ID 29453\]

The Web Services API v0 is now disabled by default. It is recommended to use the Web Services API v1 instead (SOAP or JSON).

> [!NOTE]
> If necessary, the Web Services API v0 can be enabled by adding the following key inside the \<appSettings> element of the C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Webpages\\API\\Web.config file:
>
> *\<add key="enableLegacyV0Interface" value="true"/>*

### DMS Mobile apps

#### Ticketing app: Executing scripts when a ticket is created, updated or deleted \[ID 29191\]

The TicketFieldResolver now includes a TicketFieldResolverSettings object, which can contain a ExecuteScriptOnTicketActionSettings object.

In an ExecuteScriptOnTicketActionSettings object, you can specify the names of the scripts that should be executed each time a ticket is created, updated or deleted. See the following example.

```csharp
var settings = new TicketFieldResolverSettings()
{
    ScriptSettings = new ExecuteScriptOnTicketActionSettings()
    {
        OnCreate = onCreateScriptName,
        OnDelete = onDeleteScriptName,
        OnUpdate = onUpdateScriptName
    }
};
var fieldResolver = new TicketFieldResolver(Guid.NewGuid())
{
    Settings = settings,
    TicketStateFieldDescriptor = { IsRequired = false }
};
```

The scripts must have an OnTicketCrud entry point defined. See the following example. This way, you can indicate the action, ticket and TicketFieldResolver for which the script was triggered.

```csharp
[AutomationEntryPoint(AutomationEntryPointType.Types.OnTicketCrud)]
public void OnTicketCrud(Engine engine, TicketID ticketId, CrudType crudType)
{
    engine.GenerateInformation($"Script triggered for {crudType} action on Ticket with ID: {ticketId.TID}")
}
```

### DMS Service & Resource Management

#### ResourceUsageDetails object now has a ConcurrencyLeft property \[ID 29592\]

The ResourceUsageDetails object now has a ConcurrencyLeft property.

When, in the ResourceManagerHelper class, you use the GetEligibleResources method, the returned ResourceUsageDetails object will now include a ConcurrencyLeft property, which will indicate the amount of concurrency left for the resource in question.

When ResourceUsageDetails is equal to null, ConcurrencyLeft will be equal to 0.

#### Export and importing ServiceProfileDefinitions and ServiceProfileInstances \[ID 29673\]

Using the ProfileHelper, it is now possible to export and import ServiceProfileInstances and ServiceProfileDefinitions.

##### Exporting ServiceProfileDefinitions and ServiceProfileInstances

The ExportServiceProfiles method allows you to export ServiceProfileDefinitions and ServiceProfileInstances. See the following example.

```csharp
var profileHelper = new ProfileHelper(engine.SendSLNetMessages);
var definitionsToExport = new List<Guid>(){ ... };
var instancesToExport = new List<Guid>(){ ... };
var exportResult = profileHelper.ImportExport.ExportServiceProfiles(definitionsToExport, instancesToExport);
```

As shown in the example above, two lists have to be provided:

- A list containing the IDs of the ServiceProfileDefinitions to be exported
- A list containing the IDs of the ServiceProfileInstances to be exported

Based on the information in those lists, the following data will be exported:

- All existing ServiceProfileDefinitions of which the ID is found in the first list.
- All existing ServiceProfileInstances of which the ID is found in the second list.
- All ServiceProfileInstances that are linked to the ServiceProfileDefinitions found in the first list.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - IDs of non-existing objects will be ignored.
> - If you only want to export the ServiceProfileInstances, you can leave the definitionsToExport list empty.

The ExportServiceProfiles method returns a ServiceProfilesExportResult object that contains the following data:

| Property                              | Type                             | Description                                                                  |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ZippedData                            | byte\[\]                         | A ZIP file containing all the exported data.                                 |
| ExportedServiceProfileDefinitions | List\<ServiceProfilesObjectInfo> | All ServiceProfileDefinitions that were successfully exported (ID and name). |
| ExportedServiceProfileInstances   | List\<ServiceProfilesObjectInfo> | All ServiceProfileInstances that were successfully exported (ID and name).   |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - When something goes wrong during an export operation, an unknown error will be added to the TraceData. which can be retrieved using profileHelper.ImportExport.GetTraceDataLastCall().
> - To pinpoint any non-existing objects, you can compare the list of IDs you provided to the list of IDs that was returned.
> - When two empty lists are passed to the export method, an ArgumentException will be thrown.

##### Importing ServiceProfileDefinitions and ServiceProfileInstances

The ImportServiceProfiles method allows you to import ServiceProfileDefinitions and ServiceProfileInstances. See the following example.

```csharp
var profileHelper = new ProfileHelper(engine.SendSLNetMessages);
byte[] zippedData = ...;
var importResult = profileHelper.ImportExport.ImportServiceProfiles(zippedData);
```

During an import operation, the objects are first unzipped from the byte array and then saved to the database after a number of compatibility checks.

Checks performed before saving a ServiceProfileDefinition:

- When a ServiceProfileDefinition already exists with the same name but a different ID, the ServiceProfileDefinition will not be imported and an error with reason ServiceProfileDefinitionNameInUse will be returned.
- When not all ProfileParameters referenced in the NodeDefinitionConfiguration exist, the ServiceProfileDefinition will not be imported and an error with reason ServiceProfileDefinitionRefersToNonExistingParameters will be returned.

Checks performed before saving a ServiceProfileInstance:

- When a ServiceProfileInstance already exist with the same name but a different ID, the ServiceProfileInstance will not be imported and an error with reason ServiceProfileInstanceNameInUse will be returned.
- When not all ParameterOverrides on the NodeInstanceConfigurations and InterfaceConfigurations refer to existing ProfileParameters, the ServiceProfileInstance will not be imported and an error with reason ServiceProfileInstanceRefersToNonExistingParameters will be returned.
- When not all NodeInstanceConfigurations and InterfaceConfigurations refer to existing ProfileInstances, the ServiceProfileInstance will not be imported and an error with reason ServiceProfileInstanceRefersToNonExistingProfileInstances will be returned.

The ImportServiceProfiles method returns a ServiceProfilesImportResult object that contains the following data:

| Property                              | Type                             | Description                                                                  |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TraceData                             | TraceData                        | All errors that occurred when importing the objects.                         |
| ImportedServiceProfileDefinitions | List\<ServiceProfilesObjectInfo> | All ServiceProfileDefinitions that were successfully imported (ID and name). |
| ImportedServiceProfileInstances   | List\<ServiceProfilesObjectInfo> | All ServiceProfileInstances that were successfully imported (ID and name).   |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The TraceData returned by profileHelper.ImportExport.GetTraceDataLastCall() will match the TraceData included in the ServiceProfilesImportResult object.
> - If you want to know why an object was not imported, you can check the TraceData.
> - When an empty byte array is passed to the import method, an ArgumentException will be thrown.

##### ServiceProfilesImportError

When an object cannot be saved to the database during an import operation, a ServiceProfilesImportError will be added to the TraceData. Below, you can find the list of all possible error reasons.

| Error reason | Description |
|--|--|
| Unknown | An unknown error occurred. |

### DMS tools

#### Standalone Elasticsearch Cluster Installer will no longer automatically configure TLS and security \[ID 29113\]

From now on, the Standalone Elasticsearch Cluster Installer tool will no longer automatically configure TLS and security.

For instructions on how to install this manually, see [Client-server TLS encryption](xref:Security_Elasticsearch#client-server-tls-encryption).

#### Standalone Elastic Backup tool will now have to be used to restore a backup of an Elasticsearch database \[ID 29677\]

When you take a backup of a DataMiner Agent, you can opt to also take a backup of its Elasticsearch database. However, as the latter will in most cases be a cluster, automatically restoring an Elasticsearch backup when restoring a DataMiner Agent is not advisable.

From now on, even when a DataMiner backup includes an Elasticsearch backup, the latter will not be automatically restored when the DataMiner backup is restored. Restoring an Elasticsearch backup will now have to be done using the Standalone Elastic Backup tool.

For more information on the Standalone Elastic Backup tool, see [Standalone Elastic Backup Tool](xref:Standalone_Elastic_Backup_Tool).

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### DMS.xml now supports using hostnames instead of IP addresses \[ID 28775\]

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Viewport and Navigate variables of a Resource Manager timeline will now be read and applied upon opening \[ID 29299\]

When, in Visual Overview, you create a shape that should display the Resource Manager timeline by adding a shape data field of type Component set to “Reservations” or “Bookings”, the Navigate and Viewport session variables allow you to control navigation and zooming within the timeline.

- The Navigate variable can be used to automatically navigate to a specified time range.
- The Viewport variable can be used to zoom to a specified time range and to visualize the time range to which you zoomed manually.

From now on, both variables can be processed immediately upon opening a visual overview with a Resource Manager timeline.

- Setting the Navigate variable using a page-level InitVar will make the timeline navigate immediately to the chosen time slot and clear the Navigate variable.
- The Viewport variable will always be read upon opening the Resource Manager timeline. In other words, if a session variable already exists in the scope in question (e.g. when the time line was opened while using the global variable scope), the timeline will automatically zoom to the last-known view port.

> [!NOTE]
> The Navigate variable will be processed after the Viewport variable.

#### DataMiner Cube - SLAnalytics: Enhanced handling of errors that occurred at startup \[ID 29311\]

- When a masked domain is opened via a URL, a warning will now be displayed, indicating that the domain is masked. Also, no edit buttons will appear.
- When you open the create ticket window or edit ticket window via a URL to create or edit a ticket from a masked domain, a warning will now be displayed, and all fields of that ticket will be disabled.

#### DataMiner Cube: Enhancements with regard to dragging, sizing and positioning of undocked windows and cards \[ID 29508\]

DataMiner Cube automatically scales each window based on the monitor it is displayed on. A number of enhancements have now been made, especially with regard to the dragging, sizing and positioning of undocked windows and cards.

Sizing:

- When a window is undocked via a drag operation, it will take the same size as the docked window.
- When a window is undocking via SHIFT-Click or via the Undock context menu action, it will take a size based on the type of window. If no specific size is provided (e.g. in case of an element card), the default size will be used (i.e. 80% of the screen size).
- Window size range: From 600x400 (minimum) to 80% of the screen (maximum)

Positioning:

- When a window is undocked, it will be centered on the Cube’s main window.
- Undocked windows will respect the screen boundaries and be confined to one screen.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Service child shapes will now be updated instead of recreated when a dynamic part changes \[ID 29568\]

When a series of service child shapes contained a dynamic part (e.g. ChildrenFilter, ChildrenSource, etc.), up to now, all those child shapes would be recreated each time one of those dynamic parts changed. From now on, when a dynamic part changes, the child shapes will be updated instead of being recreated.

#### DVE elements notifications no longer added to SLNetCOM Notification Stack \[ID 29601\]

On DataMiner startup and hourly at report generation, a batch of notifications gets forwarded between DataMiner modules, ending up on the SLNetCOM Notification Stack. Up to now, two such notifications were also forwarded for every DVE element. These will now no longer be sent.

#### SLNetCom notification thread will now only start ignoring messages after a grace period has passed \[ID 29631\]

When the SLNetCom notification thread reaches a certain threshold (defined by MaxStackSLNetCOMNotifications), the DMA assumes something is wrong and stops processing messages, requiring a restart. However, in some cases, this threshold can be reached even when nothing is wrong.

In order to prevent this, a grace period has now been introduced. When the number of SLNetCom notification messages reaches a peak, the DMA will only start ignoring messages when the number of messages on the stack is equal or greater than the threshold during the entire grace period.

Using the SLNetClientTest tool, you can specify this grace period by configuring the SLNetCOMNotificationsStackExceedsThresholdGracePeriodInMin setting (default value: 1 minute).

In the following example, a pair has three responses defined (100, 101, and 102), of which one is expected to match the received data. When the headers and trailers of responses 101 and 102 were identical to those of response 100, the data was matched as expected. However, when the header or trailer was not identical, then a match could be missed for response 101 and 102.

```xml
<Pair id="100">
  <Name>Pair 100</Name>
  <Content>
    <Command>100</Command>
    <Response>100</Response>
    <Response>101</Response>
    <Response>102</Response>
  </Content>
