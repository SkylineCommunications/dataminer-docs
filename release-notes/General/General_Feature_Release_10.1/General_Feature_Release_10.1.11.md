## New features

### DMS core functionality

#### DataMiner Object Model: DomBehaviorDefinition object & status system [ID 30443]

The DataMiner Object Model can now also contain objects of type DomBehaviorDefinition.

A DomBehaviorDefinition is a standalone object that extends a normal DomDefinition and contains configuration settings for special behavior, including the configuration of the status system. In a ModuleSettings object, the ModuleBehaviorDefinition property will contain the ID of the DomBehaviorDefinition that includes all the configuration settings that must be used in that particular module.

##### DomBehaviorDefinition properties

A DomBehaviorDefinition object has the following properties.

| Property | Type | Filterable | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| ID | DomBehaviorDefinitionId | Yes | The unique ID of the definition. |
| Name | string | Yes | The name of the definition. |
| ParentId | DomBehaviorDefinitionId | Yes | The ID of the parent DomBehavior-Definition (when using inheritance). |
| InitialStatusId | string | No | The ID of the status that should be used when new DomInstances are created. |
| Statuses | List\<DomStatus> | No | A list of all statuses. |
| StatusSectionDefinitionLinks | List\<DomStatusSectionDefinitionLink> | No | A list of links to SectionDefinitions that define which fields are required, allowed, etc. for a specific status. |
| StatusTransitions | List\<DomStatusTransition> | No | A list of all allowed status transitions. |

> [!NOTE]
> Properties of which the *Filterable* column contains “Yes” can be used for filtering using DomBehaviorDefinitionExposers.

##### DomBehaviorDefinition inheritance

One DomBehaviorDefinition can inherit from another.

Limitations:

- A DomBehaviorDefinition can only inherit from the DomBehaviorDefinition that is specified in the ModuleBehaviorDefinition property of the ModuleSettings object.
- A DomBehaviorDefinition that inherits from another DomBehaviorDefinition can only contain an ID, a parent ID and a list of additional DomStatusSectionDefinitionLinks to SectionDefinitions that are not defined in the module definition. Adding additional statuses or status transitions is not allowed.

##### Requirements

Create & update:

- The string IDs of the statuses and status transitions must not contain duplicates and should all be lowercase.
- When a ModuleDomBehaviorDefinition has been defined, the definition that is being created or updated must inherit from it. When no ModuleDomBehaviorDefinition has been defined, the ParentId property should be empty.
- The InitialStatusId property must contain the ID of an existing status.
- All status transitions must contain IDs of existing statuses.
- For each SectionDefinition/status pair, only one DomStatusSectionDefinitionLink is allowed.
- All DomStatusSectionDefinitionLinks must refer to existing status IDs.

Delete:

- A DomBehaviorDefinition can only be deleted when no DomDefinitions or other DomBehaviorDefinitions link to it.

##### Errors

The TraceData can contain one or more DomDefinitionErrors. For each error, the Id and Name properties will be filled in alongside any other property mentioned in the description. See below for a list of all possible ErrorReasons:

| Reason | Description |
|--|--|
| InvalidParentId | The DomBehaviorDefinition.ParentId property contains an unexpected ID. If a ModuleDomBehaviorDefinition is defined, it must contain the ID of that definition. If not, it should be empty. |
| InheritingDefinitionContainsInvalidData | The DomBehaviorDefinition inherits from another one, but it contains data that is not allowed. Only the DomBehaviorDefinition.StatusSectionDefinitionLinks can contain additional objects. |
| StatusTransitionsReferenceNonExistingStatuses | At least one DomStatusTransition refers to a status that does not exist. The ID(s) of the invalid transition(s) can be found in StatusTransitionsIds. |
| StatusSectionDefinitionLinksReferenceNonExistingStatuses | At least one DomStatusSectionDefinitionLink refers to a status that does not exist. The ID(s) of the invalid DomStatusSectionDefinitionLink(s) can be found in DomStatusSectionDefinitionLinkIds. |
| InvalidStatusIds | At least one status has an invalid ID (IDs should only contain lowercase characters). The ID(s) of the invalid status(es) can be found in StatusIds. |
| DuplicateStatusIds | Some statuses have duplicate status IDs. The ID(s) of the duplicate status(es) can be found in StatusIds. |
| InvalidTransitionIds | At least one transition has an invalid transition ID (IDs should only contain lowercase characters). The ID(s) of the invalid transition(s) can be found in StatusTransitionsIds. |
| DuplicateTransitionIds | Some transitions have duplicate transition IDs. The ID(s) of the duplicate transition(s) can be found in StatusTransitionsIds. |
| InUseByDomDefinitions | The DomBehaviorDefinition cannot be deleted because it is being used by at least one DomDefinition. The ID(s) of these DomDefinition(s) can be found in DomDefinitionIds. |
| InUseByDomBehaviorDefinitions | The DomBehaviorDefinition cannot be deleted because it is being used by at least one DomBehaviorDefinition. The ID(s) of these DomBehaviorDefinition(s) can be found in DomBehaviorDefinitionIds. |
| InvalidInitialStatusId | The DomBehaviorDefinition defines at least one status, but does not define a valid initial status. The ID of the invalid initial status (which can be empty) can be found in StatusIds. |
| DuplicateSectionDefinitionLinks | The DomBehaviorDefinition defines more than one DomStatusSectionDefinitionLink for the same SectionDefinition/status pair. The ID(s) of the duplicate DomStatusSectionDefinitionLinks can be found in DomStatusSectionDefinitionLinkIds. |

##### Security

Security checks are performed on CRUD actions when user permissions are configured on the DomManagerSecuritySettings (of the ModuleSettings).

- To read DomBehaviorDefinitions, users must be granted the DomManagerSecuritySettings.ViewPermission.
- To create, update or delete DomBehaviorDefinitions, users must be granted the DomManagerSecuritySettings.ConfigurePermission.

> [!NOTE]
> To create, update or delete the ModuleDomBehaviorDefinition, users must be granted the ModuleSettingsConfiguration permission.

##### Status system

In a DomManager, you can now configure a DomDefinition to use the status system.

When a DomDefinition is using the status system, each DomInstance linked to that DomDefinition has to adhere to the rules set by the status system. The status system can be configured by means of a DomBehaviorDefinition object linked to the DomDefinition. A DomBehaviorDefinition object contains properties in which you can store the statuses, the initial status, the status transitions and links to the SectionDefinitions.

Using the status system is an alternate way of defining which data should be present in a DomInstance. This means that, when a status system is used, the SectionDefinitionLinks on the DomDefinition will not be used.

> [!NOTE]
> A DomManager will detect that the status system is being used from the moment (a) a DomDefinition is linked to a DomBehaviorDefinition and (b) that DomBehaviorDefinition contains at least one status.

To set up a status system, do the following:

1. Create a new DomBehaviorDefinition.

   - Add all statuses.
   - Define the initial status.
   - Add all status transitions.
   - Configure all fields.

1. Link a DomDefinition to the DomBehaviorDefinition.

1. Create DomInstances using the appropriate statuses and fields.

Configuration:

- To configure the statuses, for each status add a DomStatus object to the Statuses list property of the DomBehaviorDefinition. A DomStatus has the following properties:

  | Property | Type   | Explanation |
  |--|--|--|
  | Id | string | The ID of the status, consisting of lowercase characters only. Example: “initial_status” |
  | DisplayName | string | The display name of the status. Example: “Initial” |

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > - The Statuses collection should not contain any DomStatus objects with identical IDs.
  > - InitialStatusId must contain the ID of an existing status. When a DomInstance is created and no status is assigned to it, it will automatically be assigned the status specified in InitialStatusId.

- To configure the allowed status transitions, for each transition add a DomStatusTransition object to the Transitions list property of the DomBehaviorDefinition. A DomStatusTransition has the following properties:

  | Property | Type | Explanation |
  |--|--|--|
  | Id | string | The ID of the transition, consisting of lowercase characters only. Example: “initial_to_accepted_status” |
  | FromStatusId | string | The ID of the status from which the DomInstance will transition. |
  | ToStatusId | string | The ID of the status to which the DomInstance will transition. |
  | FlowLevel | int | The flow level of the transition compared to other transitions. The main transition will have FlowLevel 0 (the highest priority), while alternate transitions from the same status will have FlowLevel 1 or more. |

  > [!NOTE]
  > The Transitions collection should not contain any DomStatusTransition objects with identical IDs.

- For each status, you can configure the requirements of a specific field. To do so, create DomStatusSectionDefinitionLinks that each include DomStatusFieldDescriptorLinks. A DomStatusSectionDefinitionLink has the following properties:

  | Property | Type | Explanation |
  |--|--|--|
  | Id | DomStatusSectionDefinitionLinkId | The SectionDefinitionID and the status ID. |
  | FieldDescriptorLinks | List\<DomStatusFieldDescriptorLink> | The links to FieldDescriptors that are part of the SectionDefinition. |

  A DomStatusFieldDescriptorLink contains the following properties:

  | Property | Type | Explanation |
  |--|--|--|
  | FieldDescriptorId | FieldDescriptorID | The ID of the linked FieldDescriptor. |
  | Visible | bool | Whether this field should be visible in the UI for this status. |
  | RequiredForStatus | bool | Whether a value for this field must be present and valid in this status. |
  | ReadOnly | bool | Whether values of this field are read-only in this status. |

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > - When there is no FieldDescriptorLink for an existing FieldDescriptor, then no values will be allowed for this FieldDescriptor in that specific status.
  > - The Visible property is only used to tell the UI whether the field should be visible or not.
  > - When a field is marked as required, then at least one value for this FieldDescriptor should be present in a DomInstance and all values for this FieldDescriptor should be valid according to the validators of that descriptor (if any were defined).
  > - When a field is marked as read-only for a specified status, the values cannot be changed. If none were present before transitioning to that status, none can be added anymore once the DomInstance is in that status.
  > - The existence of the SectionDefinitions and FieldDescriptors are not checked when a DomBehaviorDefinition is saved.

  Some examples of fields you can define:

  | Case | RequiredForStatus | ReadOnly | Note |
  |--|--|--|--|
  | Not allowed | N/A | N/A | When no values are allowed to be present, no FieldDescriptorLink should be added to the list. |
  | Optional & editable | false | false | A value can optionally be added or an existing value can be updated or deleted. |
  | Optional & not editable  | false | true | A value may be present but it is not required. None can be added, edited or deleted. |
  | Required & editable | true | false | A valid value must be present when transitioning to the status in question and it can be updated as long as there is at least one value and all values are valid. |
  | Required & not editable | true | true | A valid value must be present when transitioning and it can no longer be changed in this status. |

If a DomInstance is created without a status, the DomManager will automatically assign the initial status when it detects that the instance is linked to a DomDefinition that uses the status system.

Transitioning to another status can only be done by means of a specific transition request. Changing the status by performing a status update is not allowed. A transition request requires the ID of the DomInstance and the ID of the transition. These requests can be sent using the helper.

```csharp
domHelper.DomInstances.DoStatusTransition(domInstance.ID, "initial_to_acceptance");
```

When something goes wrong while performing a status transition, a DomStatusTransitionError will be returned in the TraceData of the request. This error can contain the following reasons:

| Reason | Description |
|--|--|
| StatusTransitionNotFound | The transition ID does not match any of the IDs defined on the associated DomBehaviorDefinition. This error can also occur when no valid DomBehaviorDefinition is linked. StatusTransitionId contains the ID of the transition that could not be found. |
| StatusTransitionIncompatibleWithCurrentStatus | The current status of the DomInstance does not match the “from” status defined by the transition. StatusTransitionId contains the ID of the transition that could not be completed. |
| DomInstanceContainsUnknownFieldsForNextStatus | At least one FieldValue was defined on the DomInstance for which in the DomBehaviorDefinition no link could be found to the next status. AssociatedFields contains the SectionDefinitionID/FieldDescriptorID pairs of the unknown fields. |
| DomInstanceHasInvalidFieldsForNextStatus | The DomInstance contains fields that are required but are not valid according to at least one validator. If there are multiple values for the same SectionDefinition and FieldDescriptor, only one entry will be included. AssociatedFields contains the SectionDefinitionID/FieldDescriptorID pairs of the invalid fields. |
| DomInstanceHasMissingRequiredFieldsForNextStatus | The DomInstance does not contain all fields that are required for the next status. AssociatedFields contains the SectionDefinitionID/FieldDescriptorID pairs of the missing fields. |
| CrudFailedExceptionOccurred | When saving the DomInstance, a CrudFailedException occurred. InnerTraceData will contain the TraceData included in the exception. |

It is possible to mark one DomBehaviorDefinition as the main “Module” definition. This will force all other DomBehaviorDefinitions to inherit from it, forcing them all to use the same status system. The inheriting definitions can only add extra DomStatusSectionDefinitionLinks.

#### New DataMiner process: SLSpiHost [ID 30869]

From now on, all processing with regard to system performance indicators (SPIs) will be performed by the new SLSpiHost process instead of the SLNet process.

#### DataMiner Object Model: Actions & buttons [ID 30923]

It is now possible to define actions on a DomBehaviorDefinition, which can be triggered via the DomHelper, and buttons that will execute one or more actions when clicked.

##### Defining an action

An action can be defined by adding an IDomActionDefinition to the ActionDefinitions list of a DomBehaviorDefinition. Each action definition has an ID of type string and a condition of type IDomCondition. The ID must be unique for the DomBehaviorDefinition in question and can only contain lower-case characters.

Currently, you can only define actions of type ExecuteScriptDomActionDefinition, i.e. actions that execute a specified script. This type of action has the following properties.

| Property | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| Id | string | The ID of the action. |
| Condition | IDomCondition | The condition that should be met before the action is allowed to be executed. Note: When you do not define a condition, it will always be allowed to execute the action. |
| Script | string | The name of the script to be executed. |
| Async | bool | Whether the script will be run asynchronously (true) or synchronously (false). When true, no errors or info data from the script will be returned. |
| ScriptOptions | List\<string> | A list of options (e.g. “PARAMETER:1:MyValue”) that will be passed to the SLAutomation process during execution. Note: Do not add the “DEFER” option. This option will be added automatically depending on the value of the Async property. |

The scripts that will be executed using this action require a custom entry point of type OnDomAction. This entry point method should have two arguments: the IEngine object and an ExecuteScriptDomActionContext object. See the following example.

```csharp
using Skyline.DataMiner.Automation;
using Skyline.DataMiner.Net.Apps.DataMinerObjectModel.Actions;
namespace DOM_Action_Example
{
   public class Script
   {
      public void Run(Engine engine)
      {
         engine.ExitFail("This script should be executed using the 'OnDomAction' entry point");
      }
      [AutomationEntryPoint(AutomationEntryPointType.Types.OnDomAction)]
      public void OnDomActionMethod(IEngine engine, ExecuteScriptDomActionContext context)
      {
         engine.GenerateInformation($"The DOM action with ID '{context.ActionId}' was executed.");
      }
   }
}
```

The ExecuteScriptDomActionContext object has the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| ContextId | IDMAObjectRef | The ID of the object for which the action was executed. Note: Currently, only DomInstance IDs can be specified. |
| ActionId | string | The ID of the action that triggered the script. |

If the executed script added script output to the engine object, that output will be returned in a DomActionInfo InfoData via the TraceData. See the example below, which shows how data can be added to the script and how it can be retrieved in the other script/application.

Action script code snippet:

```csharp
[AutomationEntryPoint(AutomationEntryPointType.Types.OnDomAction)]
public void OnDomActionMethod(IEngine engine, ExecuteScriptDomActionContext context)
{
   var returnValue = DoSomething();
   // Add the return value as script output
   engine.AddScriptOutput("ReturnValue", returnValue);
}
```

Calling script code snippet:

```csharp
// Execute action
domHelper.DomInstances.ExecuteAction(domInstance.ID, "do_something_action");
// Check if the TraceData contains info
var traceData = domHelper.DomInstances.GetTraceDataLastCall();
var info = traceData.InfoData.OfType<DomActionInfo>().FirstOrDefault();
if (info != null && info.InfoType == DomActionInfo.Type.ScriptOutput)
{
   var returnValue = info.Data["ReturnValue"];
   engine.GenerateInformation($"DOM script returned '{returnValue}'.");
}
```

##### Executing an action

An action can be executed by calling the ExecuteAction method on the DomInstance CrudHelperComponent of the DomHelper. The following IDs must be passed along: the ID of the DomInstance for which the action will be executed and the ID of the action that has to be executed.

```csharp
domHelper.DomInstances.ExecuteAction(domInstance.ID, "some_action_id");
```

The execute call will return TraceData when the action failed or when the condition was not met. If a non-existing DomInstance was specified, this TraceData will contain a ManagerStoreError with reason ObjectDidNotExist. In case of another error, a DomActionError will be returned with one of the following reasons:

| Reason | Description |
|--|--|
| Unknown | An unknown error has occurred. Check the logging for more information. |
| UnexpectedExceptionOccurred | An unexpected exception has occurred when executing an action. ExceptionMessage will contain the message of the exception. |
| ScriptReturnedErrors | A script has returned errors. ErrorData will contain a list of all the errors that were returned. |
| ActionDefinitionNotFound | The action that had to be executed could not be found by means of the IDMAObjectRef context ID. |
| ConditionNotMet | The condition that was specified was not met. InnerTraceData may contain additional TraceData explaining why the condition was not met. |

##### Conditions

When you define an action, you can specify the following types of conditions:

- StatusCondition
- ValidForStatusTransitionCondition

A StatusCondition is a type of condition that is met when a DomInstance has one of the defined statuses. The list of required statuses can be specified via the constructor or by adding them to the Statuses list property. When this type of condition is not met, no extra TraceData will be returned.

```csharp
var condition = new StatusCondition(new List<string> { "first_status" });
```

A ValidForStatusTransitionCondition is a type of condition that is met when a DomInstance is valid for a given status transition. The required transition ID must be assigned to the TransitionId property. When this type of condition is not met, extra TraceData will be returned via the InnerTraceData property of the DomActionError. This TraceData should contain an error of type DomStatusTransitionError.

```csharp
var condition = new ValidForStatusTransitionCondition("first_to_second_transition");
```

##### Defining buttons

A DomBehaviorDefinition contains a list of IDomButtonDefinitions. These can be used to define buttons to be shown in the UI.

Currently, it is only possible to define buttons to be shown for a DomInstance by using a DomInstanceButtonDefinition. These buttons can be linked to one or more actions that will be executed when the buttons are clicked. A DomInstanceButtonDefinition also has a condition that determines whether a button is shown or not. When no condition is specified, a button will by default be shown. A DomInstanceButtonDefinition has the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| Id | string | The ID of the button. This ID must be unique for the DomBehaviorDefinition in question and can only contain lower-case characters. |
| Layout | DomButtonDefinitionLayout | Additional properties that define how the button will be displayed. See below. |
| VisibilityCondition | IDomInstanceCondition | The condition that defines when the button will be shown. |
| ActionDefinitionIds | List\<string> | The IDs of the actions that should be executed. |

The DomButtonDefinitionLayout class has the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| Text | string | The text that will be displayed on the button. |
| Icon | string | The (optional) icon that will be displayed on the button. |
| ToolTip | string | The (optional) tooltip with more information about the button. |
| Order | int | The number assigned to the button that determines its place within a series of buttons. |

#### Virtual functions can now be included in element connectivity chains [ID 30944]

When creating a connectivity chain between parameters in an element, it is now possible to also select virtual functions to be included in that chain.

> [!NOTE]
> Virtual function alarms reside on the main element. When multiple virtual functions are defined in different element connectivity chains, the most severe RCA will be shown in the element RCA of the alarm.

#### Video thumbnails: Support for HLS streams [ID 30953]

Video thumbnails now also support HTTP Live Streaming (HLS). No plugins need to be installed.

Syntax:

```txt
#https://dma/videothumbnails/video.htm?type=HTML5-HLS&source=https://videoserver/stream.m3u8
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - For more information on HLS, see <https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/>.
> - All HLS resources must be delivered with CORS headers that permit GET requests.
> - If you access a video thumbnail player that is using HTTPS, then the media must also be served over HTTPS.
> - When the video starts automatically, in order to comply with the browser's autoplay policy, it will be muted until the user turns on the sound.

#### Logging: SLCloudEndpointManager.txt renamed to SLUMSEndpointManager.txt [ID 30974]

The SLCloudEndpointManager.txt log file has been renamed to SLUMSEndpointManager.txt.

#### SLWatchdog will now by default send an email message when an anomaly was detected [ID 30982]

In the MaintenanceSettings.xml file of a newly installed DataMiner Agent, the Watchdog.Email@active setting will now by default be set to true. In other words, on a newly installed DataMiner Agent, the SLWatchdog process will now by default send an email to the configured destination(s) whenever it detects an anomaly.

```xml
<MaintenanceSettings>
  ...
  <WatchDog>
    <EMail active="true">
      <Destination></Destination>
      <CCDestination></CCDestination>
      <BCCDestination></BCCDestination>
    </EMail>
  </WatchDog>
  ...
</MaintenanceSettings>
```

### DMS Security

#### BREAKING CHANGE: DataMiner installer will only enable ICMP and HTTP ports 80 & 8004 [ID 30913]

From now on, the DataMiner installer will by default only enable

- ICMP (ping) and
- HTTP ports 80 and 8004.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable Telnet or the SNMP agent feature, from now on, you will have to manually create a firewall rule for the HTTP ports in question.

#### DataMiner Cube: Allow users to log in with a local user account even when external authentication via SAML is activated [ID 30981] [ID 31043]

By default, DataMiner Cube provides two methods to log in to a DataMiner Agent:

- Logging in “automatically” using your Windows domain credentials.
- Entering an explicit username/password combination.

When external authentication is activated on a DataMiner Agent, bypassing the external authentication provider by entering an explicit username/password combination is only allowed for the Administrator user. However, from now on, when using external authentication via SAML, bypassing the external authentication by entering a username/password combination will be allowed for any local DataMiner user account.

#### Azure AD application query support [ID 31059]

DataMiner now supports Azure AD application querying.

From now on, a DataMiner Agent will no longer need a user name and password to connect to Azure AD. An authentication secret will suffice.

For this feature to work, the following permissions must be set in Azure AD:

- Application permission for User.Read.All and GroupMember.Read.All
- Delegated permission for User.Read

### DMS Protocols

#### Enhanced view table filtering [ID 30809]

As from DataMiner feature release version 10.1.9, view tables containing a column with view options like "view=:x:y:z" or "view=a:b:c:z" allow that column to be filtered by means of a "VALUE=" filter (e.g. VALUE=5 == abc). From now on, these filters will also work when filtering on a column of a view table that refers to a column of another view table.

> [!NOTE]
> When a directview table links to a view table with remote columns (i.e. view=:x:y:z), it is not yet possible to filter on those columns.

### DMS Cube

#### Visual Overview: ListView component can now be used to list resources [ID 28723] [ID 30998]

The ListView component can now also be used to list resources. To do so, add a shape data field of type “Source” and set its value to “Resources”.

| Shape data field | Value |
|--|--|
| Component | ListView |
| Source | Resources |
| ComponentOptions | List of options, separated by pipe characters. For an overview of all possible component options, see [Component options](xref:Creating_a_list_view#component-options). |
| Columns | The list of columns that have to be displayed. Preferably, this should be configured by specifying the name of a saved column configuration, e.g. MyColumnConfig.<br> Saving a column configuration is possible via the right-click menu of the list header in DataMiner Cube. This right-click menu also allows you to load a column configuration.<br> If you do not specify this shape data field or leave it empty, all columns will be displayed. |
| Filter | Examples:<br> - Resource.Name\[string\]== 'Encoder'<br> - Resource.Name contains 'res'<br> - Resource.Name notContains 'res'<br> - Resource.ID\[Guid\] == fad6a6dd-ca3a-4b6f-9ca7-b68fd2071786<br> - Resource.MainDVEDmaID == 113<br> - Resource.PoolGUIDs contains<br>0fb47f51-ad81-47f2-9e69-3d9477bdc961<br> - Resource.MaxConcurrency != 1<br> - Resource.PropertiesDict.Location\[string\] == '3'<br> - Resource.Name\[string\] notContains 'RS' AND Resource.Name\[string\] notContains 'RT' AND Resource.Name\[string\] notContains 'ExposeFlow' <br>For more information on list view filters, see [List view filters](xref:Creating_a_list_view#list-view-filters). |

> [!NOTE]
> The IDOfSelection session variable contains a list of the IDs or GUIDs of the selected items, separated by pipe characters.

#### Alarm templates: Conditions based on service impact [ID 30691] [ID 30763]

When editing an alarm template, it is now possible to configure alarm template conditions based on service impact.

#### Logging now contains more information regarding system performance [ID 30769]

The Cube log files will now contain more information regarding system performance.

> [!NOTE]
> A new checkbox at the top of System Center’s Logging page will allow you to show or hide these System Performance Indicator (SPI) log entries.

#### Logging: New log file 'Sharing Manager' [ID 30826]

The Logging module now also allows you to access the Sharing Manager log file.

#### DataMiner Cube - Router Control: 'Direct take' mode [ID 30865]

When configuring a matrix in the Router Control module, you can now set it to either “preset mode” (i.e. the default mode) or “direct take mode”.

- In preset mode, you need to click the *Connect* button to create or delete a crosspoint between an input and an output.
- In direct take mode, you don’t need to click the *Connect* button to create or delete a crosspoint between an input and an output. When you select an input and an output, they will automatically be connected or disconnected.

> [!NOTE]
> When you use direct take mode in combination with the “Use output-first workflow” option
>
> - selecting an output will not cause crosspoints to be created or deleted, and
> - input selections will only be cleared when you select another output.

#### Sidebar: 'Advanced search' improvements [ID 30885]

Up to now, the advanced search pane was only added to the sidebar after you entered a search string in the search box in the middle of the Cube header bar and then clicked the “Advanced search for” option at the bottom of the suggestions list. From now on, you can directly open the advanced search pane by clicking the ellipsis button (“...”) in the sidebar and selecting the *Search* button.

In addition, there is now a search box at the top of the advanced search pane, so you can search from directly in the pane.

#### DataMiner Agent will no longer be selected by default when creating a new element on an DataMiner System with multiple agents [ID 30889]

When you created an element on a DataMiner System with multiple agents, up to now, the DMA to which you were connected would by default be selected in the DMA selection box. To prevent users from all creating new elements on the same agent, from now on, whenever there are multiple agents in the DataMiner System, no agent will be selected by default.

> [!NOTE]
> When you duplicate an element, the DMA selection box will by default be set to the same DMA as the original element.

#### Visual Overview: Edge/WebView2 browser engine [ID 30940]

In DataMiner Cube, up to now, embedded webpages could be displayed using either Chromium or Microsoft Internet Explorer. From now on, it is also possible to use Microsoft Edge (WebView2).

Using this new Edge browser engine offers a number of advantages:

- The web content is rendered directly to the graphics card.
- The browser engine automatically receives updates via Windows Update, independent of DataMiner or Cube version.
- Proprietary codecs such as H.264 and AAC are supported.

To set this browser engine as the system default for all users, go to *System Center \> System Settings \> Plugins*, and set the *Web browser Engine* option to “Edge”.

If you want a shape to display a webpage using the Edge web browser regardless of Cube’s default browser engine setting, add a shape data field of type *Options* to the shape containing the web browser control, and set its value to “UseEdge”.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Currently, the Edge web browser engine cannot be used in DataMiner web apps like Ticketing, Dashboards, etc.
> - The WebView2 Runtime will automatically be installed when using Office 365 Apps. It will also come pre-installed with Windows 11. It will not be included in DataMiner upgrade packages.

#### Sidebar: Pinning and unpinning sidebar items [ID 30963]

It is now possible to pin and unpin items in the sidebar.

- To pin an item, click the ellipsis button (“...”), and then click the item you want to pin to the sidebar.
- To unpin an item, right-click the item in the sidebar, and click *Unpin*.

> [!NOTE]

#### Visual Overview: Setting the background color of a static shape using a shape data field of type 'BackgroundColor' [ID 30964]

Using a shape data field of type *BackgroundColor* it is now possible to set the background color of a static shape, i.e. a shape that is not linked to an element, a service or a view.

| Shape data field | Value |
|--|--|
| BackgroundColor  | \<color> |

The \<color> value in the example above can be specified as follows:

- An HTML color code (e.g. #FF102030)
- An RGB color code (e.g. 40,50,60)
- A standard color name (e.g. magenta)
- A color placeholder referring to one of the configured DataMiner alarm colors (e.g. \[color:severity=minor\])
- A placeholder referring to a variable containing a color value (e.g. \[PageVar:MyColorSessionVar\])

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If you specified a valid color or if the placeholder resolves correctly, the color you specified will overrule the shape’s default background color. Note that if blinking was enabled, it will be disabled.
> - If you specify a custom BackgroundColor, shape transparency will work as before.

#### System Center - Analytics config: New setting 'Maximum group size' [ID 30993] [ID 31093]
