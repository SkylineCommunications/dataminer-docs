## New features

### DMS core functionality

#### Failover: PowerShell scripts can now be triggered when a Failover agent claims or releases a virtual IP address \[ID 28236\]

When a Failover agent claims or releases a virtual IP address, the following PowerShell scripts will now be triggered (if they exist):

- C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Tools\\VIPAcquired.ps1
- C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Tools\\VIPReleased.ps1

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The VIPAcquired script will also be triggered when the online agent starts, but the VIPReleased script will not be triggered when the offline agent starts.
> - The content of the Failover scripts can be read and modified using the FailoverScriptManagerHelper.

#### Elasticsearch: Multicluster offload \[ID 28295\]\[ID 28384\]\[ID 28473\]

It is now possible to have data offloaded to multiple Elasticsearch clusters, i.e. a main cluster and a number of replicated clusters.

Read actions are sent to the main cluster only, while write, delete and other modifying actions are sent to the main cluster as well as to all replicated clusters.

When an error occurs on one of the replicated clusters, a single alarm will be generated, indicating that there is a chance that not all data was replicated. If subsequent errors occur on the replicated clusters, no new similar alarms will be generated until after the DMA has been restarted.

##### Configuration

The configuration of the Elasticsearch clusters can be stored in a new DBConfiguration.xml file, located in the C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Database folder. This configuration file takes priority over the existing DB.xml file when it comes to Elasticsearch.

At DataMiner startup, when the DBConfiguration.xml file exists and an Elasticsearch connection is defined in the DB.xml file, the Elasticsearch connection is commented out in the DB.xml file and an additional comment is added, indicating that the Elasticsearch configuration is taken from the DBConfiguration.xml file instead.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The cluster with the lowest “priorityOrder” value is considered the main cluster. All other clusters are considered the replicated clusters.
> - The DBConfiguration.xml file is not synchronized among the DMAs in a DMS.

#### Message throttling configuration in MaintenanceSettings.xml \[ID 28335\]

It is now possible to fine-tune message throttling, i.e. a mechanism that avoids an excessive number of parameter update messages getting sent to a client at the same time, using the following settings in *MaintenanceSettings.xml*:

- *MessageThrottlingThreshold*: Time interval in ms. The default and minimum value is 250. If two updates for the same parameter are received within this interval, message throttling is activated. The first of the parameter updates is sent immediately, but messages for the same parameter that come after this are throttled until no more parameter updates have been received for this same time interval. Once the throttling has stopped, the last update is also sent after at most this time interval.

- *MessageThrottlingPeriodicUpdate*: Time interval in ms. The default value is 1000, and the value must always be at least twice the *MessageThrottlingThreshold* value. If there is a steady flow of updates for the same parameter, and message throttling is activated, a periodic update is sent after this interval.

Example:

```xml
<MaintenanceSettings>
  ...
  <SLNet>
    ...
    <MessageThrottlingThreshold>250</MessageThrottlingThreshold>
    <MessageThrottlingPeriodicUpdate>1000</MessageThrottlingPeriodicUpdate>
    ...
  </SLNet>
  ...
</MaintenanceSettings>
```

#### Failover: Connecting to the online agent using a DNS record with 2 IP addresses \[ID 28634\]

It is now possible to connect to the online agent in a Failover setup when that setup only has a single DNS record containing 2 IP addresses (i.e. one for the online agent and one for the offline agent).

#### DataMiner Object Model: Event messages \[ID 28635\]

Every DomManager can now send out the following event messages:

| Event message                            | Description                                                       |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DomSectionDefinitionsChangedEventMessage | Generated when a SectionDefinition is created, updated or deleted |
| DomDefinitionsChangedEventMessage        | Generated when a DomDefinition is created, updated or deleted     |
| DomInstancesChangedEventMessage          | Generated when a DomInstance is created, updated or deleted       |
| DomTemplatesChangedEventMessage          | Generated when a DomTemplate is created, updated or deleted       |

Since multiple DomManager instances can send out the above-mentioned event messages (each with their own unique module ID), the ModuleEventSubscriptionFilter\<T>(string moduleId) subscription filter can be used to return events of type T sent by the DomManager with ID moduleId.

#### DataMiner Object Model: EnableInformationEvents property \[ID 28703\]

If you want an information event to be generated for every create, read, update or delete action performed on a DOM object, in the DomManager settings, you can now enable the EnableInformationEvents property.

Default value: false

#### DataMiner Object Model - DomManager: DomInstance history \[ID 28709\]

A DomManager now keeps track of the DomInstance history. A DomInstance change will now be created after each successful create, read, update or delete action performed on a DOM object.

Changes to FieldValues will be stored in DomFieldValueChange objects containing the following items:

| Item              | Description                                                      |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FieldDescriptorId | The ID of the Field descriptor                                   |
| CrudType          | Whether this change is a create, update or delete                |
| ValueBefore       | The value before the change (will be null when this is a create) |
| ValueAfter        | The value after the change (will be null when this is a delete)  |

Per DomInstance section, those DomFieldValueChange objects will be bundled in a DomSectionChange object containing the following items:

| Item              | Description                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| SectionId         | The ID of the section                |
| FieldValueChanges | The list of FieldValueChange objects |

The DomSectionChange objects will be stored in a HistoryChange object, which contains the metadata of the change. That metadata can then be used for filtering purposes:

| Item         | Description                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ID           | A unique Guid (Filterable)                                       |
| SubjectId    | The ID of the DomInstance (Filterable)                           |
| Time         | The UTC time at which the change was done (Filterable)           |
| FullUsername | The name of the user who initiated the change (Filterable)       |
| DmaId        | The ID of the DMA on which the change was initiated (Filterable) |
| Changes      | The list of DomSectionChange objects                             |

The changes can be retrieved and filtered using the DomHelper. See the following examples:

```csharp
var filter = HistoryChangeExposers.SubjectID.Equal(domInstance.ID.ToFileFriendlyString());
```

```csharp
var history = domHelper.DomInstanceHistory.Read(filter);
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If the history storage were to work incorrectly, this will not affect the create, read, update or delete actions performed on the DomInstances. An error will be logged each time a history object could not be saved. A notice will only be generated once every hour.
> - It is not possible to manually create, update or delete history objects.
> - All history changes related to a DomInstance will automatically be deleted when that DomInstance is deleted.
> - History data is stored in a separate index per module (chistory_dominstance\_\*module id\*).

#### DataMiner Object Model - DomManager: Add attachments to DomInstances \[ID 28739\]

It is now possible to add attachments to DomInstance objects. See the examples below.

```csharp
var domHelper new DomHelper(engine.SendSLNetMessages, PermissionTestModuleId);
var fileBytes = File.ReadAllBytes("path");
// Adding an attachment
domHelper.DomInstances.Attachments.Add(domInstanceId, "filename", fileBytes);
// Get the names of all attachments
domHelper.DomInstances.Attachments.GetFileNames(domInstanceId);
// Get the content of an attachment
domHelper.DomInstances.Attachments.Get(domInstanceId, "filename");
// Delete an attachment
domHelper.DomInstances.Attachments.Delete(domInstanceId, "filename");
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The maximum size of the attachments is determined by the Documents.MaxSize setting, located in the MaintenanceSettings.xml file. Default: 20 Mb. Trying to upload a larger file will result in a DataMinerException.
> - If a DomInstance is deleted, all its attachments will physically be deleted from disk. They will not be recoverable.
> - Manipulating DomInstance attachments requires the same user permissions as normal DomInstance management operations: Read permission to view and download attachments and Edit permission to add and delete attachments.
> - All DomInstance attachments are synchronized throughout the DataMiner System. To include them in a backup, select the “All documents located on this DMA” backup option.

### DMS Security

#### Elasticsearch: Security now by default disabled on new installations \[ID 28598\]

From now on, when you install an Elasticsearch database, security will be disabled by default (basic authentication and TLS).

#### DataMiner Cube - System Center: Account linking user permission added \[ID 28643\]

In preparation for the cloud connected Agents feature (currently still in soft launch), the user permission *Account linking* has been added in the Users /Groups section of System Center, under *Modules* > *System configuration* > *Cloud sharing*. This user permission determines whether users can link a DataMiner account to a cloud account, which is necessary to be able to share items in the cloud or stop sharing items in the cloud.

### DMS Cube

#### Launching DataMiner Cube on a specific host using the cube:// protocol \[ID 28160\]

Using the cube:// protocol, it is now possible to launch a DataMiner Cube on a specific host. All existing URL arguments are supported.

Examples:

- cube://mydma?element=MyElement
- cube://10.11.12.13?view=12

#### DataMiner Cube start window: Grouping, rearranging and filtering tiles \[ID 28346\]

In the DataMiner Cube start window, tiles representing DataMiner Systems or DataMiner Agents can now be grouped, rearranged and filtered.

- To create a new group, drag a tile out of its current group.
- To name or rename a group, click above the group and enter the (new) name.
- To move a tile to another position (or another group), drag it to its new position.
- To filter the tiles, hover over the looking glass and enter a search string in the search box. Alternatively, you can also start typing a search string without going to the search box.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When a search does not yield any results, you can click the plus icon or press ENTER to add the host name or IP address you were looking for.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The start window now has keyboard support. Use the arrow keys to move from one tile to the next, and press ENTER to launch.
> - The start window can now be resized. When you resize and/or reposition the window, its new size and position will be saved.

#### Visual Overview: TableRowFilter option of ParameterControlOptions data item now supports FullFilter syntax \[ID 28531\]

When defining a table control in Visual Overview, it is now possible to use FullFilter syntax when configuring the *TableRowFilter* option in the *ParameterControlOptions* data item.

Example:

| Shape data field        | Value                                            |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Element                 | MyTableElement                                   |
| ParameterControl        | 1000                                             |
| ParameterControlOptions | TableRowFilter:FULLFILTER=(PK == 0) OR (DK == 1) |

#### Service & Resource Management - Services app: Existing connections between node interfaces can now be edited on the service diagram using drag and drop \[ID 28597\]

In the service diagram, it is now possible to change the end points of connections between service definition node interfaces using drag and drop.

1. Select an existing connection. Its “from” and “to” interfaces will be highlighted.
2. Click the endpoint you want to change and drag it onto another endpoint while keeping the mouse button pressed.
3. Release the mouse button. The connection will now have changed. Its source point will be the same as before, but its endpoint will have changed.

#### DataMiner Cube start window: Opening a Cube instance without closing the start window \[ID 28608\]

It is now possible to connect to a DMA without closing the start window. To do so, in the start window, click a tile while holding the Ctrl key.

This will allow you to open multiple instances of DataMiner Cube, each connected to a different DMA.

> [!NOTE]
> If you press Enter while holding the Ctrl key, a Cube instance will open and connect to the DMA specified in the currently selected tile.

#### DataMiner Cube: Option to return to the start window after logging out \[ID 28648\]

When you log out of DataMiner Cube, the login window appears. In that window, you can now click the *Back to start window* button to return to the DataMiner Cube start window.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Translations added for two new reasons mentioned in Value column of group alarms generated by Automatic incident tracking \[ID 28676\]

When automatic incident tracking is activated, active alarms that are related to the same incident will automatically be grouped into a new alarm, and the Value column of such an alarm will show the reason why the alarms underneath it were grouped.

Translations have now been added for two new reasons:

- View group
- Custom property group (which will be formatted as “\<propertyName> group: \<value>”)

#### EPM: Chain grouping & automatic selection of single filter values \[ID 28751\]\[ID 28834\]\[ID 28846\]

In DataMiner Cube, EPM chains with the same value in the protocol’s Chain@groupingName element attribute (see example below) will now be grouped under that value in the EPM manager card (side panel and tabs) and in the chains selection box located in the topology sidebar.

Also, it is now possible to specify one filter value per chain that should be selected by default in filter boxes that contain only that specific value.

##### Example of a Protocol.Chains.Chain element with a group name and a default filter value

See the following example. The chain named “MyChain” will be part of the group named “MyChainGroup”, and if the filter named “MyField” only has one value, it will automatically be selected when you open the chain in the CPE manager or the topology tab in the sidebar.

```xml
<Protocol>
  <Chains>
    <Chain name="MyChain" defaultSelectionField="MyField" groupingName="MyChainGroup">
      ...
    </Chain>
  </Chains>
</Protocol>
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Each chain can only be part of a single chain group.
> - Chains that are not part of a group will be displayed as top-level tabs (on the same level as the group tabs).

#### Settings window: 'Surveyor' section renamed to 'Sidebar' & New 'Launch EPM card on filter selection' setting added \[ID 28788\]

In the user settings tab of the *Settings* window, the *Surveyor* section has been renamed to *Sidebar*.

Also, in that section, the existing Surveyor settings have now been grouped under the title “Surveyor”, and a new *Launch EPM card on filter selection* setting has been added under the title “Topology”. When you enable this new setting, an EPM card will automatically be launched after selecting an item in a topology tab filter.

### DMS Reports & Dashboards

#### Dashboards app: Parameter table filters \[ID 28539\]

In line chart components, it is now possible to configure a parameter table filter that will allow you to filter out specific rows.

Currently, two types of filters can be configured: VALUE and FULLFILTER. Built-in Intellisense will help you construct the filter.

Examples:

- value=PK == 1
- value=DK==Izegem
- value=518==5;value=522>=10
- fullfilter=(value=PK ==1 or value=PK ==2)
- fullfilter=((value=PK \> 36) and (value=518 in_range 1/5 )) or (VALUE=DK == Brus\*)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Currently, only line chart components support the use of parameter table filters.
> - Parameter table filters can only be configured when you have started the Dashboards app with the *showAdvancedSettings* URL parameter set to true.
> - When you update a filter, you have to re-add it to the component.

#### Dashboards app - GQI: Exception values will now be processed as discrete values \[ID 28570\]

In GQI operators, up to now, exception values were processed as regular values. From now on, they will be processed as discrete values. As a result, the TopX operator and the following aggregation methods will no longer take them into account:

- Average
- Max
- Min
- Percentile
- Standard deviation
- Sum

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The *Count* and *Distinct count* aggregation methods will take exception values into account.
> - Exception values will not be taken into account when calculating the minimum and maximum value for columns using GenIfColumnFetch-Requests.

#### Dashboards app - Bar chart component: Negative values & Dynamic axis labels \[ID 28617\]

The bar chart component now supports negative values.

Also, the number of axis labels displayed will now depend on the size of the chart. Up to now, a fixed number of axis labels would be displayed.

#### Dashboards app - State component: Alignment setting \[ID 28633\]

The layout pane of a State component now has an additional setting that allows you to align its contents (left/center/right).

Also, in the components pane on the left, the *States* section has now been renamed to *States and values*.

#### Dashboards app - Table component: GQI query result can now be exported to a CSV file \[ID 28637\]

When a table component displays the result of a GQI query, it is now possible to export that result to a CSV file.

To do so, click the ellipsis icon in the upper-right corner and select *Export to CSV*.

By default, the CSV file will be named “Query XXX” (XXX being the name of the query). If necessary, the name of the query can be changed in the *Queries* section in the table component’s data panel.

The first line of the CSV file will contain the names of the columns. The subsequent lines will contain the data, each line being a row of the query result. This data will contain the display values, not the raw values. This means that parameter values will contain units and that discrete values will be replaced by their corresponding display value.

By default, all rows of the query result will be exported. If you want to export only a subset, first select the rows to be exported and then click *Export to CSV*.

If you only want to export specific columns, you can drag those columns from the data panel onto the component before you export the data.

#### Dashboards app - Line chart component: Trend graph will now display the actual name of a profile parameter \[ID 28657\]

When, in the Dashboards app, you add a profile parameter to a line chart component, from now on, the label of its trend line will now display the actual name of the profile parameter instead of the name of the underlying parameter that is associated with it.

#### Dashboards app: State component now also supports protocol data and indices \[ID 28688\]

The state component now supports all possible data types, including protocol data and indices.

Also, the Layout pane of this component has been enhanced.

#### Dashboards app - GQI: Availability of the database will first be checked before querying an Elasticsearch database \[ID 28742\]

From now on, when GQI queries are about to fetch data from an Elasticsearch database, the availability of that database will first be checked.

#### Dashboards app: Service Definition components now accept services as data sources \[ID 28746\]

In the Dashboards app, service definition components now accept services as data sources.

When you drag a service onto a service definition component, by default, the component will display the service definition and the bookings of that service.

If necessary, you can apply a filter by specifying a time range. If you do not specify a time range, the component will display the current booking.

> [!NOTE]
> From now on, it is no longer possible to filter a service definition component when its data source is either a booking or a service definition.

#### Dashboards app - GQI: Support for dynamic units \[ID 28761\]\[ID 28831\]

A GQI query based on the *Get parameter table by ID* or *Get parameters for elements* where data sources will now, by default, inherit the dashboard’s *Use dynamic units* setting.

If necessary, you can override this automatic inheritance by selecting the component’s *Override dynamic units* setting.

> [!NOTE]
> From now on, when a GQI query does not use dynamic units, by default, parameter values will be displayed using a thin space as thousand separator.

#### Dashboards app - GQI: Using a feed as a column filter \[ID 28770\]

When building a GQI query, it is now possible to use a feed as a column filter.

Instead of providing a fixed value to filter a specific column, you can now select the *From feed* option and configure a filter by specifying the following items:

| Filter item | Description                                                                                                                |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feed        | The name of the feed that will provide the data. If only one feed is available, it will automatically be selected.         |
| Type        | The type of data that needs to be selected. If the feed only provides one type of data, it will automatically be selected. |
| Property    | The property by which the column will be filtered (depending on the type of data).                                         |

Example: If the column in question has to be filtered using the element name found in the URL of the dashboard, then you can set *Feed* to “URL”, *Type* to “Elements” and *Property* to “Name”.

### DMS Automation

#### Interactive Automation scripts: Enhanced file selector \[ID 28628\]

A number of enhancements have been made to the file selector used in interactive Automation scripts.

### DMS Service & Resource Management

#### DVE element will only be updated when certain properties of the FunctionResource are updated \[ID 28450\]

Up to now, each time you updated a FunctionResource, the DVE element would also be updated. From now on, the DVE element will only be updated when one of the following properties of the FunctionResource is updated:

- DmaID
- ElementID
- MainDVEDmaID
- MainDVEElementID
- FunctionName
- FunctionGUID
- PK
- LinkerTableEntries

#### MinReservationStart and MaxReservationCeiling checks have been removed \[ID 28575\]

The MinimumReservationStart and MaximumReservationCeiling checks have been removed.

This means that the start and stop times of ReservationInstances and ReservationDefinitions no longer need to be between the MinimumReservationStart and MaximumReservationCeiling.

Also, the following ResourceManagerErrorData reasons have now all been marked as obsolete:

- BulkAddingFirstOrLastToOLateOrTooEarly
- EndsAfterMaximumReservationCeiling
- StartsBeforeMinimumReservationStart
- ReservationDefinitionMinimumReservationStart
- ReservationDefinitionMaximumReservationCeiling

### DMS tools

#### SLNetClientTest: Viewing and editing SLNet configuration options with regard to NATS \[ID 28683\]

In the SLNetClientTest program, it is now possible to view and edit the following SLNet configuration options with regard to NATS, which are stored in the MaintenanceSettings.xml file:

- NATSDisasterCheck
- NATSResetWindow
- NATSRestartTimeout

> [!WARNING]
> The DataMiner SLNetClientTest program is an advanced system administration tool that should be used with extreme care (C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Files\\SLNetClientTest.exe).

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Correlation: Enhanced performance when clearing base alarms \[ID 28201\]

Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when simultaneously clearing a large number of correlation base alarms.

#### Dashboards app - GQI: Column selection enhancements \[ID 28202\]

When building a GQI query, it is now possible to click the up and down arrows on the right to make a column swap places with the column above or below it.

Also, by clicking the up and down arrows while holding the Ctrl key, you can make a column swap places with the nearest selected column above or below it.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Columns marked as a datasource’s default columns will be selected by default.
> - When a column selector node with values is reloaded (e.g. when an existing query is opened), the selected columns will be displayed before the unselected ones.

#### SLAnalytics will now keep track of configuration changes \[ID 28223\]

From now on, SLAnalytics will keep track of all changes made to its configuration settings.

Each DMA will keep a local configuration history, which will not be synchronized with the other DMAs in the DMS.

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance when executing the start actions of a ReservationInstance \[ID 28525\]

Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when executing the start actions of a ReservationInstance.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Enhanced performance when loading alarms into a sliding window \[ID 28537\]

Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when loading alarms into a sliding window, especially on systems with large alarm trees.

#### BPA tests can now indicate execute conditions \[ID 28576\]

The BPA interface has been extended with an ExecutionConditions property.

This way, BPA test writers can expose one or more conditions that need to be fulfilled before the BPA can be run. If the conditions are not met, the BPA will return “NoIssues” with the reason “This BPA does not apply for this DataMiner Agent”.

#### SLWatchDog will no longer try to restart NAS and NATS when they are disabled \[ID 28585\]

From now on, SLWatchDog will no longer try to restart NAS and NATS when the services are disabled. Also, when there is an active “NAS/NATS has stopped, restarting...” alarm, it will automatically be cleared after a short time.

#### DataMiner Cube - Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance when opening Cube \[ID 28603\]

Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when opening Cube, especially in SRM environments.

#### BPA tests will now be executed by helper processes \[ID 28613\]

Up to now, BPA tests were executed from within the SLNet process. They will now be executed by helper processes instead.

#### Dashboards app: Optimized rendering of GQI query results in PDF reports \[ID 28622\]

In the Automation, Correlation and Scheduler modules, you can generate a report based on a dashboard from the new Dashboards app.

Due to a number of enhancements, the way in which tables that display GQI query results are rendered in PDF reports has now been optimized. When the *Stack components* option is enabled, tables showing results from different queries will even be rendered in such a way that all result sets are displayed one after the other.

#### Failover: Heartbeat checks will now be logged in the debug logging \[ID 28627\]

In a Failover setup, heartbeat checks will now be logged in the debug logging.

#### Alarm Console: Enhanced performance when dragging the history slider \[ID 28639\]

Due to a number of enhancements made to the mechanism used to retrieve alarms from the database, overall performance has increased when dragging the history slider in the Alarm Console.

#### Cassandra: Enabling TLS on database connection \[ID 28646\]\[ID 28827\]

It is now possible to enable TLS on Cassandra database connections.

To enable TLS for a particular Cassandra database, do the following:

1. Enable TLS in the settings of the Cassandra database.
2. Enable TLS in the settings of that database in DB.xml. See the following example:

    ```xml
    <DataBase active="true" local="true" type="Cassandra">
      <DBServer>10.10.10.10</DBServer>
      <UID>myUserId</UID>
      <PWD>myPassword</PWD>
      <DB>SLDMADB</DB>
      <TLSEnabled>true</TLSEnabled>
    </DataBase>
    ```

3. Make sure DataMiner is able to use TCP port 7001.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the above-mentioned procedure only enables TLS on the database connection. It does not enable client authentication.

#### BPA tests will now also be forwarded to offline agents \[ID 28658\]

Up to now, when a BPA test could not be run on an offline agent, it would not be forwarded to that agent. Now, BPA tests will be forwarded to all agents, and clients will be notified when an offline agent is not capable of running a test.

#### When the same BPA test is uploaded again, it will be updated \[ID 28668\]

Up to now, when a BPA test was uploaded, no check would be performed to determine whether it was already present on the system.

From now on, when a BPA test is uploaded, a check will be performed:

- If a BPA test is found with the same name under the same DLL, the test will be updated, but the GUID and the schedule will be left unchanged.
- If a BPA test is found with the same name under a different DLL, an error will be thrown.
