## Changes

### Enhancements

#### SLDataGateway will now log when the TTLs of all active alarms have been refreshed [ID 44771]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU14] / 10.6.0 [CU2] - FR 10.6.5 -->

On systems where each DMA has its own Cassandra database, SLDataGateway will now log when the TTLs of all active alarms have been refreshed. This will allow you to better trace any job queue spikes caused by these refresh operations.

### Fixes

#### Business intelligence: Active alarms table would not be updated when an alarm with 0% impact was cleared [ID 44892]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU14] / 10.6.0 [CU2] - FR 10.6.5 -->

Up to now, the SLA cleaning thread would incorrectly remove history data for an active alarm that was not linked to an outage. As a result, when a replay happened, the active alarms table would no longer be updated when that alarm was cleared.
