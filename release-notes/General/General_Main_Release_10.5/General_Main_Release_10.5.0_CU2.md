### Enhancements

#### Security enhancements [ID 42307]

<!-- 42307: MR 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

### Fixes

#### Mobile Visual Overview: Problem when the same mobile visual overview was requested by multiple users of the same user group [ID 41881]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.4 -->

When multiple users of the same user group requested the same mobile visual overview, in some rare cases, a separate DataMiner Cube instance would incorrectly be created on the DataMiner Agent for each of those users, potentially causing the creation of one Cube instance to block the creation of another Cube instance.

#### Problem with aggregation alarms on Cassandra Cluster and STaaS [ID 42095]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

Up to now, aggregation alarms would not work as intended on DataMiner Systems using a Cassandra Cluster database or Storage as a Service (STaaS).

#### Mobile Visual Overview: Problem with SLHelper when removing mobile visual overview sessions [ID 42296]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

When mobile visual overview sessions were removed from a DataMiner Agent, in some cases, the SLHelper process could temporarily block other requests.

#### Element card of a DVE or Virtual Function could show incorrect alarm colors [ID 42402]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

In some cases, the `ParameterChangeEvent` or `ParameterTableUpdateEventMessage` for a primary key cell would contain an invalid `InstanceAlarmlevel` or `CellBubbleUpLevel`. As a result, when you opened an element card of a DVE or a Virtual Function, the card pages would show incorrect alarm colors.

#### STaaS: Problem with logger table queries incorrectly not yielding any results [ID 42408]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

When a logger table was queried, in some cases, the query would incorrectly not yield any results due to a filter conversion issue.

#### Problem when deleting an element or service property [ID 42434]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

When an element property or a service property was deleted, in some cases, a `KeyNotFoundException` exception could be thrown, especially when one of the elements that had a value for that property was a migrated or a swarmed element.

The property would be deleted from the *PropertyConfiguration.xml* file, but not from the elements or services that had a value for the property in question.
