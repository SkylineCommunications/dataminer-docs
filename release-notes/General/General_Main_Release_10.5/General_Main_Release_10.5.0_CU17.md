> Before you upgrade to this DataMiner version:
>
> - Make sure the Microsoft **.NET 10** hosting bundle is installed (download the latest Hosting Bundle under ASP.NET Core Runtime from [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0)). See also: [DataMiner upgrade: New prerequisite will check whether .NET 10 is installed](xref:General_Main_Release_10.5.0_CU10#dataminer-upgrade-new-prerequisite-will-check-whether-net-10-is-installed-id-44121).

### Fixes

#### History set trending would show gaps where no gaps were expected [ID 44705]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU17] / 10.6.0 [CU5] - FR 10.6.4 -->

Up to now, history set trending would show gaps where no gaps were expected.

From now on, trend records with the following *iStatus* values will no longer cause gaps in trend graphs:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| -1  | Element is starting up. |
| -2  | Element is being paused. |
| -3  | Element is being activated. |
| -4  | Element is going into a timeout state. |
| -5  | Element is coming out of a timeout state. |
| -6  | Element is being stopped. |
| -9  | Trending was started for the specified parameter. |
| -10 | Trending was stopped for the specified parameter. |

#### Cassandra Cluster / STaaS: 'Alarm events' graph on 'Reports' page of service card would incorrectly be empty [ID 45533]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU17] / 10.6.0 [CU5] - FR 10.6.8 -->

When, in a DataMiner Cube connected to a DataMiner System using Cassandra Cluster or STaaS, you opened the *Reports* page of a service card, the *Alarm events* graph would incorrectly be empty, showing "Alarm data not found in the current time range".
