### Enhancements

#### Security enhancements [ID 43789]

<!-- 43789: MR 10.5.0 [CU11] - FR 10.6.2 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### OpenSearch: Enhanced health monitoring [ID 43951]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU11] - FR 10.6.2 -->

A number of enhancements have been made with regard to health monitoring of OpenSearch databases.

Also, all logging with regard to OpenSearch health monitoring can now be found in *SLSearchHealth.txt*. Up to now, that logging was added to *SLCassandraHealth.txt*.

Note that, from now on, if not all nodes of the OpenSearch cluster are listed in the *Db.xml* file, a notice will be generated to warn operators.

### Fixes

#### Not possible to export elements with logger tables on systems with Cassandra Cluster and OpenSearch [ID 44105]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU11] - FR 10.6.2 -->

On a system with Cassandra Cluster and OpenSearch, up to now, it would incorrectly not be possible to export elements with logger tables.

A `Cassandra.InvalidQuery` exception with message "No keyspace has been specified" would be thrown and logged.

> [!NOTE]
> On a system with Cassandra Cluster and OpenSearch, it is currently not yet possible to export SLAs.
