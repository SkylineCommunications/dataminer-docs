### Enhancements

#### Logging: Setting log levels per DataMiner log file \[ID 23244\]\[ID 24771\]

In the *Logging* section of *System Center*, it is now possible to set log levels per DataMiner log file, overriding the ones specified on system level.

##### Overriding the system-wide log levels for a specific log file

1. In the tab listing the DataMiner log files (default tab name: “dataminer”), select the log file in the left-hand pane.

1. At the top of the right-hand pane, open the *Log settings* section, select the *Override log levels* option, specify a level for each of the three log levels (info, debug and error), and click *Apply levels*.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If you want to set the same non-default log levels for multiple log files, then note that you can select more than one file in step 1. To select more than one file, click one, and then click another while holding down the Ctrl key, etc. To select a list of consecutive files, click the first one in the list and then click the last one while holding down the Shift key.
> - In the left-hand pane, the current log levels for each of the DataMiner log files are displayed next to the name of the file.
>   - If a file inherits the system-wide log levels, the log levels displayed next to the file will appear in gray.
>   - If a file has specific log levels defined (i.e. if the system-wide levels are overridden), the log levels displayed next to the file will appear in black.
> - If you clear the *Override log levels* option for a particular log file, that file will again inherit the system-wide log levels.

##### Setting the system-wide log levels

1. In the tab listing the DataMiner log files (default tab name: “dataminer”), select the first entry in the left-hand pane, marked “\<Default>”.

1. At the top of the right-hand pane, open the *Log settings* section, specify a level for each of the three log levels (info, debug and error), and click *Apply levels*.

#### SLNet setting 'FlushQueuedMessagesInterval' no longer has a minimum value \[ID 24205\]

The “FlushQueuedMessagesInterval” setting controls the interval at which pending messages are flushed to clients through the callback connection. The larger this interval, the less calls will be made, but the longer the delay will be between events being generated and clients receiving them. This setting is a global setting that can be configured per DataMiner Agent, and applies to any client connecting to SLNet.

The default value is 100ms, and up to now the minimum value was 50ms. From now on, this setting no longer has a minimum value. When the interval is set to zero, there will only be a 15ms delay when an iteration did not yield any new callback launches.

#### BPA tests: Minimum version set to '0.0.0.0' by default \[ID 24634\]

When you create a BPA test, from now on, it will have its minimum version set to “0.0.0.0” by default, meaning that it will run on any DataMiner version.

#### Migrating booking data to Indexing Engine: Enhanced message in case of successful migration \[ID 24671\]\[ID 25101\]

When a booking data migration to Indexing Engine completed successfully, up to now, the following message would appear:

```txt
The migration is done with 0 failed merge(s), but without exceptions or errors.
```

From now on, the following message will appear instead:

- In case there are no failed merges:

    ```txt
    The migration has successfully been completed.
    ```

- In case there are failed merges:

    ```txt
    The migration has been completed with X failed merge(s). There were no exceptions or errors.
    ```

#### Migrating booking data to Indexing Engine: 'Show all properties' option will now by default not be selected \[ID 24717\]

When migrating booking data to Indexing Engine, up to now, the “Show all properties” option would be selected even when there were no properties to be changed. From now on, this option will by default not be selected.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum analysis: Preset will now also contain the measurement point for which the trace was measured \[ID 24729\]\[ID 24953\]\[ID 25100\]

From now on, when you save a preset, it will not only include a “measurement points" field containing all measurement points you selected, but also a “saved on measurement point” field containing the ID of the measurement point for which the trace was measured.

This will enable spectrum monitors to determine the correct set of frequencies in case the monitor runs a script that loads a preset based on a selected measurement point.

#### DataMiner Cube - Service & Resource Management: ListView enhancements \[ID 24736\]

A number of enhancements have been made to the ListView component, which is used in the Bookings and Services apps as well as in Visual Overview:

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Element state changes no longer trigger a refresh of filtered alarm tab pages \[ID 24832\]

Up to now, element state changes would trigger a refresh of filtered alarm tab pages. From now on, this will no longer happen.

#### Web Services API v1: Enhanced retrieval of trend data \[ID 24848\]

From now on, the GetTrendDataForTableParameter and GetTrendDataForTableParameterV2 methods will automatically try to retrieve real-time trend data when no average trend data is available (and vice versa).

#### DataMiner Cube will now be shipped with Segoe MDL2 Assets font \[ID 24853\]

Because client computers running a Microsoft Windows version prior to Windows 10 do not have the Segoe MDL2 Assets font installed by default, from now on, that font will be shipped with DataMiner Cube.

#### SLDMS: SLElement/SLDMS throttle removed \[ID 24862\]

Previously, the amount of simultaneous calls that native SLElement and SLDMS modules could make to the local SLNet process was limited to 1 and 5 respectively. This limit has now been removed. Both now use the same limit as other processes, i.e. 10 simultaneous calls.

If you prefer to keep the call limits as they were, you can specify the following option in the *\<appSettings>* section of the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Files\SLNetCOM.dll.config` file:

```xml
<add key="UseLegacyThrottle" value="true" />
```

When you set this *UseLegacyThrottle* option to true, the Application/DataMiner event viewer log will show entries for SLElement.exe and SLDMS.exe indicating “Applied throttle: 1” (SLElement) or “Applied throttle: 5” (SLDMS).

#### DataMiner Cube: Option to connect over Web Services will now be hidden when Web Services Enhancements is not installed on the DataMiner Agent \[ID 24918\]

When you try to connect to a DataMiner Agent that does not have Web Services Enhancements for Microsoft .NET installed, from now on, you will no longer be able to set *Connection type* to “Web services” in the logon options window of DataMiner Cube.

#### DataMiner Cube: Undocked cards now have an updated DataMiner logo in the upper-left corner \[ID 24920\]

Undocked cards now have an updated DataMiner logo in the upper-left corner.

#### Indexing Engine: A search string will only be added to the list of suggestions when the search yields results \[ID 24927\]

When, on a system with an Indexing Engine, you perform a search, from now on, the search string you entered will only be added to the list of suggestions when the search yields results.

#### SLDMS: Enhanced file locking mechanism \[ID 24954\]

A number of enhancements have been made to the file locking mechanism in SLDMS.

#### SLNet: Enhanced processing of messages sent asynchronously \[ID 24966\]

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Using subscription filters when subscribing to tree control tables \[ID 24995\]

From now on, multiple subscription filters can be configured in the *SubscriptionFilter* shape data field of a tree control. Each of the pipe-separated filters will be applied to the corresponding table specified in the *SetVar* shape data field.

In the following example, the first subscription filter (“value=101 == 1”) will be used when subscribing to the first table (with ID 100) and the second subscription filter (“value=201 == A”) will be used when subscribing to the second table (with ID 200).

| Shape data field   | Value                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| SetVar             | MyVar:\[this elementID\]:100:200 |
| SetVarOptions      | Control=TreeView                 |
| SubscriptionFilter | value=101 == 1\|value=201 == A   |

#### Automation: SetPropertyValue method will now only return after having checked that the property was set correctly \[ID 25025\]\[ID 25195\]

From now on, the *SetPropertyValue* method will only return after having checked that the property was set correctly.

Up to now, when the value of an element property was updated using the *SetPropertyValue* method on an *Element* object and immediately retrieved using the *GetPropertyValue* method, in some cases, the value returned by that last method would incorrectly be the previous value.

> [!NOTE]
> The *SetPropertyValue* method will only perform the above-mentioned check when the “check sets” option is enabled.
>
> - Before launching a script in Cube, select the “After executing a SET command, check if the read parameter or property has been set to the new value” checkbox in the script execution window.
> - When launching a script using *ExecuteScriptMessage*, make sure to activate the CHECKSETS option (“CHECKSETS:TRUE”).
>
> With this option enabled, the *SetPropertyValue* method will take slightly longer to execute. When a large number of properties need to be updated which do not need to be retrieved immediately, you can disable this option in order to increase performance.

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance when retrieving available resources \[ID 25061\]

Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when retrieving available resources (e.g. by means of the GetAvailableResource method).

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: ListView component will not show a set of default columns when no columns are configured in its shape data \[ID 25098\]

When you add a *ListView* component to a Visio page, from now on, that component will display a set of default columns when its shape data does not contain a column configuration.

#### SLTaskBarUtility: Default Agents to upgrade now set to 'cluster' \[ID 25118\]

Previously, "Agents to upgrade" was by default set to "localhost" in the SLTaskBarUtility upgrade window. In order to ensure that clusters are upgraded completely, now "cluster" is selected by default. However, not that in case the Agent is not running, localhost will still be selected.

#### Enhanced processing of large DELT export operations \[ID 25177\]

A number of enhancements have been made with respect to the DELT export process. This will prevent timeouts in the event the process gets interrupted while exporting large amounts of data.

#### Automation: UnSetFlag method now also added to IEngine interface \[ID 25188\]

Since DataMiner 10.0.0/10.0.1, you can use the engine.UnSetFlag method to clear the AllowUndef, NoInformationEvents and NoKeyCaching runtime flags in an Automation script.

This method has now also been added to the IEngine interface.

#### Additional SLPort error logging \[ID 25200\]

Additional log information is now added to the SLPort logging to make it easier to troubleshoot issues in case DataMiner cannot process an incoming read event from a device because of an issue with the socket.

However, note that this logging will only be enabled for a particular element if the IP address for this element is added in PortLog.txt. For more information on how to add this, refer to the DataMiner Help.

#### Security: LDAP queries will now time out after 5 minutes \[ID 25214\]

From now on, LDAP queries will, by default, time out after 5 minutes.

This setting can be configured in the *DataMiner.xml* file. Enter a value in seconds. If the LDAP.QueryTimeout tag is not present, a default value of 300 seconds (i.e. 5 minutes) will be taken. See the example below.

```xml
<DataMiner>
  <LDAP>
    <QueryTimeout>300</QueryTimeout>
  </LDAP>
</DataMiner>
```

> [!NOTE]
> This timeout applies to every individual LDAP query. As a result, a request to refresh all groups (which consists of multiple requests) could have a total timeout that is much larger than 5 minutes.

#### Legacy Reporter app: Alarm list component now also returns alarms of enhanced service elements \[ID 25232\]

In the legacy Reporter app, the alarm list component will now also return alarms of enhanced service elements.

#### Service & Resource Management: When checking whether a boolean ReservationInstance property is true or false, it is now also possible to specify the type as 'Bool' \[ID 25415\]

When checking whether a boolean ReservationInstance property is set to true or false, you can now specify the type as “Bool” as well as “Boolean”. See the following example:

```csharp
"ReservationInstance.Properties.\"Contributing Service\"[Bool]==false"
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Do not enclose the values true and false in single quotes. This would cause those values to be interpreted as string values instead of boolean values.
> - Do not enclose the filter in round brackets (...).

#### Service & Resource Management: Checking whether a boolean ReservationInstance property is true or false \[ID 25415\]

It is now possible to check whether a boolean ReservationInstance property is set to true or false. See the following example:

```csharp

```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Do not enclose the values true and false in single quotes. This would cause those values to be interpreted as string values instead of boolean values.
> - Do not enclose the filter in round brackets (...).
> - To indicate the type, you can use either \[Bool\] or \[Boolean\].

#### Dashboards app - Line chart component: Timestamp will now always remain visible in the legend \[ID 25421\]

When hovering over trend graph values in a line chart component, the associated timestamp will now always remain visible in the legend.

When the legend is collapsed, instead of not showing any timestamp, it will now show the timestamp above the trend values. When the legend is expanded, it will show the timestamp as it did before.

#### DataMiner Cube: User name box on login screen can now display user names with a length of up to 64 characters \[ID 25426\]

On the login screen, the user name box can now display user names with a length of up to 64 characters. Longer names will be displayed with a trailing ellipsis character (“...”).

### Fixes

#### DataMiner Cube - System Center: Agent name would not get updated after a Failover switch \[ID 24468\]

In the *Agents* section of *System Center*, after a Failover switch, in some cases, the agent name would not get updated to the name of the online agent.

#### DataMiner Cube - Automation: Problem when turning a SET action into a GET action or vice versa \[ID 24498\]

When you added a SET action to an Automation script and then changed it to a GET action (or vice versa), in some cases, it would no longer be possible to configure the action.

#### DataMiner Cube - Protocols & Templates: Problem when trying to select another protocol version in the 'List based on protocol version' box \[ID 24499\]

If an information template is based on an older protocol version that does not have the same parameters as the latest protocol version, a warning is displayed at the bottom of the information template. Above the warning, a drop-down list allows you to select a different protocol version to load those parameters instead.

In some cases, selecting a different protocol version in this drop-down list would no longer be possible.

#### DataMiner Cube - Services app: Problem when duplicating service definitions \[ID 24500\]

In some cases, when duplicating a service definition, some data would not get copied to the newly created duplicate.

When a Failover setup with the *AlwaysBruteForceOffline* option enabled had to go offline, in some cases, the agent would not be restarted when releasing the virtual IP addresses took more than 10 seconds. The agent would incorrectly remain in an undefined state. Also, when the agent eventually went online at a later stage, problems could occur. On systems with a MySQL database, for example, incorrect element alarms would start to appear.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Problem when loading a trend group in a trend component \[ID 24590\]

When you embed a trend component on a Visio page, you can have it load a trend group by setting the *Parameters* shape data field to “TrendGroup=\<username>/sharedusersettings:\<groupName>”. When this entry contained a dynamic part (e.g. \[var:xxx\]), in some cases, updates would not get processed correctly and the trend graph would be cleared.

#### Problem with file synchronization cache \[ID 24620\]

#### Problems with recursive tables \[ID 24683\]

When a recursive table was queried directly using dynamic table queries, incorrect results would be returned when a “FK=xxx” filter was used on that same recursive table.

Also, when an element with bubble-up alarms in a recursive table was restarted, some of those alarms would incorrectly be counted twice. This would produce incorrect results when alarm severities dropped.

#### Service & Resource Management: Problem when retrieving profile manager data immediately after that data had been updated \[ID 24688\]

When profile manager data (profile parameters, profile instances or profile definitions) was retrieved immediately after that data had been updated, in some cases, old data would be returned.

#### DataMiner Cube - Trending: Problem when exporting trend data to CSV while trend logging was disabled \[ID 24699\]

When you exported a trend graph to a CSV file after selecting the *Everything* option, in some cases, none or only part of the trend data would get exported when trend logging was disabled. Also, afterwards, data could be missing from the trend graph when selecting e.g. “Previous month”.

#### DataMiner Cube - Bookings app: Problem when zooming to last/next month in the bookings timeline \[ID 24704\]

#### Problem when masking an entire table \[ID 24805\]

In some cases, it would not be possible to mask an entire table.

Also, the following masking issues have been solved:

- When a row was added to a masked table or a masked column and an alarm was generated for that row, the alarm would immediately be masked. In some cases, however, the number of masked alarms (a counter found in the general parameters) would not get incremented.

- When a row was added to a masked table or a masked column and an alarm was generated for that row, the alarm would immediately be masked. In some cases, however, the comment in the alarm would incorrectly be set to “Masked by” instead of “Parameter masked by”. As a result, after the element was restarted, the number of masked alarms (a counter found in the general parameters) would incorrectly be doubled.

#### DataMiner Cube - Service & Resource Management: ListView component embedded on a Visio page would no longer get updated properly \[ID 24808\]
