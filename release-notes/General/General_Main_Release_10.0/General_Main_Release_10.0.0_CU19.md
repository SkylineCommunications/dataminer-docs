|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| -f “PATH/TO/FILE.json”<br>or<br> -file “PATH/TO/FILE.json” | Specify the file in which the test results will be stored. |

#### Security enhancements \[ID 30494\]

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### No longer possible to launch a system-wide upgrade procedure when one agent fails to upload the upgrade package \[ID 30511\]

Up to now, when an agent in a DataMiner System failed to upload a DataMiner upgrade package, it would still be possible to launch the system-wide upgrade procedure. From now on, as soon as one of the agents in a DataMiner System fails to upload an upgrade package, it will not be possible to launch a system-wide upgrade procedure.

#### SLElement: Enhanced service impact calculation \[ID 30648\]

A number of enhancements have been made to the way in which SLElement calculates the service impact of an alarm.

#### Enhanced performance when enabling virtual functions with monitored parent elements \[ID 30673\]

Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when enabling virtual functions with monitored parent elements.

#### Enhanced performance when determining the virtual impact of an alarm \[ID 30766\]

Overall performance has increased when determining the virtual function impact of an alarm.

Also, a number of issues have been fixed with regard to displaying statuses of virtual function alarms, exporting alarms to DVE child elements, masking of external alarms and updating virtual function states when alarms are cleared.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Availability of 'Count alarms' button now depends on the alarm filter that was specified \[ID 30810\]

When, in the Alarm Console, you add a new history or sliding window tab page, you can add a filter by clicking *Apply filter*. After configuring that filter, you can click *Count alarms* to see how many alarms will be retrieved when that filter is applied. However, up to now, when the filter contained one of the following items, it would not be possible to count the number of alarms that matched the filter:

- ElementType
- InterfaceImpact
- ParameterDescription
- Protocol
- ServiceImpact
- ViewID
- ViewImpact
- ViewName
- VirtualFunctionID
- VirtualFunctionImpact
- VirtualFunctionName

From now on, when the alarm filter contains one of the above-mentioned items, the *Count alarms* button will not be available.

#### Web Services API v1: SetParameter and SetParameterRow methods can now also be used to update parameters of enhanced services \[ID 30823\]

The SetParameter and SetParameterRow methods of the DataMiner Web Services API v1 can now also be used to update parameters of enhanced services.

#### DataMiner Cube - Aggregation: Enhanced performance \[ID 30917\]

Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance of the Aggregation module has increased.

#### SLDataGateway: Enhanced startup routine \[ID 30934\]

A number of enhancements will now allow the SLDataGateway process to handle Cassandra exceptions and file offload initialization errors more efficiently, which may prevent startup issues.

#### DataMiner Cube - System Center: Enhanced 'Limited administrator' tooltip \[ID 31042\]

When, in the *Users/Groups* section of *System Center*, you hover over the *Modules \> System configuration \> Security \> Specific \> Limited administrator* permission, a tooltip gives you more information about that permission. That tooltip now contains the following updated text:

```txt
* Read-only access on all groups 
* Read-only access to users in your groups 
* Create new DataMiner users 
* Editing your own user properties
```

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app - Node edge graphs: Parameter values in node tooltips would incorrectly show 'not initialized' \[ID 30694\]

When you hovered over a node, parameter values shown in the node tooltip would incorrectly be set to “not initialized”.

#### Elasticsearch installations would fail on systems on which Cassandra was installed remotely \[ID 30731\]

On systems on which Cassandra was installed remotely, in some cases, Elasticsearch installations would fail.

#### Service & Resource Management: Protocols generated for contributing services could cause errors to occur in SLScripting \[ID 30772\]

In some cases, protocols generated for contributing services could cause errors to occur in SLScripting.

#### DataMiner Cube - Settings: User group settings not taken into account when applying regional settings \[ID 30813\]

When starting up, up to now, Cube would load the regional settings before loading the user group settings. As a result, it would only take into account the user settings when applying the regional settings. From now on, Cube will also take into account the user group settings when applying the regional settings.

#### SLSNMPManager: Problem when using MultipleGetBulk to poll a table containing only a single row \[ID 30815\]

When MultipleGetBulk was used to poll a table that contained only a single row and the response from the device was cut because it exceeded the maximum package size, in some cases, the algorithm would get stuck into an infinite loop.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Child shapes representing alarms would incorrectly appear on a white background \[ID 30820\]

When generating child shapes that represent alarms, up to now, those child shapes would always appear on a white background, even when the Cube theme was set to e.g. Skyline Black.

From now on, generated child shapes that represent alarms will appear on a transparent background instead.

#### Confusing 'Already authenticated error' would be thrown when an error occurred during an authentication process \[ID 30827\]

When an error occurred during an authentication process, in some cases, a confusing “Already authenticated” exception would be thrown instead of the actual error message. From now on, the actual error message will be thrown.

#### DataMiner Cube: Alarm counter in alarm storm warning did incorrectly not decrease when alarms were cleared \[ID 30836\]

When, during an alarm storm, you hover the mouse pointer over the alarm storm warning, a tooltip appears, showing you which alarms are causing the storm and the number of alarms per parameter. Up to now, when one of those alarms got cleared, the number of alarms shown in the tooltip would incorrectly not decrease.

#### Compiled QAction DLL files would incorrectly not be deleted from the ProtocolScripts folder when a protocol was deleted \[ID 30841\]

When a protocol was deleted, up to now, the compiled QAction DLL files would incorrectly not get deleted from the C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\ProtocolScripts folder.

#### SLElement: ParameterThread error \[ID 30855\]

In some cases, a ParameterThread error could occur in SLElement.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: No longer possible to display aggregated parameter values in shapes \[ID 30864\]

In Visual Overview, it was no longer possible to display aggregated parameter values in shapes by specifying either the DMA and element ID of an aggregation element or an \[AggregationRule:...\] placeholder in a shape data field of type Aggregation.

#### Interactive Automation scripts: Value returned by the client would incorrectly be considered as an invalid file path selected in a file selector block \[ID 30879\]

When, in an interactive Automation script, a file selector block was defined after another type of input block (e.g. a checkbox), in some cases, the input block value returned by the client would incorrectly be considered as an invalid file path selected in the file selector. As a result, an “Invalid Data” error would be thrown.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Incorrect notices like '!! Unknown \<Type> R!AD for parameter xxx' \[ID 30884\]

In some rare cases, notices like “!! Unknown \<Type> RE!D for parameter 123” would incorrectly appear in the Alarm Console.

#### Protocols: QActions and their compiled versions could get linked incorrectly \[ID 30896\]

In some rare cases, errors occurring in SLScripting or SLProtocol could cause QActions and their compiled versions to be linked incorrectly.

#### Problem when disabling a virtual function and then enabling it again \[ID 30918\]

When you disabled a virtual function and then enabled it again, in some rare cases, it would incorrectly disappear from the system.

#### Problem with SLDataMiner when deleting a service or a redundancy group \[ID 30925\]

In some cases, an error could occur in SLDataMiner when a service or a redundancy group was deleted.

#### Automation: Problem with ScriptEntry.GetHashCode method \[ID 30939\]

In some cases, calling the ScriptEntry.GetHashCode method could cause a NullReference-Exception to be thrown.

#### Problem with SLAutomation when a Timespan.MaxValue timeout had been defined \[ID 30946\]

In some cases, SLAutomation would throw an ArgumentOutOfRangeException when a Timespan.MaxValue timeout had been defined.

#### Legacy Reporter: Problem with SLASPConnection when requesting trend statistics \[ID 30966\]

In some cases, an error could occur in SLASPConnection when requesting trend statistics (Minimum/Maximum/Average).

#### Alarms in tables that were part of multiple relation paths for different DVEs would not get re-evaluated when a DVE was created \[ID 30979\]

In some cases, an alarm in a table that was part of multiple relation paths would not get re-evaluated when a DVE in one of those paths exported that alarm. As a result, the alarm would not get exported to the DVE child element, causing the element state to become incorrect.

#### DVE element information would no longer be written to the database \[ID 31004\]

In some cases, DVE element information would no longer be written to the database due to a NullReferenceException in SLDBConnection.

#### DataMiner Cube: Asset Manager app failed to initialize \[ID 31072\]

In some cases, the Asset Manager app would fail to initialize.

#### Run-time errors in ParameterThread when defining a column parameter in the functions.xml \[ID 31074\]

In some cases, runtime errors could occur in the ParameterThread when defining a column parameter in the functions.xml.

#### Web Services API v1: Port details missing from result of GetElementConfiguration method \[ID 31075\]

In some cases, the result of a GetElementConfiguration method would be missing port details.

#### Table row exports for DVEs and virtual functions would trigger updates to be sent when no client applications were connected \[ID 31156\]

In some cases, table row exports for DVEs and virtual functions would trigger updates to be sent, even when no client applications were connected.
