### Enhancements

#### DataMiner Installer will now automatically select a checkbox to create an additional DataMiner user when not being executed by a user with administrative privileges \[ID 25414\]

From now on, if DataMiner Installer is not being executed by a user with administrative privileges, it will automatically select a checkbox to add the current user to the DataMiner Administrators group. This will ensure that at least one user account is available to log in to DataMiner when the installation has finished.

#### Enhanced communication between agents using HTTP and agents using HTTPS \[ID 26122\]

A number of enhancements have been made with regard to inter-agent communication within a DataMiner System, especially between agents using HTTP and agents using HTTPS.

#### BPA files will now be synchronized among all agents in a DataMiner System \[ID 26360\]

Files related to Best Practice Analysis (BPA) tests will now be synchronized among all agents in a DataMiner System.

#### Element fields now accept pipe characters and tab characters \[ID 26425\]

When adding or updating an element, it is now allowed to enter pipe characters (“\|”) and tab characters in the fields of that element.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - By default, DataMiner Cube will automatically replace tab characters by spaces.
> - Tab characters in port settings could cause problems when exporting or importing to or from a CSV file.

#### Mobile Gateway: Text messages can now contain special characters like '&' \[ID 26449\]

When DataMiner is configured to use an IP-based cell phone modem (e.g. SMSEagle), it communicates with the device via HTTP GET requests, passing values as ampersand-delimited parameters in the URL.

Up to now, when DataMiner sent a text message containing an ampersand character (“&”), the message would be cut off because the ampersand was incorrectly interpreted as a delimiter. From now on, all text messages will be URL encoded.

#### DataMiner Cube - Failover: When you chose to disable the Failover configuration, it is now also possible to select 'Cancel' \[ID 26509\]

In the Failover configuration window, up to now, when you chose to disable the Failover configuration, you were only able to select *Yes* or *No*. From now on, it is also possible to select *Cancel*.

#### DataMiner Cube - Service & Resource Management: Users will now clearly be notified when trying to configure or manage service profiles when no Indexing Engine is installed \[ID 26534\]

Since DataMiner 10.0.0, service definitions and service profiles can only be used on systems with an Indexing Engine. From now on, when no Indexing Engine is installed, DataMiner Cube will clearly indicate that it is not possible to configure service profiles in the Profiles app nor to manage them in the Services app.

#### Security checks for local connections between an SLxxx module and SLNet \[ID 26544\]

For local connections between an SLxxx module (e.g. SLDMS) and SLNet, security checks have been established. A security token will be generated and verified for each of the messages that are sent.

#### Automation: DataMiner will now check whether a parameter’s set range has not been changed dynamically \[ID 26574\]

When a parameter is set, from now on, DataMiner will check whether the set range of the parameter in question has not been changed dynamically (e.g. by an Automation script).

#### DataMiner Cube - Automation: All parameters will now be aligned vertically \[ID 26665\]

When creating or updating an Automation script in the Automation app, the parameters will now all be aligned vertically.

When, in the *Agents* section of *System Center*, you clicked *(Re)start* to restart a DataMiner Agent, up to now, it was possible to select the *Include SLNet* checkbox in the confirmation window.

This checkbox has now been removed.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: New option to show table name in parameter control shape \[ID 26694\]

Up to now, a parameter control displaying a parameter value retrieved from a table would by default also show the name of that table. From now on, this will no longer be the case.

If you want a parameter control to also show the name of the table, then specify the “ShowTableName=true” option in the *ParameterControlOptions* data field of the parameter control shape.

| Shape data field        | Value              |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
| ParameterControlOptions | ShowTableName=true |

#### DataMiner Cube: Property values in Custom tab of Properties window will now be prevented from updating automatically when a user is manually editing property values \[ID 26825\]

The values of the custom properties listed in the *Custom* tab of a *Properties* window are constantly being updated in real time. As this would sometimes cause problems when a user was manually updating one of those properties, from now on, real-time updates of custom properties listed in the *Custom* tab of the *Properties* window will be suspended as long as a user is manually editing property values in that same tab.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Enhanced performance when closing alarm tabs \[ID 26826\]

Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when closing an alarm tab, especially when all alarms in that tab are selected.

#### DataMiner Cube -Trending: Enhanced retrieval of histogram intervals \[ID 26833\]

A number of enhancements have been made to the way in which histogram intervals are retrieved.

#### DataMiner Cube - System Center: Enhanced saving of backup settings \[ID 26858\]

A number of enhancements have been made to the way in which the backup settings are saved in the *Backup* section of *System Center*.

#### Alarm template information events no longer generated upon element/DMA restart \[ID 26862\]

Previously, when an alarm template was configured to generate information events for specific values, these information events would also be generated each time the element or the DMA restarted. Now such information events will only be generated at runtime.

#### SLLogCollector now targets Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 \[ID 26888\]

SLLogCollector now targets Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2.

Also, service impact indications could in some cases be displayed incorrectly.

#### Unnecessary DataMiner restart after DataMiner startup with process in 'Suspended' state \[ID 26407\]

When DataMiner started up while a DataMiner process was still in "Suspended" state, this could cause an unnecessary DMA restart later.

#### Alarms associated with an element would be displayed incorrectly after an element restart \[ID 26410\]

When an element was restarted while alarms associated with that element were being processed, in some cases, alarms would incorrectly be duplicated or would be displayed incorrectly after the restart.

#### Problem when using SNMPv3 credentials from the credential library in conjunction with a non-primary SNMP port \[ID 26435\]

In some cases, an element startup error could be thrown when using SNMPv3 credentials from the credential library in conjunction with a non-primary SNMP port.

#### DataMiner Agent not restarting after processes were stopped \[ID 26440\]

To prevent an Agent from automatically restarting when it is stopped, up to now, DataMiner did not automatically restart when more than 2 processes stopped within a 2-minute timespan. However, this could cause problems if more than 2 processes stopped but the Agent did not stop completely. To prevent this, the Agent will now be restarted when at least one of the following processes is still running: SLDataMiner, SLElement, SLDMS and SLNet.

#### Real-time trend data requested by sending a GetTrendDataMessage would incorrectly contain additional data points beyond the specified end time \[ID 26473\]

In some cases, an agent configured to only be switched over manually would incorrectly be switched back to offline automatically in case of failing heartbeats.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Problem when a sliding window alarm tab was present when clearing alarms correlated by the alarm storm prevention mechanism \[ID 26494\]

When too many alarms are generated for the same parameter, an alarm storm prevention mechanism is triggered, which groups all those alarms into one correlated alarm. When those alarms got cleared, in some cases, an error could occur when an alarm tab of type “sliding window” was present in the Alarm Console.

#### Automation: Engine#FindElement(null) call would incorrectly return a random element \[ID 26499\]

When using an Engine#FindElement(null) call in an Automation script, in some cases, a random Element object would incorrectly be returned. From now on, NULL will be returned instead.

#### DataMiner Cube - Documents app: Problem when trying to delete a file after saving it locally \[ID 26500\]
