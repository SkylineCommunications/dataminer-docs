# General Main Release 10.0.0 - Enhancements

#### HTML5 apps: Enhanced UI component consistency \[ID 18892\]

The UI components used in all DataMiner HTML5 apps have now been made more consistent.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Enhanced service information \[ID 18310\]\[ID 19131\]

When you load a history tab page with a service filter, in some cases, not all service properties are added to the alarms. From now on, when you add a service property column to an alarm tab, a warning icon will be shown in the column header. When you hover over that icon, a tooltip will appear, indicating that some properties are not shown and that you should open the alarm card to view them all.

#### HTML5 app: Embedded spectrum components and spectrum thumbnails \[ID 18479\]\[ID 19297\]

From now on, the HTML5 app fully supports spectrum components and spectrum thumbnails embedded in Visual Overview. Up to now, those components and thumbnails would be rendered as static images.

#### DataMiner Cube: Enhanced visualization of names of table column parameters \[ID 18928\]\[ID 20175\]\[ID 20252\]\[ID 20294\]\[ID 20299\]\[ID 20309\]

From now on, in DataMiner Cube, table column parameters will be referred to by either their long display name or their short display name:

- Long display name (default name, consisting of both the table name and the column name)
- Short display name (shorthand name used e.g. inside tables and in table side panels)

The long display name of a table column parameter can be formatted in two ways:

- \[TableName\]:\[ColumnName\] (default format, e.g. “MyTable: MyTableColumn01”)
- \[ColumnName\] (\[TableName\]) (e.g. “MyTableColumn01 (MyTable)”)

#### Names of existing properties can no longer be changed \[ID 18930\]

From now on, it is no longer possible to change the name of an existing property.

#### Enhanced downgrade and upgrade actions for TTL settings \[ID 18946\]

When a DataMiner System is upgraded from a version that did not use the TTL settings in *DBMaintenance.xml* and *DBMaintenanceDMS.xml* yet to a more recent version, the deprecated settings in *MaintenanceSettings.xml* will be cleared and replaced by a note mentioning that these settings have been moved to the new DBMaintenance files. When a downgrade is executed to such an older version, the old settings will be recalculated and the values of these settings will be restored.

#### OpenSSL library version 1.1.1c now included with DataMiner \[ID 19026\]\[ID 22956\]

#### Enhanced performance due to reduction of data traffic to and from the LDAP server \[ID 19135\]

Due to a reduction of the data traffic to and from the LDAP server, overall performance has increased.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Enhanced time range options for new history tab \[ID 19285\]

In a new empty tab in the Alarm Console, the time range options to create a history tab have been rephrased and a new "More..." option is now available. Clicking the latter will open a pop-up window where you can select one of several preconfigured quick ranges or specify a custom range.

In addition, in the Settings app, these changes have also been implemented for the configuration of a default history tab for a user or group.

#### Database: Default value of HistorySlider setting set to 1 month \[ID 19299\]

The default value for the *HistorySlider* setting in the file *DB.xml* (which determines how long history alarm information is kept in the Cassandra database so that it can be visualized with the history slider in the Alarm Console) has now been set to 1 month. This change will only affect new installations or upgrades of systems where no default value had been set for this setting yet.

#### HTML5 app: Executing an Automation script by clicking a shape \[ID 19306\]

From now on, similar to DataMiner Cube, the HTML5 app also supports executing an Automation script by clicking a shape.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview / DCF: Enhanced positioning of connection property shapes in grid layout \[ID 19352\]

Up to now, when element shapes with connectivity were positioned in a grid layout, in some cases, connection property shapes would not be positioned correctly because of rescaling. From now on, those property shapes will no longer be rescaled, not even when the size of the Visio page is changed.

#### DELT import/export packages: Description.txt and Package.xml now also mention the DataMiner version that was used to create the package \[ID 19357\]

Up to now, when you created a DELT package, the *Description.txt* and *Package.xml* files mentioned the user who created the package and the time at which the package was created. From now on, those two files will also contain the DataMiner version that was used to create the package.

#### SLSNMPAgent: Service description changed \[ID 19417\]

The description of the SLSNMPAgent service has been changed from “Skyware SNMP Agent” to “SLSNMPAgent”.

#### Possibility to copy property value of alarm to other alarm field or property \[ID 19421\]

It is now possible to have the value of a property that is available for an alarm copied to a predefined field of the alarm (i.e. the *Owner*, *Comment*, *Element Name* or *Parameter Name* field) or to another property.

To do so, in the *PropertyConfiguration.xml* file, add the *copyToAlarmField* attribute to the *Property* tag of the property that needs to be copied, and set it to the correct keyword:

| Field                          | Keyword                   |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Comment                        | \[COMMENT\]               |
| Element Name                   | \[ENAME\]                 |
| Owner                          | \[OWNER\]                 |
| Parameter Name                 | \[PNAME\]                 |
| Alarm property called "name"   | \[PROPERTY:ALARM:name\]   |
| Element property called "name" | \[PROPERTY:ELEMENT:name\] |
| Service property called "name" | \[PROPERTY:SERVICE:name\] |
| View property called "name"    | \[PROPERTY:VIEW:name\]    |

For example:

```xml
<Property id="21" type="Element" name="Location" copyToAlarmField="[ENAME]" />
```

#### DataMiner Cube: New label indicating new trend group that is being added \[ID 19526\]

When a new trend group is being added in DataMiner Cube, a "\[new\]" label will be added to the trend group name in the pane that lists the existing trend groups, just as this is done for scripts in the Automation app, for example.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: ParametersSummary enhancements \[ID 19568\]

Up to now, if you specified a table parameter in a shape data item of type *ParametersSummary*, only one row was allowed to match the filter. From now on, it is possible to refer to several rows, a column, or a full table.

Examples:

- To refer to all rows that start with “SL”, you can specify “101/201:500:SL\*\|”.
- To refer to a column, specify the column parameter, e.g. “101/201:501”.
- To refer to an entire table, specify the table parameter, e.g. “101/201:500”.

#### Database: Improved handling of large batches for Cassandra database \[ID 19586\]
