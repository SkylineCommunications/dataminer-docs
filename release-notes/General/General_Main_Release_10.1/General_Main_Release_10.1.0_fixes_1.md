When SLPort receives data, it stores it in a buffer until everything has been received. If the amount of data received is larger than the size of the buffer, the buffer is automatically resized. However, in some cases, this would not happen, causing an error to occur.

#### Automation: Email sent from an Automation script had an incorrect subject \[ID 25618\]

When an email was sent from an Automation script, in some cases, the dashboard name would incorrectly be used as email subject.

#### Problem with user permissions for Automation scripts \[ID 26401\]\[ID 26957\]

Up to now the permissions to add, edit, delete and execute Automation scripts were only enforced in the client, which could make it possible for a user to modify the Automation scripts on a DMA despite not having the required permissions for this.

Now the system will enforce the permissions as follows:

- To view or retrieve an Automation script, you need the "Automation - UI available" or "Automation - Execute" permission.

#### Protocols: Hex string parameters would not contain enough leading zeros \[ID 26777\]

When a parameter value of type “double” was converted to a value of type “hex string” (e.g. a CRC parameter), in some cases, it would not contain enough leading zeros when put into a data stream.

The problem would typically occur when the parameter was configured as follows:

| Property   | Value                             |
