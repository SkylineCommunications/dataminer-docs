### Fixes

#### Problem when multiple network interfaces shared the same MAC address \[ID 27971\]

When multiple network interfaces shared the same MAC address, in some cases, DataMiner would not be able to correctly detect those interfaces.

#### Dashboards app: Trend statistics components would not show any content when part of a PDF report \[ID 28286\]

In a PDF report, in some cases, trend statistics components would not show any content.

#### Service & Resource Management: Exported protocol would show incorrect parameters after a new function file had been activated \[ID 28290\]

When a new function file was activated, which updated parameters for a particular function, in some cases, the exported protocol would incorrectly show the old parameters.

#### Dashboards app: Problem with Stack components option when generating a PDF report \[ID 28362\]

In the Automation, Correlation and Scheduler modules, you can generate a report based on a dashboard from the new Dashboards app. Up to now, in some cases, it would not be possible to generate such a report when the *Stack components* option had not been selected.

#### DataMiner Cube: Problem when navigating using breadcrumbs \[ID 28468\]

In some cases, the overall element state of a partially included element would incorrectly be visible in the breadcrumbs. Also, users would incorrectly be able to open the full element via the breadcrumbs, even when they did not have full access to that element.

And when they used the breadcrumbs to navigate to the element via the service child, the element would incorrectly be opened instead of the service.

#### Alarm templates: Problem when calculating the transition from one week to the next \[ID 28477\]

In some cases, an error could occur when, in the alarm template schedule, the transition from one week to the next was calculated.

#### Problem when updating DVE protocols \[ID 28561\]

When an existing DVE protocol was updated, in some cases, the update would fail.

#### Service & Resource Management: DecimalQuantity property of CapacityUsageParameterValue incorrectly saved without decimals \[ID 28582\]

#### Remote connections would incorrectly get removed from the local cache of a DMA when it lost its connection to another DMA \[ID 28760\]

When a DMA temporarily lost its connection to another DMA, in some cases, remote connections of other DMAs would incorrectly also get removed from its local cache.

#### Timetrace data would become incorrect when an element had been dynamically included in or excluded from a service \[ID 28777\]

When an element had dynamically been included in or excluded from a service while active alarms were present, in some cases, the alarm count for the service in timetrace would start to show an incorrect value.

Also, when an element was excluded from a service while it had active alarms, in some cases, SLDataGateway would incorrectly consider the alarm reference to have an impact on the service. When the alarm was cleared while the element was excluded, it would never be removed from the service alarm impact list. As a result, that list could keep growing, which would eventually lead to an overall decrease of the alarm handling performance.

#### DataMiner Cube: Element name and icon would be incorrectly be visible in the alarm card and the alarm details when you did not have explicit access to the element \[ID 28778\]

In some cases, alarms for an element that is partially included in a service would be visible in the Alarm Console even when you did not have explicit access to that element. Also, when you opened the alarm card or the alarm details of one of those alarms, the element icon, alarm state and name would be displayed.

From now on, this will no longer the case when you do not have access to the element itself. Also, you will no longer be able to an element card of an element to which you do not have explicit access.
