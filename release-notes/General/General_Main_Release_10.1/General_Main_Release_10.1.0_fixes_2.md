#### Dashboards app: Incorrect default indices selection in parameter feed linked to CPE feed \[ID 27116\]

If a dashboard contained a CPE feed linked to a parameter feed containing a number of indices that had to be selected by default, it could occur that changing the CPE feed selection caused this default selection to be incorrect.

#### Dashboards app: State component linked to a services feed would not immediately get updated when a service was selected \[ID 27137\]

Up to now, UIBlockDefinition.IsEnabled was not applied for blocks of type “checkbox”. From now on, a block of type “checkbox” will be disabled when the UIBlockDefinition.IsEnabled property is set to False.

Also, UIBlockDefinition.InitialValue was not applied correctly for blocks of type “calendar” when the value was not a valid ISO string. From now on, the UIBlockDefinition.InitialValue property will be ignored and the datetime picker block will be constructed based on the DMAAutomationUICalendarComponent.Timestamp property, which will contain the UTC time stamp the InitialValue represents.

Up to now, parameters of type double in generated SRM protocols would have their rawtype set to “numeric text” and their lengthtype set to 8. As a result, if a parameter of a generated SRM protocol contained a value of more than 8 characters, that value would incorrectly be replicated to 0.

From now on, parameters of type double in generated SRM protocols will have their lengthtype set to “next param” instead.

#### Dashboards app: Problem with Auto-select all indices option for Parameter feed component \[ID 27623\]

In the Dashboards app, if the *Auto-select number of indices* option was selected for a Parameter feed component, it could occur that the *Auto-select all indices* option did not work.

#### Jobs app: Problem when no domains were configured \[ID 27635\]

When no domains had been configured, in some cases, the jobs list would incorrectly keep loading. Also, when you refreshed an empty jobs list, a “page not found” error would be displayed.

> [!NOTE]

#### DataMiner Cube - Trending: Problem when exporting a trend graph to a CSV file \[ID 27708\]

When you select the *Line graph instead of block graph* option when exporting a trend graph to a CSV file, the timestamps of the average data points are put halfway between two points.

In some cases, when you exported a trend graph multiple times in a row using that line graph option, the timestamps would incorrectly keep shifting in the direction of the future.

#### DataMiner Cube - Trending: Numbers smaller than 1 could be missing their decimal separator \[ID 27717\]

In some cases, trend data numbers smaller than 1 could be missing their decimal separator.

#### Automatic incident tracking: Problem when removing the IDP location from elements with active alarms \[ID 27723\]

On a system using automatic incident tracking on which DataMiner Infrastructure Discovery Provisioning (IDP) was deployed, in some cases, when the IDP location of an element with active alarms was removed, that location would not be removed correctly. This would cause certain alarms to be grouped by an empty location.

> [!NOTE]
> From now on, IDP location grouping requires that the *Make this property available for alarm filtering* option is activated for the following element properties: IDP, Location Name, Location Building, Location Floor, Location Room, Location Aisle and Location Rack.

#### Dashboards app: Pivot table component showed an error message \[ID 27724\]

```

#### Service & Resource Management: Problem when rebinding a VirtualFunctionResource \[ID 27735\]

When a VirtualFunctionResource was unbound, in some cases, it would still be processing parameter sets from its bound element. This would cause the parameters of the unbound element to no longer be in an “uninitialized” state. Instead, they would incorrectly stay set to the last received value from the bound element.

#### Interactive Automation scripts: MinWidth, MaxWidth, MinHeight and MaxHeight properties of UIBlock components would not be parsed correctly \[ID 27736\]

Also, in some cases, the Profiles app would not load service profile objects.

#### Dashboards app - Line chart component: Trend graph incorrectly showed primary key instead of display key \[ID 27879\]

When a table parameter had a display key that was different from the primary key, up to now, the trend graph would incorrectly show the primary key. From now on, it will show the display key instead.

#### Dashboards app - Pivot table component: Problem with conditions \[ID 27897\]

When a pivot table component had conditions configured, in some cases, those conditions would incorrectly only work in conjunction with table column parameters, not with single-value parameters.

#### DataMiner Cube would constantly try to reconnect due to a problem that occurred while serializing alarm metadata in proactive suggestion events \[ID 27927\]

Due to a problem that occurred while serializing alarm metadata in proactive suggestion events, in some cases, DataMiner would constantly try to reconnect.

#### Dashboards app - Time range component: Default range would be used even after being overwritten afterwards \[ID 27941\]

In some cases, for example, rendering issues could occur when resizing table columns.

#### Dashboards: Problems with CPE feed \[ID 28157\]

When you selected a CPE filter, in some cases, the raw key would incorrectly be displayed for a short while.

Also, when you selected a chain filter (e.g. Region) and a value (e.g. California), and then selected another chain filter and value, in some cases, nothing would be displayed and an error would occur.

#### Ticketing app: Problem when creating a ticket \[ID 28167\]
