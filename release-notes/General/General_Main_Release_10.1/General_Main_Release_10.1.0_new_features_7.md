# General Main Release 10.1.0 - New features (part 7)

> [!NOTE]
> For known issues with this version, refer to [Known issues](xref:Known_issues).

> [!NOTE]
> **Internet Explorer Support**
>
> Though DataMiner Cube is available as a desktop application, many users still like to use the DataMiner browser application that requires Internet Explorer. However, Microsoft no longer recommends using Internet Explorer, and support for Internet Explorer is expected to cease in 2025, though currently the program is still maintained as part of the support policy for the versions of Windows it is included in. For more information, see <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/faq/internet-explorer-microsoft-edge>.
>
> The preferred way to use DataMiner Cube is as a desktop application, which can be downloaded from each DMA’s landing page in any other browser than Internet Explorer. From DataMiner 10.0.9 onwards, this application also comes with a new start window for increased ease of use.
>
> However, if you do wish to use DataMiner Cube in a browser, this remains possible:
>
> - Microsoft Edge can be configured to open specific URLs in IE compatibility mode. If you configure Edge to open the DataMiner Cube URLs of DMAs in this mode, you will be able to access the DMAs with DataMiner Cube in Edge. However, make sure you only do this for the exact URLs of DataMiner Cube, as other DataMiner apps will not function optimally in IE compatibility mode. For more information see, <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployEdge/edge-ie-mode-policies>.
> - You can still continue to use Internet Explorer to access DataMiner Cube as long as Microsoft support continues. However, in this case we highly recommend to use a different browser to access any other websites on the internet.

### DMS Spectrum Analysis

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum Analysis: Button to apply all settings at once \[ID 25242\]

On a spectrum analyzer element card, an "Apply all" button is now available in the settings pane, so that you can configure several settings and then apply them all at the same time.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum Analysis: Y axis of spectrum graph will no longer show values with 3 decimals if the reference level is shown in dBm and no decimal accuracy is being used \[ID 25250\]

If the reference level is shown in dBm and no decimal accuracy is being used, from now on, the Y axis of a spectrum graph will no longer show values with 3 decimals.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum Analysis: A preset will now also include the decimals to be used when displaying DBm values in spectrum graphs \[ID 25871\]

When you save a spectrum preset, from now on, that preset will also include the amount of decimals to be used when displaying DBm values on the Y axis of a spectrum graph.

### DMS tools

#### SLLogCollector: New tool to collect log files and memory dumps and send them to Skyline support \[ID 25346\]\[ID 25631\]

From now on, the SLLogCollector tool will be available on all DataMiner Agents.

In case of problems, Skyline support may ask you to use this tool to compress the necessary log files and memory dumps into a zip file, which you can then store in a folder on the DataMiner Agent or upload to Skyline.

On the DataMiner Agent, the tool itself can be found at the following location:

- C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Tools\\SLLogCollector\\SL_LogCollector.exe

When you launch the tool, the following options will be selected by default:

- Include memory dump (when runtime errors have been found on the system)

- Save to SLLogCollector folder on desktop

#### SLReset: Factory reset tool \[ID 26026\]\[ID 26408\]\[ID 27227\]

SLReset.exe is a new tool that can be used to fully reset a DataMiner Agent to its state immediately after installation. It is located in the C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Files\\ folder.

##### Optional argument

| Argument | Description                                                         |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -y       | Skip any prompts that ask you whether to run online/offline actions |

##### Online actions (i.e. actions that are only run when the DMA being reset is running)

- ResetFailoverOnline

  Deletes the Failover configuration of the DMA if one is present.

  >
  > This action uses a whitelist to determine what to keep.
  >
  > On first execution, the default whitelist is added to the C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Files\\ResetConfig.txt file. Subsequent executions will then check the whitelist found in that text file, to which you can add any file you want to keep.
  >
  > If you delete ResetConfig.txt, SLReset will again use the default whitelist.

- ResetDataMinerXml
- ResetNotifyMail
- ResetDoNotRemoveFiles

  - ElasticSearch: no security

- `-p` or `--password <password>`: The password to be used with the specified username.

- `-f` or `--forced`: Skips all prompts.

  If this argument is not used, the user will be asked for a final confirmation.

- `-d` or `--Database <keyspace>`: The database/keyspace to be cleaned. If this argument is not used, everything will be cleaned.

- `-k` or `--keepcustomcredentials`: Preserves the specified Cassandra credentials (user and password) throughout the factory reset process.
