## Prerequisites

Before you upgrade to this DataMiner version:

- Make sure **version 14.44.35211.0** or higher of the **Microsoft Visual C++ x86/x64 redistributables** is installed. Otherwise, the upgrade will trigger an **automatic reboot** of the DMA in order to complete the installation.

  The latest version of the redistributables can be downloaded from the [Microsoft website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version):

  - [vc_redist.x86.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)
  - [vc_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

- Make sure all DataMiner Agents in the cluster have been migrated to the BrokerGateway-managed NATS solution.

  For detailed information, see [Migrating to BrokerGateway](xref:BrokerGateway_Migration).

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### DataAPI: Enhanced handling of element creations failing because another element with the same name already exists [ID 45643]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU18] / 10.6.0 [CU6] - FR 10.6.9 -->

When the DataAPI fails to create an element because another element with the same name already exists, from now on, it will check whether that element has already been synchronized among the Agents in the DataMiner System. If not, the element creation will be allowed to continue.

### Fixes

#### Problem when using the 'Get parameter table by alias' data source against a STaaS database [ID 45766]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU18] / 10.6.0 [CU6] - FR 10.6.9 -->

The *Get parameter table by alias* data source retrieves a parameter table from the indexing database using the specified alias.

Up to now, this data source would only check whether the DataMiner System included an indexing database. It would not check the type of the database. As it currently only supports Elasticsearch and OpenSearch, up to now, exceptions would be thrown when it was used to retrieve data from a STaaS database.

From now on, the *Get parameter table by alias* data source will only be available when the DataMiner System includes an indexing database of type Elasticsearch or OpenSearch.
