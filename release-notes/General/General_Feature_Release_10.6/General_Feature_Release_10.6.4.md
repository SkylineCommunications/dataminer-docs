#### Problem with SLNet when receiving a subscription with a large filter that contained wildcards [ID 44512]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU13] / 10.6.0 [CU1] - FR 10.6.4 -->

When SLNet received a dynamic table subscription with a very large filter that contained wildcards, up to now, it would throw a stack overflow exception and stop working.

From now on, SLNet subscriptions will now be blocked when they contain a filter that exceeds 140,000 characters.
