### Enhancements

#### Enhanced visibility on SLNet connection issues [ID 44069]

<!-- MR 10.7.0 - FR 10.6.3 -->

Visibility on SLNet connection issues has been enhanced:

- When a dashboard cannot be loaded because a DataMiner Agent is offline, an appropriate error message will now appear in that dashboard.

- A new log file named *SLNetConnectionsMonitor.txt* will now keep a historic record of all SLNet connection states.

#### An error will now be logged if the response to an SNMP Get request cannot be mapped [ID 44329]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU12] - FR 10.6.3 -->

If the response to an *SNMP Get* request cannot be mapped, from now on, an error will be logged in the log file of the element in question and in the *SLErrorsInProtocol.txt* file.
