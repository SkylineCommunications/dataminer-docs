# General Main Release 10.1.0 CU19 – Preview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are still working on this release. Some release notes may still be modified or moved to a later release. Check back soon for updates!

### Enhancements

#### Enhanced logging of issues occurring when parsing a compliance cache file entry [ID_34212]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.0.0 [CU22]/10.1.0 [CU19]/10.2.0 [CU7] - Feature Release Version 10.2.10 -->

When an issue occurred when parsing a compliance cache file entry, up to now, a log entry of type "error" would be added to the SLDataMiner.txt log file.

From now on, when an issue occurs when parsing a compliance cache file entry, the following log entry of type "info" will be added to the SLDataMiner.txt log file instead:

```txt
Warning: <function> is unable to parse compliance cache file entry at line <line number>. <line content>
```

### Fixes

#### Service & Resource Management: Files in C:\Skyline DataMiner\ResourceManager would not be locked properly when being read or updated during a midnight synchronization [ID_34104]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU19]/10.2.0 [CU7] - Feature Release Version 10.2.10 -->

Up to now, the files stored in the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\ResourceManager` folder would not be locked properly when being read or updated during a midnight synchronization. File locking has now been improved.

#### Visual Overview: SurveyorSearchText variable continued to show cleared search input [ID_34114]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU19]/10.2.0 [CU7] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When the text in the Cube advanced search box was selected with Ctrl+A and then deleted, it could occur that the advanced search input was not cleared correctly, so that it continued to be shown by the *SurveyorSearchText* variable in Visual Overview.

#### SLNet could throw an OutOfMemoryException due to a memory leak [ID_34126]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU19]/10.2.0 [CU7] - Feature Release Version 10.2.10 -->

In some cases, SLNet could throw an OutOfMemoryException due to a memory leak.

#### Visual Overview: Connection highlight based on connection property not updated automatically [ID_34139]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU19]/10.2.0 [CU7] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When a connection in Visual Overview was highlighted based on a connection property, and the connection property changed, it could occur that the highlight style was not automatically applied to the connection line, but only after the user triggered a redraw, for example by clicking the highlight.

#### Scheduled alarm templates would incorrectly not be updated when the system time changed [ID_34154]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU19]/10.2.0 [CU7] - Feature Release Version 10.2.10 -->

When the system time changed because of e.g. a clock resynchronization or a switch to or from daylight-saving time, up to now, the start time and end time of scheduled alarm templates would incorrectly not get updated.
