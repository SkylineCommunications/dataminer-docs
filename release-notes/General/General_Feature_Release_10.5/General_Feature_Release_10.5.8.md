## Changes

### Enhancements

#### DataMiner upgrade: All TXF files will now be removed each time a DataMiner upgrade is performed [ID 43058]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU17]/10.5.0 [CU5] - FR 10.5.8 -->

From now on, each time a DataMiner upgrade is performed, all TXF files will be automatically removed from the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Scripts\` folder.

When you create an Automation script, apart from an XML file containing the actual script, a number of TXF files will be created. These will contain cached query information to speed up XML querying.

### Fixes

#### SLDataGateway could stop working because of issues caused by TPL tasks [ID 42846]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU17]/10.5.0 [CU5] - FR 10.5.8 -->

In some cases, SLDataGateway could stop working because of issues caused by TPL tasks.

The number of TPL tasks has now been reduced, especially when writing trend data to the database.

#### Error 'The object exporter specified was not found' would get logged upon DMA startup [ID 42927]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU17]/10.5.0 [CU5] - FR 10.5.8 -->

In some cases, a DataMiner Agent would not start up properly, and the following error would get logged in the *SLDataMiner.txt* log file:

`The object exporter specified was not found`

#### Redundancy groups: Alarm mentioning that all redundancy resources are in use would incorrectly not get cleared [ID 42970]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU17]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.8 -->

If a redundancy group has more primary elements than backup elements, at the moment when all backups are in use, an alarm with severity level "Notice" will appear in the Alarm Console mentioning that all redundancy resources are in use.

By default, that alarm is cleared as soon as one of the backup elements is available again. However, up to now, in some cases, the alarm would incorrectly not get cleared.
