## Changes

### Fixes

#### BrokerGateway: Issues related to certificates [ID 44195]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU11] - FR 10.5.12 [CU2] -->

Up to now, in some cases, issues related to certificates could cause `TLS handshake error: remote error: tls: bad certificate` errors to be added to the NATS log file and `Could not connect to the local NATS endpoint on '<IP>'. Please make sure that the nats service is running without issues.` notice alarms to be generated.

From now on, in order to prevent any issues related to certificates, in the following cases, the certificate authority will be either added or updated in the certificate store:

- When adding an agent to the cluster.
- When removing an agent from the cluster.
- When calling NATSRepair.
- When migrating to BrokerGateway.
- When no certificate authorities can be found during BrokerGateway startup.
