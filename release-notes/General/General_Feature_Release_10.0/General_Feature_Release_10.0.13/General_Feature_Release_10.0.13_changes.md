#### BPA test framework: New flag to indicate whether a test can be run against an offline agent in a Failover setup \[ID 27762\]

When you create a BPA test, you can now use the BpaFlags.CanRunOnOfflineAgents flag to indicate whether the test can be run against an offline agent in a Failover setup.

Default: False

#### Long running actions will now be canceled when a DataMiner upgrade finishes \[ID 27765\]

When a DataMiner upgrade finishes (successful or not), from now on, all remaining long running actions will be canceled.

#### Client applications now also get notified when cell alarm levels in the source data tables of direct views change due to updates that do not change the cell value \[ID 27785\]

From now on, client applications displaying direct views will also be notified when cell alarm levels in the source data tables change due to updates that do not change the cell value. (e.g. when a cell in a source table gets masked).

#### Live Sharing Service: Enhanced error handling \[ID 27791\]

A number of enhancements have been made to the overall error handling in the Live Sharing Service.

#### DataMiner Cube: Enhanced consistency of trend graph legends \[ID 27831\]

#### DataMiner Cube - Settings: No longer possible to set Connection type to 'Web services' \[ID 27904\]

Since Web Services Enhancements (WSE) for Microsoft .NET has been deprecated, the only way for DataMiner Cube to connect to a DataMiner Agent is by using .NET Remoting. As a result, in the *Settings* window, it is no longer possible to set the *Computer \> Connection \> Connection type* setting to “Web services”.

#### Service & Resource Management: Deleting resources only allowed when all DMAs in the DMS are reachable \[ID 27921\]

From now on, you will only be allowed to delete resources when all agents in the DMS are reachable. This will prevent deleted resources from re-appearing when a DMA is started up again.

When you try to delete a resource, an error will now be returned in the following circumstances:

- When at least one agent is disconnected from the agent that hosts the resource you are trying to delete.
- When at least one agent is not in a running state.
- When there is at least one agent on which the ResourceManager module is not initialized.

#### DataMiner Jobs: new ResourceFieldDescriptor field \[ID 27922\]

A new *ResourceFieldDescriptor* field is now available for DataMiner jobs. This field requires a GUID value, which should be the GUID of a resource. It also has a *ResourcePoolIds* property which can be used to filter resources based on resource pools. This feature is intended to support the upcoming PLM app.

#### Performance enhancement: An element card page containing a direct view table will only show the alarm severity of that table when the page is opened \[ID 27928\]

When you open an element card, pages containing direct view tables will no longer show the alarm severity of those tables. Only when you open a page containing a direct view table will the alarm severity of that table be calculated and displayed.

#### DataMiner Jobs: New DefaultValue property of FieldDescriptor class \[ID 27934\]

The *FieldDescriptor* class for DataMiner jobs now has a new *DefaultValue* property, so that it is now possible to add a default field value to each FieldDescriptor. This feature is intended to support the upcoming PLM app.

#### DataMiner Cube: Enhanced performance when opening the Reports page of a view card \[ID 27937\]

Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when opening the Reports page of a view card, especially when that page shows a large amount of elements with heatlines (e.g. the root view).

#### Service & Resource Management: ResourcesNotMatchWithServiceDefinition check removed \[ID 27938\]

The ResourcesNotMatchWithServiceDefinition check has been removed.

As a result, an error will no longer be returned when saving a ServiceReservationInstance where the booked resources do not match the functions or virtual functions required by the ServiceDefinition.

#### Service & Resource Management: New VirtualFunctionID property added to NodeDefinition class \[ID 27953\]

A new *VirtualFunctionID* property is now available for *NodeDefinition* objects for service profiles.

When a service profile definition is created, DataMiner will check if the virtual function ID exists. If it does not exist, a new error reason *InvalidVirtualFunctionDefinitions* will be added in the trace data. The property *InvalidVirtualFunctionIDs* of the trace data will be filled in with the non-existing virtual function IDs. The property *ServiceProfileDefinition* of the trace data will allow you to identify which service profile definition has an error.

Note that this property can currently not yet be configured in DataMiner Cube.

#### Ticketing app: Enhanced 'Edit ticket field' window \[ID 27962\]

Due to a number of enhancements to the *Edit ticket field* window, especially the section that allows you to define the possible values, configuring a ticket state field has been made more intuitive.

#### DataMiner Cube - System Center: Refresh button in Logging section \[ID 27986\]

In the Logging section of System Center, you can now click Refresh to reload the log entries.

#### BPA test framework: Abstraction layer added to allow backward compatibility of BPA tests \[ID 27988\]

An abstraction layer has now been added to the BPA test framework. This will prevent older tests from being rendered incompatible when changes are made to the framework.

#### SLNet.exe.config: TcpWebServicePort key will now be ignored \[ID 27990\]

As Web Services Enhancements (WSE) for Microsoft .NET has been deprecated, in the appSettings section of the SLNet.exe.config file, the TcpWebServicePort key will now be ignored.

#### BPA tests can now be assigned a maximum DataMiner version \[ID 27997\]

When creating a BPA test, it is now possible to indicate the most recent DataMiner version on which the test will work.

When a DataMiner Agent is upgraded to a version equal to or above the one specified in the MaxVersion setting of a test, that test will no longer be executed. Also, you will not be able to upload a BPA test to a DataMiner Agent with a version equal to or above the one specified in the MaxVersion setting.

#### Dashboards app - Parameter feed: 'partial table' renamed to 'paged table' \[ID 28048\]

In the tool tip of the “Select all items” and “Select specific number of items” options, “partial table” has been renamed to “paged table”.

During a Failover switch, in some cases, an error could occur in SLSNMPManager.

#### Jobs app: Problem when no domains were configured \[ID 27635\]

When no domains had been configured, in some cases, the jobs list would incorrectly keep loading. Also, when you refreshed an empty jobs list, a “page not found” error would be displayed.

> [!NOTE]
> Up to now, when no domains were configured, a popup message would be displayed, asking you to create one. From now on, visual indication and a button will be displayed instead.

#### DataMiner Cube: When one client forcefully disconnected another client, the latter would incorrectly reconnect \[ID 27638\]\[ID 27671\]

When two different Cube clients were connected to the same DataMiner Agent, and one forcefully disconnected the other, up to now, that forceful disconnection would incorrectly be considered as abnormal, causing the disconnected client to immediately reconnect.

From now on, when one client forcefully disconnects another client, the disconnection will be treated as a forceful logout instead.

#### Problem with excessive memory usage of SLDataGateway and SLNet during DataMiner startup \[ID 27658\]

When a DataMiner Agent with a Cassandra database had experienced two days of high alarm activity, in some cases, SLDataGateway and SLNet would start to use excessive amounts of memory after DataMiner startup.

On a system using automatic incident tracking on which DataMiner Infrastructure Discovery Provisioning (IDP) was deployed, in some cases, when the IDP location of an element with active alarms was removed, that location would not be removed correctly. This would cause certain alarms to be grouped by an empty location.

> [!NOTE]
> From now on, IDP location grouping requires that the *Make this property available for alarm filtering* option is activated for the following element properties: IDP, Location Name, Location Building, Location Floor, Location Room, Location Aisle and Location Rack.

#### Service & Resource Management: Problem when rebinding a VirtualFunctionResource \[ID 27735\]

When a VirtualFunctionResource was unbound, in some cases, it would still be processing parameter sets from its bound element. This would cause the parameters of the unbound element to no longer be in an “uninitialized” state. Instead, they would incorrectly stay set to the last received value from the bound element.

#### Interactive Automation scripts: MinWidth, MaxWidth, MinHeight and MaxHeight properties of UIBlock components would not be parsed correctly \[ID 27736\]

#### Dashboards app - Pivot table component: Problem with conditions \[ID 27897\]

When a pivot table component had conditions configured, in some cases, those conditions would incorrectly only work in conjunction with table column parameters, not with single-value parameters.

Also, a selection box problem could occur when multiple conditions were configured in the “Configure indices” section.

#### Automation: Problem when retrieving information events from all DMAs \[ID 27903\]

When, in a DataMiner System with multiple agents, information events were retrieved by an Automation script, in some cases, not all information events would be retrieved.

#### Dashboards app - Time range component: Default range would be used even after being overwritten afterwards \[ID 27941\]

If the default values of a time range component had been set to a custom range, in some cases, those values would incorrectly still be used after being overwritten afterwards (e.g. by means of URL arguments or another feed).

#### DataMiner Cube - Bookings app: Memory leak when opening the Signal Path tab \[ID 27952\]

In some cases, DataMiner Cube could leak memory each time you opened the Signal Path tab when configuring a booking in the Bookings app.

## Addendum CU1

### CU1 fixes

#### SLWatchDog2.txt: Total number of processes of which at least one thread has a runtime error was incorrectly replaced by total number of threads with a runtime error \[ID 28360\]

Each time a runtime error occurs, an entry is added to the SLWatchDog2.txt log file, showing the total number of processes of which at least one thread has a runtime error.

However, in some cases, that log entry would incorrectly show the total number of threads with a runtime error instead.

#### Failover: Configuration issues \[ID 28378\]

In a Failover setup, in some cases, an error could occur when no ElasticSearch database was found.

Also, in some cases, configuration updates would be ignored after a Failover switch.
