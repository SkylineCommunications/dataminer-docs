> For information on how to upgrade DataMiner, see [Upgrading a DataMiner Agent](xref:Upgrading_a_DataMiner_Agent).

## New features

### DMS Protocols

#### A message body can now be added to raw HTTP requests \[ID 27438\]

In a QAction, it is now possible to add a message body to raw HTTP requests sent in a multithreaded timer.

Old syntax:

```csharp
object[] httpRequestInfo = new object[3] { "http", new string[6] { sVerb, sURL, sUser, sPass, httpHeaders, "200" }, new string[1] { httpCommand } };
```

New syntax:

```csharp
object[] httpRequestInfo = new object[3] { "http", new string[6] { sVerb, sURL, sUser, sPass, httpHeaders, "200" }, new object[1] { new string[2] { httpCommand, dataToSend } } };
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The old syntax can still be used. If you use the old syntax, no message bodies will be sent. If you use the new syntax for a single resource, no message body needs to be added. In that case, you should define an empty string instead.
> - By adding the message bodies to the last array in the request, the new syntax allows you to send a different message body to each of the different subpages.
> - Using the new syntax, the last array can be an object array of string arrays of size 2:
>   - The first part of each string array is the subpage to which the request needs to be sent.
>   - The second part of each string array is the message body that needs to be sent to that specific subpage.
> - DataMiner does not format the given message body in any way. It is forwarded as received from within the QAction. It is up to the user to correctly format the message body.

#### Updating direct views showing data from elements on remote DMAs \[ID 27547\]

From now on, DirectView updates are supported in the following scenarios:

- DirectView based on a view of the same protocol

    Example:

    ```xml
    Protocol: view=200;directView=905 table config;view=201 column config or view=211:305
    ```

- DirectView based on a view of the same protocol with a single element source.

    Example:

    ```xml
    directView=6298 Pointing to a standalone parameter rather than a column parameter
    ```

- onlyFilteredDirectView based on a view of the same protocol

    > [!NOTE]
    > onlyFilteredDirectView will only return data when a filtered subscription is made on the directView.

- DirectView based on a different protocol

    Example:

    ```xml
    filterChange=DirectViewColumnID A-RemoteDataColumnID A, DirectViewColumnID B-RemoteDataColumnID B, ...
    ```

- DirectView based on a different protocol with a filter specifying the element sources to be included.

    Example:

    ```xml
    directView=6505 => FILTER: value=6501 == REMOTE-DATA-1
    ```

### DMS Cube

#### Alarm Console: Alarm events without a severity change can now be consolidated in the preceding event in the alarm tree \[ID 23234\]\[ID 23526\]\[ID 24462\]\[ID 27413\]

From now on, when an alarm tree contains alarm events that did not change the severity, these events can be consolidated in the previous event.

When you open an alarm card that shows an alarm tree containing consolidated events, you can click *Show all alarm updates* to have the tree expanded to show all events.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The maximum alarm limit is calculated after alarm event consolidation.
> - Alarm consolidation is disabled by default. To enable it, add an *AlarmSettings.MustSquashAlarms* element to the *MaintenanceSettings.xml* file, and set its value to True.

#### Profiles app: Converters \[ID 27264\]

In the *Profiles* app, it is now possible to configure a converter (i.e. a mediation snippet) for a parameter linked to a profile parameter.

To configure a converter, do the following:

1. Open the *Profiles* app and go to the *Parameters* tab.

1. Open a parameter (or create a new one).

1. In the *Linked with* table at the bottom, add, edit or duplicate an entry.

1. In the *Edit link with protocol* box, activate the *Converter* setting, enter the converter code in the code window, and click *OK*.

   In the *Linked with* table, the *Converter* column will now show either the class name of the converter or, if no class name could be found, the first line of the converter code.

1. Click *Save* to apply the changes you made.

> [!NOTE]
> When you edit a linked parameter with a converter, the *Converter* setting will automatically be activated.

#### Elements hosted by a disconnected DMA will now be indicated as being disconnected \[ID 27313\] \[ID 27613\]

Up to now, when a DataMiner Agent disconnected from the DataMiner System, the elements hosted by it would disappear from the Cube’s Surveyor. From now on, they will remain visible (read-only), and will be indicated as being disconnected by means of a special icon.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The cache is not persistent.
>   - When the disconnected DMA restarts, its elements will no longer be available to the other DMAs in the DMS.
>   - When another DMA joins the DMS, the elements of the disconnected DMA will not be available to the new DMA.
> - Any messages sent to the disconnected DMA (e.g. to retrieve or update information) will result in an exception being thrown.

#### DataMiner Cube will now always connect to a DataMiner Agent via .NET Remoting \[ID 27354\]

Up to now, DataMiner Cube could use either .NET Remoting or Web Services to connect to a DataMiner Agent. However, as Web Services Enhancements (WSE) for Microsoft .NET is now deprecated, from now on the only way for DataMiner Cube to connect to a DataMiner Agent is by using .NET Remoting.

#### Trending: Renaming of trend prediction types \[ID 27435\]

On a system with a Cassandra database, trend graphs can show how the value of a parameter in the graph is most likely to evolve in the future. Four types of trend prediction can be displayed. Those types have now been renamed.

| Old name   | New name       |
|------------|----------------|
| Short-term | High precision |
| Mid-term   | Short-term     |
| Long-term  | Mid-term       |
| Full-term  | Long-term      |

Also, the behavior of the “auto” setting has been enhanced.

#### DataMiner Cube is now able to detect table columns containing MAC addresses \[ID 27503\]

DataMiner Cube is now able to detect table columns containing MAC addresses and to sort them appropriately.

#### Trending: Ignore gaps option in export window \[ID 27506\]

When you export a trend graph to CSV, a new *Ignore gaps* option is now available. If you select this option, the export will skip any gaps in the trend data.

#### Trending: Percentile line \[ID 27533\]

It is now possible to visualize a percentile line on a trend graph in DataMiner Cube. To do so, right-click the graph and select *Show percentile*. By default, the 95th percentile for the data in the current range will then be calculated and visualized with a line on the graph. To the right of the line, you will see the percentile that was calculated and the value of the percentile.

If the range of the graph is adapted, the percentile is not automatically updated, so that you can compare the percentile for a certain range with the data for a larger or smaller time frame. The percentile line will be displayed as a full line over the range for which it was originally displayed, and as a dashed line over the rest of the graph.

When you click the percentile line, a refresh option is displayed that allows you to refresh the percentile to the currently displayed data. Clicking the line also displays the option to adjust the percentile, so that you can e.g. display the 90th percentile instead.

Finally, in the *Trending* tab of the Cube user settings, a new *Show percentile* setting is now available, which can be used to have the percentile line displayed by default whenever a trend graph is opened. If this option is selected, you can also select which percentile should be calculated by default.

#### Alarm Console: FilterElement property of an alarm hyperlink can now include a filter that checks the existence of a dictionary key \[ID 27675\]

A new exposer will now allow filters to check whether a certain key exists in a dictionary.

```csharp
// Filter to check if a key exists
var keyFilter = AlarmEventMessageExposers.PropertiesDict.KeyExists("KeyName").Equal(true);
// Filter to check if a key does not exist
var keyFilter = AlarmEventMessageExposers.PropertiesDict.KeyExists("KeyName").Equal(false);
```

In Alarm Console hyperlinks, these filters can be used in the FilterElement property. See the following example.

```xml
<HyperLink id="1" version="2" name="Issue_ID blank" type="script" alarmColumn="true" menu="root/JIRA" combineParameters="true" filterElement= "(AlarmEventMessage.PropertiesDict.KeyExists:Issue_ID[Bool] == False) OR (AlarmEventMessage.PropertiesDict.Issue_ID[String]=='')">
  Script:dummy script||||Tooltips|NoConfirmation,CloseWhenFinished
</HyperLink>
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - This type of filters will be applied after the data has been retrieved from the database.
> - It is not recommended to use these filters when retrieving data from Cassandra or ElasticSearch.

#### Name of the DataMiner System can now be displayed in Cube’s header bar \[ID 27714\]

In DataMiner Cube, the name of the DataMiner System can now be displayed in the header bar.

- Open the header bar’s quick menu, and activate or deactivate the *Show cluster name* setting.

    or

- Open the *Settings* window, go to *Computer \> Cube*, and select or clear the *Display cluster name in header* setting.

### DMS Reports & Dashboards

#### Dashboards app: New 'Enable pinning as quick pick' option + support for timespans as input for time range feed \[ID 27357\]

In the Dashboards app, if the layout option *Use quick picks* is selected for a time range component, you can now enable the additional option *Enable pinning as quick pick*. When you do so, a pin icon is displayed next to the time summary in the component. Clicking the icon will add the current time selection as a custom quick pick button. If the current time selection matches the custom quick pick button, clicking the pin icon again will remove the button. You can also remove the button using the garbage can icon on the button itself.

The custom quick pick button is saved on component level, which means it will remain displayed when the dashboard is refreshed, until it is manually removed.

As an additional change, the time range feed has been updated to also accept timespans as input data now. Adding a timespan as input will set the active time range in the feed.

#### Dashboards app: Selecting an empty folder will now cause an 'Add a new dashboard' button to appear \[ID 27362\]

When, in the sidebar of the Dashboards app, you select an empty folder, an *Add a new dashboard* button will now appear in the large pane on the right.

Clicking that button will allow you to create a new dashboard in the folder you selected.

#### Dashboards app: Support for table column parameter as input for State component \[ID 27463\]

When you use a table column parameter as input for a State component in the Dashboards app, it will now display the state for all indices of the column. Optionally, you can add an indices filter in order to display specific indices only.

#### Ordering of data entries used in a dashboard component \[ID 27486\]

For dashboard components that can display multiple data entries and for which it makes sense to modify the order in which these entries are displayed (e.g. State components, Parameter table components, etc.), in the *Data* pane, a new *Data used in component* section is available. This section lists the different data entries used by the selected component, with arrow icons on the right that can be used to change the order in which the entries are displayed.

#### Dashboards app: Support for quick filters of tables in visual overview components \[ID 27517\]

Quick filters are now supported for tables within a visual overview component of a dashboard. The following (case-insensitive) syntax is supported for the filters:

- {column name}{operator}{value}
- {column name}{operator}regex{operator}{regex value}
- {column name}{operator}severity{operator}{alarmstate}
- regex{operator}{regex value}
- severity{operator}{alarmstate}

The following operators are supported in this syntax:

- : (contains)
- !:
- =
- !=
- ==
- !==
- \<=
- \>=
- \>
- \<

#### Dashboard theme configuration improvements \[ID 27553\]

The following improvements have been implemented to dashboard themes:

- It is now possible to customize the colors for the lines displayed in a trend graph. You can do so on dashboard level, by customizing the theme, or on component level, by customizing the component theme. In either case, the colors can be configured under *Color* > *Color palette*.

- While previously, customizing the dashboard theme within a dashboard only provided limited options compared to the theme configuration in the settings of the Dashboards app, now a *New theme* button is available in the dashboard *Layout* pane, which will open a pop-up window where you can fully configure a new theme.

#### Dashboard Gateway \[ID 27558\]

A new Dashboard Gateway now gives users access to the Dashboards app as well as to all other DataMiner web applications (Monitoring, Ticketing, Jobs, etc.) even if they do not have access to DataMiner.

There are two main reasons to consider a Dashboard Gateway setup:

- Security

  Users are allowed to connect to the Dashboard Gateway, but not to the DataMiner Agents directly. Also, it is possible to install only the web applications on the Dashboard Gateway web server(s) to which you want users to have access. If you only install the Dashboards and the Monitoring app, users will not be able to access the Jobs app, the Ticketing or any other app.

- Performance

  Allowing multiple users to connect to the web applications increases the overall load on the DataMiner Agents. When using a Dashboard Gateway, the direct load of the web applications and the HTTP requests shifts to a separate web server, leaving more resources available on the DataMiner Agents. Also, if more performance is needed, multiple Dashboard Gateway web servers can be used in combination with a load balancer.

Requirements:

- At least one web server (running Windows Server)
- A valid SSL certificate signed by a public certificate authority for the FQDN of the Dashboard Gateway (e.g. “gateway.mycompany.com”)
- A DataMiner user account with

  - access to all views, elements and alarms,
  - permission to access the Alarm Console and Data Display, and
  - permission to create, edit and delete dashboards.

- The Dashboard Gateway web server(s) should be able to communicate with a DMA using both a .NET Remoting connection and an HTTP(S) connection (using port 80 or 443, depending on the HTTP(S) configuration of the DataMiner Agent)

Configuration:

1. On the Dashboard Gateway web server(s), install IIS and the URL Rewrite module.

    For IIS, make sure to install Classic ASP, ASP.NET 4.6+, and the WebSocket protocol.

1. In IIS Manager, import the certificate, and update the site binding to use HTTPS with this certificate.

1. Configure URL Rewrite to forward all HTTP traffic to HTTPS

1. From a DataMiner Agent, copy the C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Webpages\\API folder to the web root folder of the Dashboard Gateway web server (default: C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot) and, in IIS Manager, convert the API into an application.

1. From a DataMiner Agent, copy over the web application(s) (e.g. C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Webpages\\Dashboard, C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Webpages\\Monitoring, C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Webpages\\Jobs, C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Webpages\\Ticketing, etc.) to the web root folder of the Dashboard Gateway web server.

1. On the Dashboard Gateway web server, edit the web.config in the API folder, and specify the following settings:

   | Setting          | Description                                                                                                              |
   |--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | connectionString   | Host name or IP address of the DataMiner Agent to which the Dashboard Gateway has to connect.                            |
   | connectionUser     | DataMiner user account that the Dashboard Gateway has to use to connect to the DataMiner Agent (user name and password). |
   | connectionPassword |                                                                                                                          |

Known limitations:

- The URL folder structure of the web applications should remain the same as on a DataMiner Agent. The applications have to be accessed using the following URL:

  ```txt
  https://gateway.somecompany.com/dashboard
  https://gateway.somecompany.com/monitoring
  https://gateway.somecompany.com/ticketing
  https://gateway.somecompany.com/jobs
  ```

- The DataMiner user account used by the Dashboard Gateway web server should not have multifactor authentication enabled.

### DMS Automation

#### Interactive Automation scripts: Support for datetime values in ISO 8601 format \[ID 27565\]

The UIResults.GetDateTime method now also supports datetime values in ISO 8601 format.

Up to now, only datetime values in “dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss” were supported.

#### Interactive Automation scripts: TreeViewItem now has an 'IsCollapsed' property \[ID 27567\]

Each TreeViewItem in a TreeView component now has an “IsCollapsed” property.

This will allow clients to determine the initial state of each TreeViewItem when displaying a TreeView

### DMS EPM

#### DataMiner Cube: Long selection box content in EPM filters will automatically wrap to the next line \[ID 27660\]

From now on, long selection box content in EPM filters will automatically wrap to the next line.

### DMS Web Services

#### Web Services API v1: New GetServicesForFilter method \[ID 27412\]

In the web services API v1, the new method *GetServicesForFilter* is now available. It can be used to retrieve a list of services matching a property filter.

### DMS Mobile apps

#### Monitoring app: Visualizing view properties in the Surveyor \[ID 27411\]

Similar to DataMiner Cube, the Monitoring app now also allows you to visualize view properties in the Surveyor.

#### Loading screen of embedded apps will now show a loading indicator instead of the app icon \[ID 27594\]

The loading screen of all mobile apps (Monitoring, Dashboards, Jobs, etc.) will now show a loading indicator instead of the app icon when opened in embedded mode (i.e. using a URL that contains either the embed=true or embedded=true argument).

### DMS Service & Resource Management

#### New helper method: GetEligibleResources \[ID 27609\]

The ResourceManagerHelper now contains a new method that allows you to simultaneously execute multiple eligible resource queries.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Returns the eligible resources for all given contexts. A result can be matched
/// with its context by matching the <see cref="EligibleResourceResult.ForContextId"/>
/// property on the <see cref="EligibleResourceResult"/> with the
/// <see cref="EligibleResourceContext.ContextId"/> of the
/// <see cref="EligibleResourceContext"/>.
/// </summary>
/// <exception cref="ArgumentNullException"><paramref name="contexts"/> is null
/// </exception>
/// <exception cref="ArgumentException"><paramref name="contexts"/> is empty
/// </exception>
/// <param name="contexts">The contexts to calculate the resources for</param>
/// <returns>
/// The result with additional info for all requested contexts that were valid.
/// If one or more contexts were invalid the results for the valid contexts are still
/// returned
/// </returns>
public List<EligibleResourceResult> GetEligibleResources(List<EligibleResourceContext> contexts)
{
    if (contexts == null)
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(contexts));
    if(contexts.Count == 0)
        throw new ArgumentException("At least one context should be provided", nameof(contexts));
    var reqMsg = new GetEligibleResourcesMessage(contexts);
    return InnerGetEligibleResources(reqMsg)?.MultipleResults;
}
```

Also, a number of minor changes were done to make sure that the EligibleResourceResults can be matched to the requested contexts:

- An EligibleResourceContext now has a ContextId, which will automatically be filled in by any constructor.

- When the GetEligibleResources method returns a ReservationInstanceNotFound error or a ServiceNodeResourceUsageNotFound error, the error data will now have an additional  EligibleResourceContextId property. This will allow you to pinpoint any context will faulty data.

### DMS tools

#### SLReset: Factory reset tool \[ID 26026\]\[ID 26408\]\[ID 27227\]

SLReset.exe is a new tool that can be used to fully reset a DataMiner Agent to its state immediately after installation. It is located in the C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Files\\ folder.

##### Optional argument

#### BPA tests can now be run from a Windows command line \[ID 27420\]

BPA tests can now be run from a Windows command line.

Syntax:

```txt
BpaExec.exe -options -- tests
```

Example:

```txt
BpaExec.exe -option1 value -option2 value --<PathToTest1> <PathToTest2>
```

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Improvements to Change Element States Offline tool \[ID 23833\]

Numerous improvements have been implemented to the Change Element States Offline tool:

- The overall layout of the tool has been improved.

- The state of elements is now added as a suffix to element names.

- A CSV and XML export option for element states is now available in the *File* menu.

- A new *Elements by Protocol* tab has been added, with a tree view showing elements by protocol and protocol version. Checkboxes allow the quick selection of all elements in a node of the tree view.

- A search box has been added to make it easier to find elements in the *Elements by Name* and *Elements by Protocol* tabs. The wildcards "\*" (for any number of characters) and "?" (for exactly one character) can be used in this box. The element state can be included in the search

- The Ctrl+A key combination is now supported to select all elements.

#### Logging: More information stored in errorlog.txt file when an error occurs in SLProtocol \[ID 26630\]

When an error occurs in SLProtocol, from now on, more information about that error will be stored in the errorlog.txt log file.

#### DataMiner Cube - Service & Resource Management: Enhanced retrieval of service states \[ID 27202\]\[ID 27484\]

Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when retrieving SRM service states in the Cube Surveyor, the Services app and Visual Overview.

#### BPA Framework: BPA tests can now take corrective actions \[ID 27222\]

BPA tests can now be configured to take corrective actions when issues are detected.

When creating a BPA test capable of taking corrective actions, developers have to do the following:

1. Implement a class that inherits the BpaCorrectiveTest class.

1. Create an implementation of the Verify() method that will return

   - True when no issues were detected, and
   - False when issues were detected.

1. Create an implementation of the CorrectiveAction() method that will return

   - True when the corrective action was performed successfully, and
   - False when issues prevented the action from being performed.

A BPA test that was set to take corrected actions will run the Verify() method, which will run the CorrectiveAction() method in case of failure, and will then run the Verify() method again.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The result returned by a test will tell whether corrective actions were taken and whether they were successful.
> - By default, no corrective actions will be taken in any of the tests that are run, unless requested in the beginning of the test run.

#### DataMiner Cube - Router Control: Enhanced configuration of input/output filters of custom matrices \[ID 27253\]

A number of enhancements have been made with regard to the configuration of input and output filters of custom matrices.

#### Scope of BPA test should now always be specified \[ID 27276\]

Before running a BPA test, the scope of the test should now always be specified using the *bpaRunmode* setting:

| If you specify...      | then...                                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| BpaRunMode.ClusterOnly | the test(s) will be run on all agents in the DMS. |
| BpaRunMode.LocalOnly   | the test(s) will be run on the local agent only.  |

#### Service & Resource Management - Profile parameters: Default value of 'IsOptional' field has changed from 'Undefined' to 'Yes' \[ID 27286\]

Up to now, the *IsOptional* field of a profile parameter was by default set to “Undefined”. From now on, this field will by default be set to “Yes”.

#### Only the most recent synchronization file will now be kept in the 'C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\system cache\\sync' folder \[ID 27323\]

To prevent too many synchronization files from getting stored in the “C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\system cache” folder, from now on, only the most recent file will be kept in the “C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\system cache\\sync” subfolder.

Whenever a file is added to this folder, all files older than a day will automatically be deleted.

#### Dashboards app: Enhanced tool tip icons \[ID 27331\]
