Overall performance has increased due to a number of enhancements made to the locking behavior of the SLElement EPM cache.

#### DataMiner Installer will now automatically select a checkbox to create an additional DataMiner user when not being executed by a user with administrative privileges \[ID 25414\]

From now on, if DataMiner Installer is not being executed by a user with administrative privileges, it will automatically select a checkbox to add the current user to the DataMiner Administrators group. This will ensure that at least one user account is available to log in to DataMiner when the installation has finished.

#### SLPort logging enhancements \[ID 25806\]

A number of enhancements have been made to the SLPort logging.

#### Trend icons now determined based on trend window duration \[ID 26030\]

To improve the efficiency of the SLAnalytics process, it now determines the trend icon based on the trend window duration of the parameter.

#### Enhanced communication between agents using HTTP and agents using HTTPS \[ID 26122\]

A number of enhancements have been made with regard to inter-agent communication within a DataMiner System, especially between agents using HTTP and agents using HTTPS.

#### Trend data pattern matching: Enhanced performance \[ID 26174\]\[ID 26219\]\[ID 27001\]

Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when matching patterns in trend data.

#### SLAnalytics: Enhanced logging \[ID 26335\]

A number of enhancements have been made to the SLAnalytics logging.

#### BPA files will now be synchronized among all agents in a DataMiner System \[ID 26360\]

Files related to Best Practice Analysis (BPA) tests will now be synchronized among all agents in a DataMiner System.

#### Element fields now accept pipe characters and tab characters \[ID 26425\]

When adding or updating an element, it is now allowed to enter pipe characters (“\|”) and tab characters in the fields of that element.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - By default, DataMiner Cube will automatically replace tab characters by spaces.
> - Tab characters in port settings could cause problems when exporting or importing to or from a CSV file.

#### Mobile Gateway: Text messages can now contain special characters like '&' \[ID 26449\]

When DataMiner is configured to use an IP-based cell phone modem (e.g. SMSEagle), it communicates with the device via HTTP GET requests, passing values as ampersand-delimited parameters in the URL.

Up to now, when DataMiner sent a text message containing an ampersand character (“&”), the message would be cut off because the ampersand was incorrectly interpreted as a delimiter. From now on, all text messages will be URL encoded.

#### DataMiner Cube: Enhanced Back/Forward navigation \[ID 26457\]

Up to now, clicking the *Back* and *Forward* buttons would only make you jump from one card to another. From now on, also the navigation history within a card will be taken into account.

For example, when you drill down from a card page to a parameter, clicking *Back* will bring you back to that card page, and when you open the trend page of a table cell from within a Visio page, clicking *Back* will bring you back to that Visio page.

Also, when you hover over a *Back* or *Forward* button, a tool tip will now show the name of the card and the page that will be opened.

#### Cube Launcher: Enhancements \[ID 26482\]\[ID 26577\]\[ID 26584\]\[ID 26746\]

A number of enhancements have been made to the Cube Launcher:

- In the *New DataMiner System* window, you can now press ENTER instead of clicking the *Connect* button.

- When you click the cogwheel button at the bottom, you can now click *View logging* to open the folder containing the log files of the Cube Launcher:

    `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Skyline\DataMiner\DataMinerCube\Logs`

- Retrieving and saving temporary Cube settings has been optimized.

- Enhanced animations.

#### Jobs app: Possible to update or delete values of drop-down fields in unused job sections \[ID 26503\]

From now on, if a job section is not being used by a job, it will be possible to update or delete values of drop-down fields in that section.

If you try to update or delete values of drop-down fields in sections that are being used, an error message will appear.

#### Applications using system files to be updated during a DataMiner upgrade will now forcefully be terminated \[ID 26505\]

When updating system files during a DataMiner upgrade, the SLReplace process will now forcefully terminate any application that is using the files to be updated.

#### DataMiner Cube - Failover: When you chose to disable the Failover configuration, it is now also possible to select 'Cancel' \[ID 26509\]

In the Failover configuration window, up to now, when you chose to disable the Failover configuration, you were only able to select *Yes* or *No*. From now on, it is also possible to select *Cancel*.

#### DataMiner Cube - Service & Resource Management: Users will now clearly be notified when trying to configure or manage service profiles when no Indexing Engine is installed \[ID 26534\]

Since DataMiner 10.0.0, service definitions and service profiles can only be used on systems with an Indexing Engine. From now on, when no Indexing Engine is installed, DataMiner Cube will clearly indicate that it is not possible to configure service profiles in the Profiles app nor to manage them in the Services app.

#### Jobs app: Minor enhancements \[ID 26535\]

In the Jobs app, a number of minor enhancements have been made:

- When creating a new domain or updating the name of an existing domain, the domain name will now be trimmed. Any leading and trailing whitespace characters will be removed before the domain name is saved.

- Up to now, names of job templates had to be unique across the entire Jobs app. From now on, they only have to be unique within a specific domain.

- Up to now, when you changed the type of a job field that was being used in a job, in some cases, the value of the “Show in list view” option would incorrectly be changed. From now on, the value of this option will be left untouched.

#### Security checks for local connections between an SLxxx module and SLNet \[ID 26544\]

For local connections between an SLxxx module (e.g. SLDMS) and SLNet, security checks have been established. A security token will be generated and verified for each of the messages that are sent.

#### Dashboards app - Line chart component: Loading indicator next to button to expand or collapse the trend graph legend \[ID 26557\]

Up to now, when data was being loaded into a line chart component, a loading indicator would replace the button to expand or collapse the legend. As a result, it was not possible to expand or collapse the legend while data was being loaded. From now on, when data is being loaded into a line chart component, a loading indicator will be displayed next to the button to expand or collapse the legend.

#### Automation: DataMiner will now check whether a parameter’s set range has not been changed dynamically \[ID 26574\]

When a parameter is set, from now on, DataMiner will check whether the set range of the parameter in question has not been changed dynamically (e.g. by an Automation script).

#### General security enhancements \[ID 26620\]

A number of enhancements have been made with regard to user permissions needed to retrieve or modify data on DataMiner Systems.

#### Dashboards app: Parameter feed enhancements \[ID 26627\]

Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance of the parameter feed has increased, especially when using it in conjunction with parameter table, pivot table and line chart components.

#### DataMiner Cube - Service & Resource Management: Enhanced error messages \[ID 26629\]

Throughout DataMiner Cube, a number of error messages related to Service & Resource Management have been rewritten to make them clearer and more user-friendly.

#### Trending: Increased limit for trend values of type Double to be converted to scientific notation strings \[ID 26646\]

In the database, trend values are stored as text strings.

Up to now, all values of type Double with a length of more than 6 characters were converted to a scientific notation string (e.g. “1e07”). From now on, only values of type Double with a length of more than 12 characters will be converted to a scientific notation string.

#### DataMiner Cube - Automation: All parameters will now be aligned vertically \[ID 26665\]

When creating or updating an Automation script in the Automation app, the parameters will now all be aligned vertically.

#### Improved logging in case client is disconnected \[ID 26667\]

If a client application tries to send a request to a DMA that has already destroyed the client connection, or when the client application checks the connection and finds that it no longer exists, now the log information will mention that the connection was closed with the time when it was closed and the reason it was closed. Previously, logging only mentioned "no such connection" in this case.

#### Cube Launcher: Enhanced host name validation when adding a DMS \[ID 26668\]

When adding a new DataMiner System to Cube Launcher, the host name you enter will now be validated. This will prevent launch buttons from being disabled when a host name is invalid.

#### Enhanced performance when notifying SLElement of service updates \[ID 26674\]

Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when notifying SLElement of service updates.

#### DataMiner Cube - System Center: 'Include SLNet' checkbox removed from restart confirmation window \[ID 26685\]

When, in the *Agents* section of *System Center*, you clicked *(Re)start* to restart a DataMiner Agent, up to now, it was possible to select the *Include SLNet* checkbox in the confirmation window.

This checkbox has now been removed.

#### Jobs app: No longer possible to edit or delete hidden job sections \[ID 26687\]

In configuration mode, up to now, it was possible to not only unhide a hidden section, but also to edit or delete it. From now on, it will only be possible to unhide hidden sections. It will no longer be possible to edit or delete hidden sections.

#### Cube Launcher: Configurations will now be synchronized in real time among different instances \[ID 26699\]

When different instances of Cube Launcher are running simultaneously, they will now synchronize their configurations in real time.

#### Jobs app: Enhanced label behavior in timeline view \[ID 26727\]

A number of enhancements have been made to the way in which labels are visualized in the timeline view.

Also, the custom time filter will now correctly update when zooming in or out.

#### Cube Launcher: Enhanced host name validation \[ID 26752\]

When you add a new DataMiner Agent or DataMiner System to Cube Launcher, the host name you enter will now be validated as follows:

- Is it a valid IP address or host name?

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the host name cannot be validated, you will be able to add it, but a warning message will appear.

- Is it accessible over HTTP and/or HTTPS?

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the DMA is accessible over HTTPS, the configuration will be modified to make sure Cube will always connect to that agent over HTTPS. However, if there are any issues with the HTTPS certificate, those issues will be indicated and HTTP will be used instead.

- Is it a DataMiner Agent?

#### Cube Launcher application will appear under the name 'DataMiner Cube' \[ID 26788\]

When you start the Cube Launcher tool, the application will be shown as “DataMiner Cube” in e.g. the Windows Task Manager.

#### Problem with logging of SLManagedScripting \[ID 26796\]

In some cases, the log file of the SLManagedScripting process would incorrectly keep on growing. From now on, all logging of the SLManagedScripting process will be handled by SLLog.

#### DataMiner Cube: Property values in Custom tab of Properties window will now be prevented from updating automatically when a user is manually editing property values \[ID 26825\]

The values of the custom properties listed in the *Custom* tab of a *Properties* window are constantly being updated in real time. As this would sometimes cause problems when a user was manually updating one of those properties, from now on, real-time updates of custom properties listed in the *Custom* tab of the *Properties* window will be suspended as long as a user is manually editing property values in that same tab.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Enhanced performance when closing alarm tabs \[ID 26826\]

Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when closing an alarm tab, especially when all alarms in that tab are selected.

#### DataMiner Cube -Trending: Enhanced retrieval of histogram intervals \[ID 26833\]

A number of enhancements have been made to the way in which histogram intervals are retrieved.

#### DataMiner Cube - System Center: Enhanced saving of backup settings \[ID 26858\]

A number of enhancements have been made to the way in which the backup settings are saved in the *Backup* section of *System Center*.

#### Alarm template information events no longer generated upon element/DMA restart \[ID 26862\]

Previously, when an alarm template was configured to generate information events for specific values, these information events would also be generated each time the element or the DMA restarted. Now such information events will only be generated at runtime.

#### DataMiner Cube: Enhanced performance when processing parameter updates and calculating service statistics \[ID 26863\]

Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased, especially when processing parameter updates and calculating service statistics.

#### SLAnalytics: Enhanced logging \[ID 26884\]

A number of enhancements have been made to the SLAnalytics logging.

#### SLLogCollector now targets Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 \[ID 26888\]

SLLogCollector now targets Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2.

#### Analytics settings from cluster now applied when new DMA joins DMS \[ID 26904\]

When a new DMA joins a DMS, the DMA will now be updated with the DataMiner Analytics settings from the DMS. Previously, the most recently updated settings were synced in the DMS, which meant that if the new DMA had been updated more recently, its settings were used for the rest of the DMS when it joined.

#### Raw value displayed if string value of analog parameter could not be parsed as double \[ID 26909\]

If a string value of an analog parameter could not be parsed as double, since DataMiner 10.0.9, "0" would be displayed as the default fallback value. However, as some older drivers relied on the previous behavior, now the raw value will be displayed again instead.

#### Analytics configuration file updated after DMA leaves cluster \[ID 26912\]

When a DMA is taken out of a cluster, its analytics configuration file will now be renamed to reflect this change. However, note that to prevent issues in case the DMA is added to the cluster again, we strongly recommend to restart the DMA after it leaved the cluster.

#### Lazy loading of cards in tab layout \[ID 26920\]

To improve memory usage and performance, when you open a saved workspace with multiple cards in a tab layout, each card will only be initialized once it has been selected. The same applies when cards are loaded when you log in to Cube.

#### Cube launcher now updated silently after connection to DMS with higher DataMiner version \[ID 26944\]

When you connect to a DMS with a higher DataMiner version than the currently installed version, the Cube launcher is now updated silently, without a pop-up message.

#### Improved graph layout of service RCA chains \[ID 26945\]

An improved algorithm is now used to draw the graph of the RCA chain of a service. This will better prevent overlapping connections and connections running through nodes.

#### Service & Resource Management: Wildcard supported for protocol version in ProtocolLinks of VirtualFunctionDefinition \[ID 26966\]

In the list of *ProtocolLinks* of a *VirtualFunctionDefinition*, an asterisk ('"\*") can now be used as a wildcard character in a protocol version. However, the wildcard can only be specified at the end of the version.

#### DataMiner mobile apps updated to Angular 9 \[ID 26975\]

The DataMiner mobile apps that use Angular, e.g. the Monitoring, Dashboards and Jobs app, now use Angular 9 instead of Angular 8.

#### Opening Cube launcher via system tray icon can now restore existing minimized window \[ID 27006\]

When a Cube launcher window was opened and minimized, opening the launcher again using the system tray icon will restore the existing window.

#### Jobs app: Section definition can now be removed completely \[ID 27025\]

Up to now, when you deleted a section definition, this only broke the link between the section definition and the job domain, so that technically, the section definition still existed in the database.

Now the following methods in the DataMiner Web Services API allow the deletion of a section definition from the job domain and the complete deletion of the domain itself:

- *DeleteJobsSectionDefinition*: This method will try to remove a section definition from the database. In case the section definition is used in other domains, it will try to remove all the links in those domains first. If this fails, any changes will be reverted and an error will be thrown.

- *DeleteJobsDomain*: This method will now remove the domain and all its section definitions as well, unless these are linked to other domains.

In the Jobs app itself, when a user tries to delete a section definition, a dialog box is now displayed, asking whether only the link with the current domain should be removed or whether the section definition should be removed entirely.

#### DataMiner Cube: Embedded DataMiner apps now always use Chromium browser \[ID 27052\]

All DataMiner apps displayed within an embedded web browser in DataMiner Cube (e.g. Ticketing, Dashboards, Reports, Annotations, etc.) will now always use the Chromium browser engine, regardless of which default browser engine is configured.

#### Alarm when Cassandra or Elasticsearch database go offline \[ID 27061\]

When the Cassandra or Elasticsearch database go offline, an alarm is now generated in DataMiner. In the alarm details, it will show exactly which storage is in file offload mode while the database is offline.

### Fixes

#### Problem with spectrum session presets reverting to the default settings \[ID 26043\]

After restarting a DMA, in some cases, spectrum session presets could revert to the default settings if a card was open in a Cube connected through another DMA.

#### After a hotfix installation, the version number in VersionHistory.txt would be updated incorrectly \[ID 26067\]

After a hotfix installation, in some cases, the version number in the VersionHistory.txt file would incorrectly be updated with the word “Hotfix” instead of the hotfix version string containing the detailed version information (e.g. “HF_10.0.7.0(CU0)\_20200520-135714”).

#### Exceptions related to correlation data flushing would be logged during a DMA startup or Failover switch \[ID 26177\]

During a DMA startup or a Failover switch, in some cases, exceptions related to correlation data flushing would be logged in SLErrors.txt.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: 'Earlier this month' and 'Last month' were sorted incorrectly \[ID 26209\]

When, in the Alarm Console, you sorted and grouped alarms by Time/descending, the “earlier this month” group would incorrectly be sorted after the “last month” group (and vice versa when sorted and grouped by Time/ascending).

#### Problem when restoring a DataMiner backup package containing a database file that took a long time to restore \[ID 26210\]

When you restored a DataMiner backup package (.dmbackup) containing a database file that took more than 30 minutes to restore, in some cases, the restore of the DataMiner backup package would incorrectly continue before the restore of the database file had finished.

#### Problem when using the IsMatrixCrosspointConnected method in an Automation script \[ID 26276\]

When, in an Automation script, the *IsMatrixCrosspointConnected* method was used before a matrix point had been connected, in some cases, an exception could be thrown.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Shapes with a ParameterControl shape data field would incorrectly not take into account the NoAutoScale option \[ID 26283\]

When a Visio page with the NoAutoScale option contained shapes of which the ParameterControl shape data field was set to a value containing dynamic placeholders, in some cases, those shapes would incorrectly not take into account the NoAutoScale option.

#### Problem with SLPort when polling smart-IP elements \[ID 26304\]

In some cases, a memory issue could occur in SLPort when polling smart-IP elements.

#### Some files would not immediately get synchronized when creating a new DataMiner System \[ID 26359\]

#### SLLogCollector tool: LogCollector package would incorrectly not contain any dump files \[ID 26417\]

When a LogCollector package had been made using the SLLogCollector tool, in some cases, that package would incorrectly not contain any dump files.

#### LoggerUtil: Some log entries would not get added to the logs \[ID 26429\]

In some cases, certain log entries would not get added to the logs.

#### Problem when using SNMPv3 credentials from the credential library in conjunction with a non-primary SNMP port \[ID 26435\]

In some cases, an element startup error could be thrown when using SNMPv3 credentials from the credential library in conjunction with a non-primary SNMP port.

#### DataMiner Agent not restarting after processes were stopped \[ID 26440\]

To prevent an Agent from automatically restarting when it is stopped, up to now, DataMiner did not automatically restart when more than 2 processes stopped within a 2-minute timespan. However, this could cause problems if more than 2 processes stopped but the Agent did not stop completely. To prevent this, the Agent will now be restarted when at least one of the following processes is still running: SLDataMiner, SLElement, SLDMS and SLNet.

#### Real-time trend data requested by sending a GetTrendDataMessage would incorrectly contain additional data points beyond the specified end time \[ID 26473\]

When real-time trend data was requested by sending a GetTrendDataMessage, in some cases, the response would incorrectly contain additional data points beyond the specified end time.

#### Service & Resource Management: Problem when retrieving Profile Manager data \[ID 26478\]

When retrieving Profile Manager objects, in some cases, a NULL object would incorrectly be returned.

#### Problem due to duplicate IP addresses in DMS.xml \[ID 26480\]

#### Files in C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\ root folder would not be taken into account when processing FilesToLeave.txt during a DataMiner upgrade \[ID 26489\]

When the FilesToLeave.txt file was processed during a DataMiner upgrade, up to now, the files in the C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\ root folder would incorrectly not be taken into account.

#### Failover: Agent configured to only be switched over manually would incorrectly be switched back to offline automatically in case of failing heartbeats \[ID 26490\]

In some cases, an agent configured to only be switched over manually would incorrectly be switched back to offline automatically in case of failing heartbeats.

#### Automation: Engine#FindElement(null) call would incorrectly return a random element \[ID 26499\]

When using an Engine#FindElement(null) call in an Automation script, in some cases, a random Element object would incorrectly be returned. From now on, NULL will be returned instead.

#### DataMiner Cube - Documents app: Problem when trying to delete a file after saving it locally \[ID 26500\]

When, in the Documents app, you tried to delete a document after saving it to your client computer, in some cases, the document would not disappear from the list and would remain in a “Deleting” state.

#### Memory leak in SLNet \[ID 26507\]

In some cases, the SLNet process would leak memory due to a thread problem.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Problem when grouping alarms by time on the first day of the month \[ID 26511\]

When, on the first day of the month, you opened an alarm tab page with active alarms grouped by time, in some cases, the alarms generated on the last day of the previous month would incorrectly be marked with the day of the week instead of with the word “Yesterday”.

#### SLProtocol would incorrectly not take the pair with the lowest ID when no ping pair was defined in a serial protocol \[ID 26514\]

When, in a serial protocol, no specific pair is defined as the ping pair (in other words: no pair has its group ID set to -1 or has a ping="true" attribute), by default, SLProtocol should take the pair with the lowest ID. However, up to now, it would instead incorrectly take the first pair defined in the protocol.

#### Monitoring app - Visual Overview: Using a SetVar shape would cause two instances of the same control to be displayed on top of each other \[ID 26516\]

When, in the Monitoring app, a SetVar shape were used in a Visio file, two instances of the same control would incorrectly be displayed on top of each other.

#### SLNet handle leaks \[ID 26517\]

In some cases, the SLNet process would experience handle leaks.

#### DataMiner Cube: Problem when trying to refresh a table by clicking the Refresh button \[ID 26521\]

In some cases, it would no longer be possible to manually refresh a table by clicking the *Refresh* button at the top of the table.

#### Dashboards app - CPE feed: A field filtered by a field value lower in the chain would not contain the correct value \[ID 26529\]

When using a CPE feed on a dashboard, in some cases, a field filtered by a field value lower in the chain would not contain the correct value.

#### DataMiner Cube - Services app: Services list would not display the current states of the listed services \[ID 26537\]

#### Ticketing: TicketFieldResolver instances would no longer be synchronized \[ID 26552\]

In some cases, the TicketFieldResolver instances on the different agents in a DataMiner System would incorrectly no longer be synchronized.

#### DataMiner Cube: Visual page of a newly opened card would not get loaded when the new card replaced the contents of an existing card \[ID 26561\]

By default, if you left-click an item in the Surveyor using a card layout other than the tab layout, each new card you open will replace the previous open, docked card. Up to now, when the contents of an open card were replaced, in some cases, the visual page of the new card would not get loaded. It would only be loaded when you selected it after opening another page.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Problem with ColumnWidth option \[ID 26570\]

When, in a shape data field of type ParameterControlOptions, a ColumnWidth option had been specified, in some cases, Visual Overview would incorrectly show an empty table.

- When, in the *General* tab, you selected “SNMPv1” and saved the configuration as is, in some cases, the notification OID would not be saved correctly. By default, it should be set to “User device-specific OID”.

- In case of SNMPv2 or SNMPv3, when the *Notification OID* field was not set to “Use custom bindings” and the *Custom bindings* pane was expanded, the *Delete* button would incorrectly always be enabled. That button should only be enabled when the *Notification OID* field is set to “Use custom bindings” and a custom binding is selected in the list.

#### DataMiner Cube - Multiple set: List of table indices would not be populated when there was no associated read parameter \[ID 26593\]

When you performed a multiple set (i.e. an update of multiple parameter values in one go), up to now, the drop-down box listing the table indices would incorrectly not be populated when there was no associated read parameter (e.g. write parameters linked to buttons displayed in table cells).

#### DataMiner Cube - EPM: KPI list would incorrectly display long column names that included the table name \[ID 26599\]

In a CPE Manager element card, the KPI list would incorrectly display long column names that included the table name. From now on, that list will display short column names.

#### DataMiner Cube - Data Display: Incorrect parameter range validation after the range had been modified via a protocol QAction \[ID 26600\]

When a parameter range had been modified via a protocol QAction, in some cases, the new range would not correctly be validated when the parameter was updated via Data Display.

#### MySQL: DVE child elements would incorrectly not be deleted when the DVE parent element was deleted \[ID 26607\]

When a DVE parent element was deleted from a MySQL database, in some cases, its child elements would incorrectly not be deleted.

#### EPM: Problem when unmasking a tree element \[ID 26612\]
