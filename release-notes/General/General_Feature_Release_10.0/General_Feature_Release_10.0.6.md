## New features

### DMS core functionality

#### Security: LDAP queries will now time out after 5 minutes \[ID 25214\]

From now on, LDAP queries will, by default, time out after 5 minutes.

This setting can be configured in the *DataMiner.xml* file. Enter a value in seconds. If the LDAP.QueryTimeout tag is not present, a default value of 300 seconds (i.e. 5 minutes) will be taken. See the example below.

```xml
<DataMiner>
  <LDAP>
    <QueryTimeout>300</QueryTimeout>
  </LDAP>
</DataMiner>
```

> [!NOTE]
> This timeout applies to every individual LDAP query. As a result, a request to refresh all groups (which consists of multiple requests) could have a total timeout that is much larger than 5 minutes.

#### All DataMiner server DLLs now target Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 \[ID 25269\]

All DataMiner server DLLs now target Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2.

### DMS Cube

#### Data Display: Table column layout can now be customized and saved per table \[ID 22866\]

It is now possible to save the layout of a table column after having customized it.

After changing the width, the position and/or the visibility of a column, right-click its header, and select *Save layout*. To reset the column layout to the default settings, select *Reset layout*.

#### Alarm hyperlinks: \[DisplayValue\] keywords now allows to display the value of a discreet parameter \[ID 25294\]

In second-generation alarm hyperlinks, you can now use the \[DISPLAYVALUE\] keyword to display the value of a discreet parameter.

#### Client machines running Cube now require Microsoft .NET Framework v4.6.2 \[ID 25309\]

Client machines running DataMiner Cube now require Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2.

#### Profiles app: Support for capability parameters of type 'text' \[ID 25345\]

The *Profiles* app now also allows you to create and edit profile parameters of category "Capability" and type "Text".

#### Creating an element simulation file \[ID 25353\]

On a DataMiner System, you can create simulated elements. These elements behave as if they are communicating with a physical device, but in fact they are merely displaying data from a simulation file.

From now on, in Cube, you can not only enable a simulation file, but also create one. To do so, in the navigation pane on the left, right-click the element for which you want to create a simulation file, and select *Actions \> Create simulation*.

When you open an element card, you can also access this same command via the card’s hamburger menu.

The simulation file will be stored on the DataMiner Agent, in the protocol folder of the element in question: `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Protocols\NAME\VERSION\Simulation_ELEMENTNAME.xml`

#### Resources app: Time-dependent capabilities \[ID 25409\]

When, in the *Resources* app, you assign a capability parameter to a resource, instead of specifying a fixed value for that parameter, you can now indicate that its value will be time-dependent, i.e. that the capability of the resource can change over time.

#### Visual Overview: SetVar controls 'ListBox' and 'FilterComboBox' now use virtualization \[ID 25436\]

The SetVar controls "ListBox" and "FilterComboBox" now both use virtualization. This will allow those controls to load large datasets without major performance loss.

#### Visual Overview: Retrieving a booking ID using the \[Reservation:\] placeholder \[ID 25447\]

Using the following syntax, it is now possible to retrieve the ID of a booking by means of a \[Reservation:\] placeholder.

```txt
[reservation:<bookingID/service>,ID]
```

### DMS Reports & Dashboards

#### Dashboards app: CPE feed will only pass along the deepest selected field \[ID 25304\]

From now on, a CPE feed will no longer pass along all selected fields. Instead, it will only pass along the deepest selected field.

### DMS Automation

#### Injecting a DLL into an Automation script \[ID 24945\]

It is now possible to inject DLL files into an Automation script.

##### To inject a DLL

1. Create an *AutomationDllInjectionItem* object that contains the following data:

    | Item     | Description                                                                                              |
    |------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ScriptName | The name of the script into which the DLL will be injected.                                              |
    | ExeId      | The ID of the script action that will be replaced. Note: This script action must be a C# code block. |
    | Path       | The path to the DLL that will be injected. Note: This file must have the extension “.dll”.           |

1. Send the object to the server using an *InjectAutomationDllRequestMessage*.

The server will send back an *InjectAutomationDllResponseMessage*. If any errors would have occurred, they will be included as errors of type *AutomationErrorData* in the message’s *TraceData* object. Possible errors include:

| Value           | Description                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unknown         | An unknown error occurred.                                                                                                                        |
| NotAllowed      | The user who sent the message does not have the correct permissions.                                                                              |
| DllPathInvalid  | The DLL path is invalid. The file does not exist or does not have the extension “.dll”.                                                           |
| NotLicensed     | The DataMiner Agent is not licensed to use the Automation module.                                                                                 |
| InjectionFailed | The injection operation failed in SLAutomation. For more information, check the *SLAutomationErrors* property. |

To determine whether the injection was successful, you can check TraceData.HasSucceeded.

##### To request an overview of the injected DLLs

Send a *GetAutomationDllOverviewRequestMessage* to the server. This message does not have any properties.

The server will send back a *GetAutomationDllOverviewResponseMessage* containing a list of *AutomationDllInjectionItem* objects.

##### To eject a DLL

If you eject a previously injected DLL from an Automation script, this will cause the script to behave as it did before the injection. To do so, send an *EjectAutomationDllRequestMessage* containing the name of the script and the Exe ID (i.e. the ID of the script action).

The server will send back a EjectAutomationDllResponseMessage. If any errors would have occurred, they will be included as errors of type *AutomationErrorData* in the message’s *TraceData* object. Possible errors include:

| Value | Description |
|--|--|
| Unknown | An unknown error occurred. |
| NotAllowed | The user who sent the message does not have the correct permissions. |
| NotLicensed | The DataMiner Agent is not licensed to use the Automation module. |
| EjectionFailed | The ejection operation failed in SLAutomation. For more information, check the *SLAutomationErrors* property. Note: This error will never be returned after injecting a DLL. See “To eject a DLL” below. |

##### To execute a script

Send an ExecuteScriptMessage to the server.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Users who send the above-mentioned messages must have the “Automation \> Edit” permission to be able to inject or eject DLLs.
> - DLLs can be injected in scripts that have not yet been run.
> - When you restart the DataMiner Agent, the injected DLL will no longer be applied.

### DMS Mobile apps

#### Monitoring app: Alarm history now also available \[ID 25002\]

In the Monitoring app, alarm history is now also available.

#### Web applications updated to Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 \[ID 25422\]

Web applications (Web Services API, legacy dashboards, Maps, etc.) have been updated to Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2.

### DMS Service & Resource Management

#### Exporting and importing profile parameters \[ID 24641\]

It is now possible to export and import profile parameters to and from a file.

The following methods have been added to the ProfileManagerHelper:

- `export(IEnumerable<Guid> ids)`

  This method returns an object of type “ProfileParameterExportResult”, which contains the bytes of the export file. These bytes can then be saved to a file. To view the contents of that file, first unzip it.

  When you export profile parameters to a file, the following exceptions can be thrown:

  | Exception | Description |
  |--|--|
  | ProfileParameterNotFoundException | The ID of one of the profile parameters that was passed to the method could not be found. |
  | MediationSnippetNotFoundException | One of the profile parameters that was passed to the method has a link to a mediation snippet that could not be found. |

- `import(byte[] file)`

  This method returns an object of type “ProfileParameterImportResult”, which contains the imported profile parameters and mediation snippets.

  When you import profile parameters from a file, the following exceptions can be thrown:

  | Exception                        | Description                                                                    |
  |----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | InvalidDataException             | The file to be imported does not have the correct format.                      |
  | InvalidProfileParameterException | One of the profile parameters to be imported does not have the correct format. |
  | InvalidMediationSnippetException | One of the mediation snippets to be imported does not have the correct format. |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If you export a profile parameter, all the mediation snippets linked to that parameter will also be exported.
> - When you import profile parameters and their mediation snippets, all existing profile parameters and mediation snippets with the same ID will be overwritten.

#### Tracking the history of ReservationInstances \[ID 25006\]

All changes made to ReservationInstances will now be logged by means of HistoryChange records, stored in Indexing Engine (index “chistory-reservationinstance”).

A HistoryChange records contains the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|--|--|
| ID | ID of the HistoryChange record. |
| SubjectId | ID of the ReservationInstance that was changed. |
| Time | Time at which the change was made. |
| FullUsername | Full user name of the person who made the change. If the change was triggered by the DataMiner System, this will be “DataMiner”. |
| DmaId | ID of the DataMiner Agent on which the change was triggered. |
| Changes | List of changes that were made. In case of a ReservationInstance, this can be a resource usage change or a status change. |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If, for some reason, tracking changes to ReservationInstances would fail, an error will be logged in SLHistoryManager.txt each time a HistoryChange record could not be saved. To prevent users from receiving too many notices, a notice will only be generated every hour.
> - When a backup is configured to include the Service & Resource Management module, this will also include the chistory-reservationinstance table.
> - When a ReservationInstance is deleted, all HistoryChange records associated with this ReservationInstance will also be deleted, and a new HistoryChange record will be added to indicate when the ReservationInstance was deleted and by whom.

#### Linking an ID of a contributing resource to a ServiceReservationInstance \[ID 25186\]

It is now possible to link an ID of a contributing resource to a ServiceReservationInstance.

When checking whether a boolean ReservationInstance property is set to true or false, you can now specify the type as “Bool” as well as “Boolean”. See the following example:

```csharp
"ReservationInstance.Properties.\"Contributing Service\"[Bool]==false"
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Do not enclose the values true and false in single quotes. This would cause those values to be interpreted as string values instead of boolean values.
> - Do not enclose the filter in round brackets (...).

#### Dashboards app - Line chart component: Timestamp will now always remain visible in the legend \[ID 25421\]

When hovering over trend graph values in a line chart component, the associated timestamp will now always remain visible in the legend.

When the legend is collapsed, instead of not showing any timestamp, it will now show the timestamp above the trend values. When the legend is expanded, it will show the timestamp as it did before.

#### DataMiner Cube: User name box on login screen can now display user names with a length of up to 64 characters \[ID 25426\]

#### When a function resource was deleted, its row in the \[Generic DVE Linker Table\] would incorrectly not be removed \[ID 25356\]

When a function resource is created, a row is added to both the \[Generic DVE Table\] and the \[Generic DVE Linker table\]. When a function resource was deleted, in some cases, only the row in the \[Generic DVE Table\] was deleted. The row in the \[Generic DVE Linker table\] would incorrectly not get deleted.

#### Problem with interface properties of DVE elements \[ID 25360\]

When, in the DataMiner Connectivity Framework page of the General Parameters of an element, the \[Interface Properties\] table was updated, in some cases, some of the information in that table would not get synchronized correctly to the interfaces of the Virtual Function elements when linking them.

#### DataMiner Cube - Trending: Problem when export a trend graph to a CSV file \[ID 25369\]

When you exported a trend graph to a CSV file, in some cases, that CSV file would be formatted incorrectly, especially when the exported graph contained multiple lines.

#### Invalid alarm levels were passed to the parent items when bubble-up severity was identical to that of the table row and one of them got cleared \[ID 25383\]

When the bubble-up severity was identical to that of the table row itself, and one of those was cleared, in some cases, an invalid alarm level would be passed to the parent items.

#### Web Services API v0: GetActiveAlarmsFromView SOAP call would return alarms from parameters not included in the services found in the specified view \[ID 25391\]
