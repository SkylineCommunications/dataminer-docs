### Enhancements

#### DataMiner Cube: New label indicating new trend group that is being added \[ID 19526\]

When a new trend group is being added in DataMiner Cube, a "\[new\]" label will be added to the trend group name in the pane that lists the existing trend groups, just as this is done for scripts in the Automation app, for example.

#### Services app - Services tab: Enhanced list view column configuration \[ID 23785\]

When you right-click a column in the *Services* tab and click *Add/remove column*, you can also select *More* to open the *Choose details* window. In that window, the way in which to set a column’s type (which, by default, is set to “Text”) has now been enhanced.

To set the type of a column, open the *Column type* selection box, and

- select “Alarm icon” to display the IDs in the column as alarm icons,
- select “Custom icon” to have the column contents replaced by icons,
- select “Color” to have the cells of that column visualized as colored blocks, or
- select “Date” to have the column contents displayed as date values.

A number of performance enhancements have been made to the Dashboards app, especially with regard to the use of button panels.

The maxJSONLength setting, for instance, has now been made configurable. Up to now, this setting, which is used when serializing and deserializing WebSocket messages, was always set to 4MiB.

To set maxJSONLength to a specific value, do the following:

1. Open the *Web.config* file located in the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Webpages\API` folder.

1. Make sure that the *configuration.appSettings* section contains an element similar to the following one:

    ```xml
    <add key="maxJsonLength" value="?10485760?" />
    ```

    Note that the value should be specified in bytes. In the example above, maxJSONLength was set to 10 MiB.

> [!NOTE]
> If no maxJSONLength value is specified in the Web.config file, this setting will be set to 20 MiB by default.

- When *ProtocolFunctionVersion.ToXml* is called, the resulting XML will now wrap the contents of the "Graphical" tag in a CData tag.

#### Dashboards app - Group component: Option to have the legend be expanded or collapsed by default \[ID 24046\]

The Group component now has an option that allows you to specify whether its legend should by default be expanded or collapsed.

If you do not set this option, the legend will by default be collapsed.

#### Cassandra service: Restart time-out increased from 10 seconds to 5 minutes \[ID 24084\]

When the Cassandra service goes down, DataMiner automatically attempts to restart the service.

The time-out for the Cassandra service to change from “starting” to “started” has now been increased from 10 seconds to 5 minutes. Also, if a restart attempt fails or times out after 5 minutes, DataMiner will now keep trying indefinitely every 60 seconds.

Logging has also been improved. Each time a restart attempt has failed, an error will now be added to the log.

#### Cassandra service: Startup time-out increased from 10 seconds to 5 minutes \[ID 24088\]

When the Cassandra service is down while DataMiner is starting up, DataMiner will automatically attempt to start the service.

- If DataMiner is not able to start the Cassandra service in 5 minutes, it will start up in file offload mode with all elements in an error state.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Starting the Cassandra service by hand requires a full DataMiner restart.

- If DataMiner is able to start the Cassandra service, but not to establish a database connection, DataMiner will try to establish a connection for the number of times specified in the following Db.xml setting:

    ```xml
    <DataBase active="true" local="true" type="Cassandra">
      <ConnectionRetries>60</ConnectionRetries>
    </DataBase>

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Problem when sorting alarms after grouping them \[ID 23845\]

When, in the hamburger menu of the Alarm Console, the *Automatically group according to arrangement* option is disabled, you can group the alarms by right-clicking a column header and selecting *Group by this field*. You can then sort the alarms in the different groups by clicking a column header. In some cases, however, after grouping alarms by a particular column, it was no longer possible to sort alarms by that same column.

#### Table cells could no longer be set to 'invalid' & problem with SLElement when a user subscribed to a view table \[ID 23997\]

Due to a validation check problem, table cells could no longer be set to “invalid”.

Also, in some cases, an error could occur in SLElement when a user subscribed to a view table.

#### Parameters exported to multiple types of DVE elements would not be updated in all DVE elements \[ID 24103\]

When a parameter that was not directly linked to a DVE element via primary or foreign key was exported to multiple types of DVE elements sharing the same parent DVE element, it could occur that updates of that parameter did not get pushed to all the DVE elements to which it had been exported.

#### DataMiner Cube: Updates made to the LDAP settings would not immediately be applied \[ID 24110\]

When changes had been made to the LDAP settings, in some cases, those changes would not be applied immediately. From now on, any change made to the LDAP settings will be applied immediately.

#### Cassandra migration: Incorrect estimation of the amount of data to be migrated \[ID 24117\]

To be able to indicate the progress of a data migration operation, DataMiner first has to make an estimation of the amount of data to be migrated. Up to now, due to an incorrect calculation of logger table sizes, this estimation was not correct.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: DCF connection lines between dynamically positioned shapes would disappear after zooming in and out \[ID 24119\]

In some cases, DCF connection lines between dynamically positioned shapes would disappear after zooming in and out.

#### Dashboards app: Problem when a parameter state component was linked to an element feed \[ID 24136\]

When the element filter of a parameter state component was changed, in some cases, that change would not get applied. When a parameter state component was linked to an element feed, only the initial filter would be applied. Any changed to the element feed would not be passed to the parameter state component.

#### Problem when changing a foreign key value in a table linked to a DVE element or a Virtual Function \[ID 24141\]

#### Stopping an element with virtual functions included in an enhanced service would not correctly clear the alarms in the active alarms table \[ID 24154\]

When an element with virtual functions included in an enhanced service was stopped, although the alarms would disappear from the Alarm Console they would not be correctly cleared in the active alarms table of the enhanced service.

#### Performance issues in case of several subscriptions on single connection \[ID 24156\]

If several subscriptions were made on a single connection, there could be performance issues in Cube. This could for example be the case when service definitions were loaded.

#### DataMiner Cube - System Center: A backup including the Indexing database could incorrectly be started without specifying a backup path \[ID 24217\]

In the *Backup* section of *System Center*, users would incorrectly be able to start a backup that included the Indexing database even when no *Indexing Engine backup path* had been specified. As a result, the backup operation would fail immediately.

From now on, the *Execute backup* button will be disabled when no *Indexing Engine backup path* is specified.

#### DataMiner Cube - System Center: Agent list would incorrectly be expanded after having chosen not to upgrade a number of specific agents \[ID 24223\]

When, in the *Agents* section of *System Center*, you click *Upgrade*, you can choose whether to upgrade either all agents in the cluster or a number of specific agents.
