### Enhancements

#### Smart baselines: Information event generation at 5-minute intervals has been disabled [ID_36691]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

When smart baselines were configured, by default information events would be generated every 5 minutes. This information event generation has now been disabled to avoid information event floods in e.g. EPM environments.

#### DataMiner upgrade: Presence of Visual C++ 2010 redistributable will no longer be checked [ID_36745]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

During a DataMiner upgrade, from now on, the presence of the Visual C++ 2010 redistributable will no longer be checked.

### Fixes

#### SNMPv3 credentials would not get deleted when an SNMPv3 element was deleted [ID_36573]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When an SNMPv3 element was deleted, its SNMPv3 credentials would incorrectly not get deleted. Also, when users were deleted, their DCP credentials would not get deleted.

#### Dashboards app: Black boxes on top of first or last field of selection boxes on small screens [ID_36738]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When you reduced the screen size to the point at which the navigation pane got hidden, a black box would incorrectly appear on top of the first or last field of a selection box.
