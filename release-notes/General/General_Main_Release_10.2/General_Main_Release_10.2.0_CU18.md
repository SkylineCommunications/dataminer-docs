### Enhancements

#### NATS: Enhanced (re)configuration [ID_35246]

Automatic NATS (re)configuration has been enhanced.

- When the routes of the local NATS server contain the virtual IP address of a Failover setup/node, a NATS restart will be triggered.

- When a DataMiner Agent is added or removed from the DMS, NATS will be reconfigured automatically.

- When a DataMiner Agent cannot be reached, has an incorrect configuration or is in an incorrect state, a NATS reconfiguration will be suggested in Cube via an alarm. To trigger a reconfiguration, users with *Change IP settings* permission can then right-click the alarm, select *Actions > Reconfigure NATS*, and confirm the operation.

  If no errors occur during the reconfiguration, the alarm will disappear from the Alarm Console. If, on the other hand, errors do occur, they will be displayed in a popup window and the alarm will not disappear.

All logging related to a NATS reconfiguration will be added to the *SLNATSCustodian.txt* log file.

#### DataMiner upgrade: New upgrade action added that will clean up default ListView column configuration data [ID_36475]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

During a DataMiner upgrade, from now on, all default ListView column configuration data left on the server will automatically be cleaned up if no more than one Cube client has taken a copy of that data.

#### SLLogCollector will now also collect the scheduled tasks configured in Microsoft Task Scheduler [ID_36645]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

SLLogCollector will now also collect the scheduled tasks configured in Microsoft Task Scheduler.

#### Smart baselines: Information event generation at 5-minute intervals has been disabled [ID_36691]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

When smart baselines were configured, by default information events would be generated every 5 minutes. This information event generation has now been disabled to avoid information event floods in e.g. EPM environments.

#### DataMiner upgrade: Presence of Visual C++ 2010 redistributable will no longer be checked [ID_36745]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

During a DataMiner upgrade, from now on, the presence of the Visual C++ 2010 redistributable will no longer be checked.

#### DataMiner Cube - Resources: Enhanced logging when function resources failed to initialize [ID_36763]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

A more detailed entry will now be added to the Cube logging when a function resource failed to initialize.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Warning message will now appear when you embed a visual overview assigned to a view in that same visual overview [ID_36791]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

Up to now, embedding a visual overview assigned to a view in that same visual overview could cause an infinite loop, leading to the Cube client becoming unresponsive. From now on, when Cube detects that a visual overview assigned to a view in that same visual overview has been embedded, a warning message will be displayed.

#### SLWatchdog: Additional logging & retry mechanism for restarts [ID_36839]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When SLWatchdog starts, restarts or stops DataMiner, extra information will now be logged to help pinpoint certain issues that may arise:

- the SLDataMiner process ID,
- the output of the batch scripts that are being executed while DataMiner is (re)starting,
- etc.

Also, if DataMiner did not start up correctly for some reason, a retry will now be attempted in that same startup routine.

In the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Tools` folder, you can also find the following new startup scripts:

- *DataMiner Start DataMiner And SLNet.bat*
- *DataMiner Start DataMiner.bat*

#### NATS firewall rule profiles set to 'All" during DataMiner upgrades [ID_36914]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

During a DataMiner upgrade, from now on, the *InstallNATS* upgrade action will set all existing NATS firewall rule profiles to "All".

#### SLLogCollector: Easier selection of processes after selecting 'Include memory dump' [ID_36982]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When configuring the *SLLogCollector* tool, you can select the *Include memory dump* option, and then indicate for which process(es) memory dumps should be collected and when these should be collected. Up to now, to select a process, you had to select a checkbox. From now on, you will be able to select a process by clicking any cell in the row representing the process.

#### Visual Overview: Warning message when embedding visual overview assigned to element in that same visual overview [ID_37078]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

Up to now, embedding a visual overview assigned to an element in that same visual overview could cause an infinite loop, leading to the Cube client becoming unresponsive. From now on, when Cube detects that a visual overview assigned to an element in that same visual overview has been embedded, a warning message will be displayed.

#### Visual Overview: Warning message when embedding visual overview assigned to service in that same visual overview [ID_37082]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

Up to now, embedding a visual overview assigned to a service in that same visual overview could cause an infinite loop, leading to the Cube client becoming unresponsive. From now on, when Cube detects that a visual overview assigned to a service in that same visual overview has been embedded, a warning message will be displayed.

### Fixes

#### Problem due to incorrect NATS reconfiguration [ID_35246]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When, for example in a three-node DMS configuration composed of a Failover pair and another, separate DMA, one of the agents in the Failover setup went offline, after 5 minutes, the separate non-Failover agent would incorrectly shift to a two-node DMS configuration. From now on, the non-Failover agent will keep the three-node DMS configuration if one of the Failover agents goes offline.

#### Problem when an SNMP connection was assigned to a separate thread [ID_36441]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When, in a protocol, an SNMP connection was assigned to a separate thread, in most cases, the polling would get stuck because the main protocol thread would get notified of the response rather than the thread that was assigned to the SNMP connection.

From now on, a poll group will default to connection 0 rather than -1. As a result, when a separate thread is created for the main connection (i.e. the connection with ID 0), the groups for that connection will no longer need to have `connection="0"` specified.

Also, the following issues have been fixed:

- Potential memory leaks and SLProtocol errors related to SNMP and additional protocol threads. For example, up to now, stopping an element while a forced group was being executed could cause an error to occur in SLProtocol.

- Up to now, assigning the same connection ID to multiple thread elements could result in undefined behavior. From now on, connection IDs will be assigned according to what occurs first.

> [!NOTE]
> Known issue: Currently, the action to stop the current group is only capable of stopping the group on the main thread. It is not yet possible to specify a particular thread on which to stop a group.

#### Failover: Problems when running BPA tests [ID_36445]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When the backup agent was active, certain BPA tests would incorrectly return the following error:

`This BPA does not apply for this Agent: cannot run on Offline Failover Agents`

Also, certain managers in SLNet (e.g. BPA Manager) would not properly initialize if the following Failover settings were configured in the *SLDMS.xml* file:

- `State="Offline"`
- `StateBeforeShutDown="Online"`

#### SNMPv3 credentials would not get deleted when an SNMPv3 element was deleted [ID_36573]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When an SNMPv3 element was deleted, its SNMPv3 credentials would incorrectly not get deleted. Also, when users were deleted, their DCP credentials would not get deleted.

#### DataMiner Cube: Report or dashboard would not be selected after 'Email', 'Upload to FTP' or 'Upload to shared folder' action was initialized [ID_36631]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

In *Automation*, *Correlation* and *Scheduler*, you can select a report of a dashboard in an *Email*, *Upload to FTP* or *Upload to shared folder* action. When such an action was initialized, in some rare cases, the report or dashboard would not be automatically selected.

#### Monitoring app: Problem when receiving parameter table updates via polling [ID_36660]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.8 -->

When, in the *Monitoring* app, a parameter table received updates via polling, the table would display `There is no data to display`.

#### Dashboards app: Black boxes on top of first or last field of selection boxes on small screens [ID_36738]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When you reduced the screen size to the point at which the navigation pane got hidden, a black box would incorrectly appear on top of the first or last field of a selection box.

#### NT Notify type NT_ADD_VIEW could be executed with an invalid parent view ID [ID_36739]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

Up to now, when an `NT_ADD_VIEW` call was executed with `parentViewID` set to a non-existing view ID, the newly added view would not be visible in the Surveyor. Hence, there was no way of correcting the situation using the UI. Cube logging would include a warning that a `parentViewID` cannot be resolved.

Validation has now been added to `NT_ADD_VIEW`. When a request enters to create a view with an invalid parent view ID, the view will not be created. Also, views with an invalid parent view ID will now be placed directly under the root view. This will allow you to drag the view to its correct location, updating its parent view ID to a valid ID in the process. An error will also be logged and the *View Recursion* BPA test will report the view in question.

#### Low-Code Apps: Creating an app with an existing name would incorrectly be possible [ID_36744]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

Up to now, it would incorrectly be possible to create a low-code app with a name that was identical to that of an existing app.

From now on, when you try to create an app with a name that is identical to that of an existing app, an error will be thrown.

#### Dashboards app: 'UpdateDashboard' call was sent twice when deleting a component [ID_36766]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When you deleted a component from a dashboard, an `UpdateDashboard` call would incorrectly be sent twice.

#### DataMiner Cube - Trending: Panning across the graph would not work [ID_36769]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When you opened a trend graph showing trend data of a parameter that only had average trending enabled, in some cases, it would not be possible to pan across the graph.

#### Dashboards app: Problem when clicking 'Start with a blank dashboard' [ID_36798]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When you clicked *Start with a blank dashboard* twice in rapid succession, two pop-up windows would open.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Problem with [this EnhancedServiceID] placeholder [ID_36808]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

In some cases, the *[this EnhancedServiceID]* placeholder would not resolve correctly when used inside another placeholder.

For example, when you had specified `[param: [this EnhancedServiceID], 1]`, the parameter of the service element with parameter ID 1 would not be displayed correctly in the shape text.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: User menu would not close when clicking the user icon [ID_36829]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When you had opened the user menu by clicking the user icon in the top-right corner, that menu would not close when you clicked the user icon a second time.

#### Problem with SLScripting when resolving assemblies [ID_36843]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

In some cases, an error could occur in SLScripting when it was resolving DLL files for a QAction or an Automation Script.

#### Problem with SLProtocol when the system locale was set to Japanese [ID_36854]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

On the system locale was set to Japanese, an error could occur in SLProtocol when a QAction tried to read a parameter value containing raw bytes.

#### Cassandra Cluster: Not all data would get offloaded when the database went down [ID_36865]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When a Cassandra Cluster database went down, not all data would get offloaded.

#### Polling an SNMP table with MultipleGetNext could incorrectly produce two result sets [ID_36867]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When an SNMP table was polled with *MultipleGetNext* and the response was not processed within 10 minutes, in some rare cases, an error could occur in SLSNMPManager, causing the table to be polled a second time as the result of a retry. This meant that, in such a case, one poll action would produce two result sets.

#### Elements would not be created on remote agents when importing elements from a CSV file [ID_36873]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When you imported elements from a CSV file, new elements would only be created on the local agent, not on any of the remote agents, i.e. the agents other than the one the Cube client was connected to. Existing elements would be updated correctly on the local agents as well as on all remote agents.

#### DataMiner Cube - Element cards: DataMiner Connectivity Framework tables did incorrectly not have a filter box [ID_36920]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When, on the *General parameters* page of an element card, you click *Configure* next to *DataMiner Connectivity Framework*, a window with four tables is displayed. Up to now, these tables would incorrectly no longer have a filter box. From now on, they will all have a filter box again.

#### Elements would no longer be able to generate alarms and information events after having been migrated [ID_36951]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When an element had been migrated from one DataMiner Agent to another, it would no longer be able to generate alarms and information events.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The element protocol must pass the DataMiner ID of the element instead of the DataMiner ID of the DataMiner Agent.

#### Dashboards app: Problem when generating a PDF file with a custom paper size [ID_36968]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When a PDF file with a custom paper size was generated, the following error would be thrown:

`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'width')'.`

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: Problem when exporting a table with a query row feed to a CSV file [ID_36969]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

Up to now, an error would be thrown when you tried to export a table with a query row feed to a CSV file.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: Form component would not be cleared when it was no longer fed a DOM instance or a DOM definition [ID_37001]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

The *Form* component would not be cleared when it was no longer fed a DOM instance or a DOM definition.

#### Dashboards app: 'Loading...' indicator would appear when trying to save a nameless folder [ID_37002]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When, in the *Create folder* or *Create dashboard* window, you clicked inside the *Location* box, clicked "+" to add a new folder, entered a folder name, cleared that same folder name, and then clicked the checkmark button, a "Loading..." indicator would appear at the top of the window but nothing would happen.

#### Monitoring app: Problem when no view properties were shown in the Surveyor [ID_37010]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When you opened the *Monitoring* app, an error could occur when no view properties were shown in the Surveyor.

#### Dynamic IP setting for a serial connection would cause incorrect SSH errors to be logged [ID_37016]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When, for a particular parameter, the `options` attribute of the `<Type>` element was set to "dynamic ip" for a serial connection, the following incorrect entry would be added to the element's log file:

`An error occurred when applying SSH connection settings from parameters. Not implemented (hr = 0x80004001)`

Moreover, when additional logging was activated for SLPort, an `Attempted to set SSH options on a non-SSH connection` error would be added to the same log file, followed by an unreadable value (representing the IP address), which could even cause a fatal error to occur in SLPort.

#### Problem with SLElement when updating the alarm template of an element [ID_37027]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18] - FR TBD -->

When the alarm template of an element was updated, a run-time error could occur in the SLElement process.

#### Monitoring app & Dashboards app: Cleared alarm groups would incorrectly still appear in alarm lists [ID_37045]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When you opened the Alarm Console in the *Monitoring* app or an alarm list in the *Dashboards* app, alarm groups that had already been cleared would incorrectly still appear in the list.

#### Problems when selecting report in Automation or Scheduler module [ID_37052]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

In the Automation or Scheduler module, when you selected a report for the email, FTP, or shared folder action, the following issues could occur:

- In some cases, the "required info" label was not shown.
- When you switched from a different action to the email, FTP, or shared folder action, it could occur that the list of selectable reports and dashboards was not loaded in the dropdown boxes.
