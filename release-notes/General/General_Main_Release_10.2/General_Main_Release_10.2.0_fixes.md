#### Dashboards app - Time range feed: Value passed along incorrectly when 'Use quick picks' option was selected \[ID 29471\]

When the “Use quick picks” option was selected, a time range feed would pass along the selected value incorrectly.

Also, custom quick picks would disappear when reloading the dashboard, and when the “Allow refresh” option was selected, the feed would not correctly update the linked trend graph when the refresh counter was reset.

#### Dashboards app - GQI: Inconsistent column order when 'select' or 'get parameters' nodes were linked to a feed \[ID 29479\]

When the “Select” or “Get parameters for element where” nodes of a query were linked to a feed, in some cases, the order of the selected parameter columns would not be consistent with the feed selection.

From now on, the default columns will always come first, followed by the items supplied by the feed.

#### Serial communication: Problem when multiple potential responses were defined in a serial pair \[ID 29496\]

When multiple possible responses were defined in a serial pair, the responses after the first response potentially would not match the received data when header and trailer parameters were not identical.

In the following example, a pair has three responses defined (100, 101, and 102), of which one is expected to match the received data. When the headers and trailers of responses 101 and 102 were identical to those of response 100, the data was matched as expected. However, when the header or trailer was not identical, then a match could be missed for response 101 and 102.

```xml
<Pair id="100">
  <Name>Pair 100</Name>
  <Content>
    <Command>100</Command>
    <Response>100</Response>

#### DataMiner Cube - Trending: Problem when exporting average trend data of a trend graph with multiple lines \[ID 29579\]

When you tried to export the average trend data of a trend graph with multiple lines, in some cases, the export operation would fail. The “retrieving data” notice would not disappear and the export file would not get created.

#### Dashboards app - GQI: Filters unnecessarily sent along with SLNet calls \[ID 29583\]

When a GQI query contains a filter to be applied to e.g. a parameter table, then that filter will be sent along with the SLNet call to allow SLElement to apply the filter for performance reasons. However, in some cases, a filter would also be sent along with the SLNet call when this was not applicable (e.g. when there was a join or aggregation operation between the filter and the data source).

#### Elasticsearch: Problem with postfilters \[ID 29602\]

When a client requested data from an Elasticsearch database with a filter, in some cases, an incorrect result set would be returned because the postfilter would incorrectly apply a filter in local time on a field formatted in UTC time. This issue has now been resolved. Also, from now on, postfilters will only be applied when necessary.

#### GetActiveHysteresisInfoResponseMessage contained entries for elements without alarm data \[ID 29604\]

Up to now, when a GetActiveHysteresisInfoMessage request was sent, the GetActiveHysteresisInfoResponseMessage would contain an entry for every element in the DataMiner Agent, whether it had alarm data or not. From now on, elements without active hysteresis data will be removed from the response.

> [!NOTE]
> GetActiveHysteresisInfoMessage now also contains a constructor that accepts a DataMiner ID. That way, an ID will no longer have to be provided after constructing the object.

#### SLAnalytics - Alarm focus: Alarms treated as unexpected when baseline values in alarm template were updated automatically because of use of smart baselines \[ID 29670\]

When a user makes a change to an alarm template, SLAnalytics will treat all alarms of the parameters for which a change was implemented in the alarm template as unexpected. However, in some cases, it would incorrectly act in a similar way when, in case of smart baselines, baseline values were updated automatically.

Also, in some cases, no action would be taken when, in case of smart baselines, alarm template settings of table parameters were changed.

#### Problem when deleting a service by name \[ID 29691\]

When a SetDataMinerInfoMessage was used to delete a service using the service name, in some cases, an exception could be thrown.

#### Interactive Automation scripts: Problem when entering double-digit numbers in input controls \[ID 29736\]

In some cases, because of a problem with the WantsOnChange functionality, it would not be possible to enter a double-digit number (e.g. a number of minutes) in an input control. The interactive Automation script would incorrectly already continue after you entered the first digit.

#### Problem when an interactive Automaton script was detached on closure \[ID 29815\]

Also, in some cases, columns would not resize correctly.

#### Failover: Cassandra nodes would not be removed from the Cassandra cluster when a Failover configuration was ended \[ID 29894\]

When a Failover configuration was ended, in some cases, the Cassandra nodes would not be removed from the Cassandra cluster. From now on, the Cassandra nodes on the main and the backup agent will each be properly removed from the Cassandra cluster and become single nodes.

> [!NOTE]
> After ending a Failover configuration, it is recommended to check the nodetool status on both nodes to make sure the nodes no longer form a cluster.

#### Dashboards app - GQI: Raw values displayed when grouping row after performing an aggregation \[ID 29904\]

When rows were grouped after an aggregation was performed, raw values would incorrectly be displayed instead of display values.

#### Dashboards app - GQI: Problem when applying a filter to a query that used a 'Get parameters for element where' data source \[ID 29907\]

When the DataMiner Cube desktop app was started, in some cases, the start window would not show any DataMiner Systems.

#### Resources and Services modules also loaded functions that were not active \[ID 30107\]

In the Resources and Services modules, it could occur that functions were loaded even though they were not marked as active, which could cause several functions with the same GUID to be loaded.

#### DataMiner Cube: Missing alarms in Active alarms tab \[ID 30126\]

In some rare cases, after connecting to a busy system, it could occur that alarms were missing in the Active alarms tab in the Alarm Console.

#### DataMiner Cube - EPM: Problem opening an EPM card from an alarm when the 'System Name' alarm property contained a trailing space \[ID 30169\]

When the “System Name” property of an alarm contained a trailing space, in some cases, it would not be possible to open the EPM card from the alarm in question.

#### SLAnalytics: Problem when the connection with SLNet was lost \[ID 30238\]

In some rare cases, an error could occur in SLAnalytics when the connection with SLNet was lost.

#### Dashboards app: 'Loading' bar stayed visible longer than necessary \[ID 30343\]

When you dragged a table parameter onto a state timeline component, up to now, the following error would be visible until you specified a table index:

```txt
Failed getting the timeline data from the DMA agent: Empty server response
```

This error will now be replaced by a message that clearly indicates that the table index is still missing and should be specified.

#### Dashboards app: Query with filter on value discrete parameter not working correctly \[ID 30486\]

If a query in a dashboard was filtered on the value of a discrete parameter, it could occur that the filter was not executed correctly. This happened because the filter used the display value of the parameter instead of the actual value.

#### Dashboards app - Tree feed & Parameter feed: Problem with 'Selected only' option \[ID 30510\]

When you open a dashboard containing a tree feed or a parameter feed with a preset selection in the URL, the “Selected only” option of those feeds is selected by default.

Up to now, when you cleared that option in one of those feeds and then selected other items in the feed, the “Selected only” option would incorrectly be selected again.

#### Profile parameter with mediation snippet incorrectly shown as changed \[ID 30530\]

When a profile parameter with a mediation snippet was loaded initially, it would incorrectly be shown as having unsaved changes.

#### Dashboards app - Parameter feed: Indices of selected items not all selected \[ID 30532\]

When you opened a dashboard containing a parameter feed with a preset selection, in some cases, the indices of the selected items would not all be selected.

#### Profiles module: Discrete capability parameter showed actual values instead of display values \[ID 30533\]

In the Profiles module, if a capability parameter of type Discrete was configured in a profile instance, the drop-down box for this parameter showed the actual discrete values instead of the display values.

#### Insufficient information in exception message in case of invalid characters in dictionary keys \[ID 30602\]

When an exception was thrown because invalid characters were used in dictionary keys, it could occur that the message did not include all invalid characters, but only the string array type name.

#### Automation: Problems with datetime filters in scripts \[ID 30611\]

Several issues have been resolved in case data is retrieved using a datetime filter in a script:

- DataMiner will now translate between UTC and local time when necessary. Previously, data objects could be in UTC time while the filter used local time.
- If *DateTime.Kind* is unspecified, now no action is performed.

#### Problem with SLNet because of unhandled exception \[ID 30626\]

In some rare cases, an unhandled exception could cause a problem in the SLNet process.

#### Service & Resource Management: Property updates overwritten by status updates \[ID 30642\]

When the properties of a ReservationInstance were updated in an asynchronous event script while the end actions were running, in some cases, the end actions could overwrite the updated properties, causing the event script’s property update to fail and throw a “PropertiesAlreadyModified” exception.

#### DataMiner Cube - Resources app: Not possible to link virtual function resources to elements of which the protocol version was set to 'production' \[ID 30655\]

In the Resources app, it is possible to create virtual function resources that are linked to compatible elements. Up to now, in some cases, it was not possible to link virtual function resources to elements of which the protocol version was set to “production”.

#### Visual Overview: Property value not shown in shape text \[ID 30696\]

If an element shape was configured with property shape data and contained "\*" as its shape text, it could occur that the property value was not shown even though it was available.

#### Dashboards app: All pages of query initially loaded in table component \[ID 30697\]

If a table component showed a query with multiple pages of data, it could occur that all pages were initially fetched instead of only the first page.

#### Dashboards app: State component showed GQI query ID instead of display name \[ID 30702\]

The State component incorrectly showed the ID of a GQI query instead of its display name.

Also, when you tried to import a dashboard on a DataMiner Agent that did not have an “ImportDashboards” folder, the Dashboards app would incorrectly look for the dashboard to be imported in the “Dashboards” folder instead. From now on, when the “ImportDashboards” folder does not exist, a message will appear, saying that no dashboards are available for import.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Session variable 'IDOfSelection' of ListView updated incorrectly \[ID 31395\]

When you embed a list view component in a visual overview and set the Source field to “Bookings”, then the session variable IDOfSelection will contain the ID of the currently selected booking.

#### Web apps: 'Refresh now' instead of 'Reconnecting...' message after communication was interrupted \[ID 31753\]

Up now on, when a web app (e.g. Dashboards, Monitoring, Ticketing, etc.) lost communication, a “Reconnecting...” message would appear in the UI. From now on, a “Refresh now” message will appear instead, prompting users to refresh the web page.

#### Failover: DataMiner modules would incorrectly consider the local IP address of the online agent as the primary IP address of the Failover setup \[ID 31756\]

After a Failover configuration had been updated (either manually or after an automatic synchronization), the DataMiner modules would incorrectly consider the local IP address of the online agent as the primary IP address of the Failover setup (instead of the virtual IP address). As a result, when file changes on the Failover setup were forwarded to other agents in the DMS, those agents would reject the changes as the IP address of the sender was unknown to them. Only after a DMA restart or a switchover/switchback operation would the DataMiner modules again use the virtual IP address of the Failover setup.

#### Jobs app: Hidden or required fields no longer hidden or required when domain or section was duplicated \[ID 31758\]

#### DataMiner would incorrectly try to connect to 127.0.0.1 when taking a backup of a Cassandra database \[ID 32242\]

When a DataMiner backup included a backup of a Cassandra database, and, in the Cassandra.yml file, the rpc_address setting did not contain “0.0.0.0”, DataMiner would incorrectly assume the database was located at IP address 127.0.0.1. From now on, DataMiner will instead connect to the database located at the IP address specified in the DB.xml file.

#### Dashboards app: Feeds would stop feeding data after refreshing the page \[ID 32251\]

In some cases, feeds in a dashboards would stop feeding data after refreshing the page.

#### Dashboards app: Parameter state component would not show parameter updates for certain column parameters when using table index filters \[ID 32268\]

When a parameter state component was linked to a column parameter from a table using display keys and filtered using a table index filter, the data displayed by that component would not be updated when changes were made to the parameter.

#### Dashboards app: GQI engine would not fall back to the timezone of the browser when the commonServer.ui.DefaultTimeZone setting could not be found \[ID 32283\]

From DataMiner 9.6.11 onwards, the DataMiner web apps format time values based on the commonServer.ui.DefaultTimeZone setting, located in the C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Users\\ClientSettings.json file. When this setting cannot be found, they will instead use the time zone of the browser. Up to now, the GQI engine would incorrectly not fall back to the time zone of the browser when it was unable to find the commonServer.ui.DefaultTimeZone setting in the ClientSettings.json file.

#### DataMiner Cube: Problem when a user without permission to view service definitions connected to an SRM system \[ID 32309\]

#### Failover: Problem with SLDataGateway after losing its connection to SLNet during a Failover switch \[ID 32435\]

When a Failover switch is performed, in some cases, SLDataGateway loses its connection to SLNet and immediately recreates it. However, because it did not receive any SLNet events during the time the connection was lost, up to now, SLDataGateway would be unaware that DataMiner was up and running, causing all write operations that require information from SLNet to get blocked. From now on, as soon as the connection between SLNet and SLDataGateway is re-established, the latter will assume DataMiner is up and running.

#### Dashboards: Component selection not cleared when switching between dashboards \[ID 32452\]

In some cases, component selection was not cleared when you switched between different dashboards in the Dashboards app, which could cause issues when new components were added.

#### SLAnalytics: Pattern matching would no longer work due to a problem while retrieving pattern data from Elasticsearch \[ID 32466\]

In some cases, pattern matching would no longer work due to a problem while retrieving pattern data from the Elasticsearch database.
