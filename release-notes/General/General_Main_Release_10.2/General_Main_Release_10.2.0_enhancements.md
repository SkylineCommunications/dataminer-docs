#### Security enhancements \[ID 29724\] \[ID 29883\] \[ID 30086\] \[ID 30087\] \[ID 30192\] \[ID 30202\] \[ID 30257\] \[ID 30345\] \[ID 30674\] \[ID 31081\] \[ID 31169\] \[ID 31307\] \[ID 32081\]

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Automatic incident tracking will now ignore parameter name changes \[ID 28075\]

From now on, automatic incident tracking will ignore parameter name changes. The name of an alarm group will now always be the name of the parameter as specified in the protocol.

This will prevent parameters with different names ending up in the same alarm group.

#### DataMiner Jobs: New field type 'ServiceDefinitionFieldDescriptor' \[ID 28086\]

A new field type “ServiceDefinitionFieldDescriptor” has been added, which will always require a GUID value referring to a service definition.

This field descriptor can also add service definitions using the ServiceDefinitionIds property (of type List\<Guid>), allowing you to filter service definitions based on service definition IDs.

This feature is intended to support the upcoming PLM app.

#### Dashboards app - Line chart component: Trend percentile calculation will now also take into account the period during which a parameter had a certain value \[ID 28135\]

From now on, trend percentile calculations will also take into account the period during which a parameter had a certain value.

> [!NOTE]
> Percentile calculation is skipped when a parameter is of type discrete or when multiple parameters are displayed in one trend graph.

```txt
Central DataBase Offload threads aren't closed in a timely fashion. Potential issues with offloading rate data can occur. Disabling and enabling offload rate settings is advised.
```

#### SLAnalytics will now keep track of configuration changes \[ID 28223\]

From now on, SLAnalytics will keep track of all changes made to its configuration settings.

Each DMA will keep a local configuration history, which will not be synchronized with the other DMAs in the DMS.

#### Dashboards app - Pivot table component: Indices from different tables in different elements with identical names will be displayed on the same row \[ID 28344\]

Up to now, when a pivot table component displayed indices on the same row, they were mapped in memory based on primary key. So, when you had indices from different tables in different elements with identical names, those indices would be displayed on different rows because, in memory, they had different primary keys.

From now on, the display keys will also be taken into account. As a result, indices from different tables in different elements with identical names will be displayed on the same row, regardless of their primary key.

> [!NOTE]
> For this to work, the pivot table should show the indices as rows and all other types as columns. Otherwise, the indices will be split up in separate levels.

#### DataMiner Cube - Service & Resource Management: Enhanced error messages \[ID 28351\]

Up to now, when you left a name empty, one of two different error messages could appear. These messages have now been consolidated into one single error message.
