### Enhancements

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps - Table component: Enhanced visibility of rows that are selected or hovered over in dark mode [ID_35993]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When a dashboard or a low-code app is in dark mode, from now on, there will be a higher color contrast between rows that are selected or hovered over and rows that are not.

#### SLLogCollector now also collects SyncInfo files [ID_35995]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

SLLogCollector packages will now also include all files found in `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Files\SyncInfo` relevant for troubleshooting.

#### DataMiner Cube - System Center: Enhancements made to Database > Offload section [ID_36037]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

In *System Center*, a few enhancements have been made to the *Database > Offload* section:

- When you set *Type* to "Database", select *Trend data* in the *Offloads* section, and set the frequency under *Enable data offload* to "permanently", the time indication (e.g "starting every day at") will no longer be shown.

- When you set *Type* to "Database" and select *Parameter value* in the *Offloads* section, from now on, you will no longer be able to set the frequency under *Enable snapshot offload* to "permanently".

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > If, before upgrading to this DataMiner version, *Parameter value* was selected and the frequency was set to "permanently", *Parameter value* will no longer be selected after upgrading. As a result, no snapshot will be offloaded until you reconfigure the snapshot offload settings.

### Fixes

#### Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool would incorrectly not migrate the state-changes table from a single-node Cassandra to a Cassandra Cluster [ID_35699]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you used the Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool to migrate a single-node Cassandra database to a Cassandra Cluster setup, up to now, the `state-changes` table would incorrectly not be migrated.

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps - GQI components: Open sessions would not be closed when a new query was triggered [ID_35824]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When a GQI component still had a session open when a new query was triggered, in some cases, the open session would incorrectly not be closed.

#### Creating or updating a function resource while its parent element was in an error state would incorrectly be allowed [ID_35963]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When you created or updated a function resource while its parent element was in an error state, up to now, the state of that parent element would not be checked correctly. As a result, adding or updating the function resource would incorrectly be allowed.

From now on, when you create or update a function resource while its parent element is in an error state, an error will be thrown.

#### DataMiner Cube - EPM: KPI histogram would incorrectly not be shown [ID_36004]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When, in a topology chain, you opened a KPI window and clicked the histogram icon, in some cases, the histogram window would be empty.

#### Spectrum analysis: Measurement points would not be set correctly [ID_36005]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

In some cases, measurement points would not be set correctly when a trace was being displayed.

#### Dashboards app & Low-code apps: Component title could be made too large [ID_36021]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

In a custom component theme, for some fonts, the font size of the title could be set to a value higher than 36px, causing the component title to be larger than its container. Also, in some cases, the font size could incorrectly be set to 0px.

From now on, font sizes will have to be set to a value between 1px and 36px.

#### Virtual functions linked to a parameter with a hysteresis timer could be assigned an incorrect alarm severity [ID_36024]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When a virtual function was linked to a parameter that had a hysteresis timer running, in some cases, that virtual function would be assigned an incorrect alarm severity.

#### SLReset.exe would not clean an Elasticsearch database when no <DB> element was specified in DB.xml [ID_36040]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When, in the *DB.xml* file, no `<DB>` element was specified for an Elasticsearch database, the factory reset tool *SLReset.exe* would not clean that database when the `cleanclustereddatabases` option had been used.

From now on, when no `<DB>` element is specified for a Elasticsearch database, *SLReset.exe* will use the default database name "dms".

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Filtered history tab would incorrectly not show information events [ID_36105]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When you added a filtered history tab that had to show active alarms, masked alarms and information events, no information events would be shown.
