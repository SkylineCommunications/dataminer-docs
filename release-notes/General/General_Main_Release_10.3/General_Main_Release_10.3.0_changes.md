## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Security enhancements [ID_31045] [ID_31054] [ID_31761] [ID_32055] [ID_32566] [ID_33069] [ID_33078] [ID_33218] [ID_33365] [ID_33583] [ID_34723]

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### Function.xml files can now contain functions without entry points and maxInstance set to 1 [ID_31480]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.1 -->

In a functions.xml file, it is now possible to define functions without entry points and maxInstance set to 1. When all criteria are met, then a function of this type will affect all tables and column parameters defined for that particular function.

> [!NOTE]
> When you defined a function without entry points and maxInstance set to 1, \[Generic Linker Table\] entries will not be taken into account. This function will still affect all table and column parameters defined for it.

#### Filtering alarms on alarm focus: Enhanced performance [ID_31484]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.2 -->

Due to a number of enhancements, especially with regard to caching, overall performance has increased when filtering alarms on alarm focus.

#### Enhanced performance when reading data from a MySQL or SQLServer database [ID_31532]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.1 -->

Due to a number of enhancements, on systems with a MySQL or SQLServer database, overall performance has increased when reading data from the database, especially when reading trend data during the migration to another type of database.

#### Enhanced performance when reading trend data from a MySQL or SQLServer database page by page [ID_31535]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.1 -->

Due to a number of enhancements, on systems with a MySQL or SQLServer database, overall performance has increased when reading trend data from the database page by page.

#### Trending: Pattern matching enhancements [ID_31668]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.2 -->

From DataMiner 10.0.7 onwards, on systems using a Cassandra and an Elasticsearch database, DataMiner Analytics can automatically recognize recurring patterns in trend data.

A number of enhancements have now been made to this pattern matching mechanism. Also, from now on, all occurrences of recognized trend data patterns will be stored in the Elasticsearch database.

#### Alarm templates: Enhanced performance when adding alarm templates with smart baselines [ID_31670]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR (REVERTED) 10.2.3 [CU0] -->

Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when adding alarm templates with smart baselines.

#### Cassandra will no longer store ArrowWindowRecords and PatternMatchOccurrenceRecords [ID_31944]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.4 -->

Cassandra databases will no longer store the following data:

- ArrowWindowRecords
- PatternMatchOccurrenceRecords

The latter will now be stored in Elasticsearch instead.

#### Behavioral anomaly detection: Change point flood notice will now be cleared sooner [ID_32013]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.3 -->

From now on, the notice created when the rate of newly detected behavioral changes reaches an upper limit will be cleared sooner. It will now be cleared when the rate has dropped under the limit again and there is no new flood situation in the following 15 minutes. Up to now, the notice would not be cleared for at least 2 hours, even when the actual flood situation had only lasted for a few seconds.

The notice will contain the following message:

```txt
Detection of behavioral anomalies temporarily disabled on DMA ...: maximum allowed rate of behavioral change points reached.
```

#### SLAnalytics - Alarm focus: Enhanced performance [ID_32270]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.3 -->

From DataMiner 10.0.0/10.0.2 onwards, the DataMiner Analytics software assigns an estimated likelihood or “alarm focus score” to each alarm, after analyzing the short-term history and current behavior of incoming alarms in real time. Due to a number of enhancements, overall performance of this alarm focus feature has increased.

#### Analytics: Prefetching mechanism for trend icons [ID_32300]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.4
Reverted in 10.2.4 -->

During the first few minutes that DataMiner Analytics is running, it is still calculating which trend icons should be displayed. Previously, during this initial period, the trend icons to be displayed were retrieved from the Cassandra database. However, because of changes to the database, this is no longer possible. For this reason, a prefetching mechanism has now been implemented, so that when a trend icon is requested, it is calculated based on prefetched trend data. As there are safeguards in place to ensure that not too many database requests are done at the same time, this does mean that not all trend icons may be displayed immediately.

#### SLAnalytics: A notice event will no longer be generated when entering change point flood mode [ID_32402]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.3 -->

Up to now, a notice event would be generated whenever SLAnalytics had entered change point flood mode. From now on, this event will no longer be generated.

> [!NOTE]
> As before, an entry will be added to the SLAnalytics log whenever behavioral anomaly detection has temporarily been disabled because change point flood mode was activated.

#### SLAnalytics: Enhanced accuracy of proactive cap detection [ID_32591]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.8 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, proactive cap detection accuracy has been increased.

#### SLMessageBroker: Default connection timeout is now 10 minutes [ID_32884]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.5 -->

The Connect() and Publish() methods of SLMessageBroker now have a default connection timeout of 10 minutes.

Also, the interval at which another reconnect is attempted has been increased from 1 second to 10 seconds.

#### Enhancements with regard to Automation scripts [ID_33129] [ID_33226]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.6 -->

A number of enhancements have been made with regard to Automation scripts.

- When a script is launched, from now on, only the parameters/dummies with missing values will be shown. Automatically filled in values will no longer be shown.
- When script input is filled in with feed data, users will no longer be asked to change that input manually.
- Script input (parameters/dummies) linked to a feed is now filled in at the moment a script action is triggered. Subsequent changes in the feed will have no effect.
- In the DataMiner Low-Code Apps, the option to mark specific script parameters and dummies as required has been removed.
- When, in the Dashboards app, users mark a script parameter as required, they no longer need to fill in a value.
- From now on, a page load event will only trigger after the application page has been fully initialized. This will ensure that, when launching script actions with input linked to feeds, those feeds have been initialized.

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced logging [ID_33183]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.6 -->

Up to now, when the SRM log files were set to “No logging”, no information would be logged if e.g. a Reservation event had failed. All ResourceManager, ResourceManagerAutomation and FunctionManager logging has now been re-evaluated, and the log settings have been optimized. All critical issues occurring in those modules will now be logged.

#### Profile instance list for PA service definition node now also contains child instances [ID_33187]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.6
See also: DMS Cube - Fix was moved to 10.2.0 CU3 by RN 33188 -->

When you configure a service definition node in the Services app, a list of profile instances is shown for the selected profile definition. For service definitions of type "Skyline Process Automation" and "Custom Process Automation", this list will now also contain instances for child definitions of the configured profile definition.

#### Anomaly detection: Enhanced performance when generating suggestion events and alarms [ID_33283]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.6 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when generating anomaly detection suggestion events and alarms.

#### DataMiner upgrade will not be performed if NATS is not installed and running [ID_33304]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.7 -->

When you launch a DataMiner upgrade, from now on, the upgrade process will not be allowed to start if NATS is not installed and running.

> [!NOTE]
> This check will be skipped if the current DataMiner version is older than version 10.1.0.

#### SLDMS will now use less memory when storing service information [ID_33318]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, the SLDMS process will now use less memory when storing service information.

#### QADeviceSimulator: Enhanced CPU usage when running SNMPv3 simulations [ID_33376]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall CPU usage of the QADeviceSimulator has improved when running SNMPv3 simulations.

#### Service & Resource Management: Function resources will no longer be deleted when their parent DVE element cannot be reached [ID_33415] [ID_33668]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.7 -->

From now on, the deletion of a function resource will be blocked when the deletion of its parent DVE element fails.

The ResourceManagerHelper now contains a new method to delete resources:

`public Resource[] RemoveResources(Resource[] resources, ResourceDeleteOptions options)`

> [!NOTE]
> Contributing resources can be deleted even when no parent element can be found. The parent element of a contributing resource is an enhanced service element. When the contributing booking is no longer running, the enhanced service element will no longer exist.

#### SLAnalytics: Enhanced performance when retrieving parameter information [ID_33458]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when retrieving parameter information.

#### Web apps: Enhancements with regard to the rendering of GQI tables [ID_33463]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.7 -->

A number of enhancements have been made with regard to the rendering of GQI tables.

#### Alarm templates: All behavioral change points will now be considered anomalous [ID_33476]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.7 -->

From DataMiner 10.0.3 onwards, you can enable alarm monitoring on specific types of anomalies for parameters in an alarm template. Up to now, when you enabled this, an alarm was generated whenever the SLAnalytics engine considered a behavioral change point anomalous. From now on, all behavior change points will be considered anomalous and will hence trigger an alarm.

#### QADeviceSimulator: Enhanced performance when loading a MySQL database at the start of a MySQL database simulation [ID_33555]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance of the QADeviceSimulator has improved when loading a MySQL database at the start of a MySQL database simulation.

Also, the overall memory footprint of MySQL database simulations has been reduced.

#### Service & Resource Management: A booking will now be set to 'interrupted' when whatever event related to that booking could not be executed [ID_33576]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.8 -->

Up to now, when DataMiner was unavailable when a booking was supposed to start or stop, its state was set to “interrupted” when DataMiner started up again.

This functionality has now been extended. A booking will now also be set to “interrupted” when whatever event related to that booking could not be executed.

#### Frequency of smart baseline calculations is now configurable [ID_33584]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.7 -->

It is now possible to change the frequency of smart baseline calculations. On systems that aggregate large amounts of data from parameters with smart baselines, it is recommended to increase this frequency, which is 5 minutes by default.

To change this setting, do the following:

1. Open the SLNetClientTest tool.
1. Go to *Advanced \> Options \> SLNet Options*.
1. Select the *SmartBaselineThreadTime* option and change its value.

Minimum value: 1 minute - Default value: 5 minutes

> [!WARNING]
> Always be extremely careful when using this tool, as it can have far-reaching consequences on the functionality of your DataMiner System.

#### External authentication using SAML: Extended logging [ID_33622]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.10 -->

When authenticating users using SAML, the following additional debug information will now be logged in the *SLSaml.txt* file:

- Whether Just-In-Time provisioning (JIT) is enabled.
- Which group claims are being used.

#### Dashboards app / Low-Code Apps: Support for feed categories in components [ID_33719]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.9 -->

Up to now, components could only produce one feed for each data type. Now support has been added for different categories within a data type, so that components will be able to produce several feeds for the same data type. This will for example make it possible for a component to produce a query row feed with the categories "timeline item" and "timeline band".

#### Skyline Device Simulator: Enhanced performance [ID_33761]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.9 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance of the Skyline Device Simulator tool has improved.

#### Maximum for element timeout setting increased to 24 hours [ID_33862] [ID_33951]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.9 -->

The maximum value for the element setting "*The element goes into timeout state when it is not responding for (sec)*" has now been increased from 120 seconds to 24 hours (i.e. 86400 seconds).

#### DataMiner Analytics: Improved handling of clearable alarms [ID_33910]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.9 -->

Up to now, DataMiner Analytics handled clearable alarms with severity "Normal" in the same way as cleared alarms. This meant that these were automatically removed from alarm groups (also known as incidents).

From now on, clearable alarms will keep the alarm focus from the last alarm in the alarm tree that had a non-normal severity. They will also stay in the same alarm group they were in before their severity became "Normal".

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhancements made to ResourceManagerHelper [ID_33993]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.9 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the ResourceManagerHelper class.

For example, from now on, an ArgumentNullException will be thrown when a NULL argument is provided. Also, when a collection with one or more NULL objects is provided, those objects will be ignored.

#### GQI: Improved performance of column filter [ID_34014]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.9 -->

Instead of a client-side filter, a more efficient server-side filter is now used to filter columns of a table component showing GQI data in a dashboard or low-code app. This will greatly improve the filter performance. However, because this server-side filter does not support "OR" filters, it will no longer be possible to combine multiple conditions within the same filter.

#### Dashboards / Low-Code Apps: Table filter improvements [ID_34022]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.9 -->

If you used the search box below a table displaying GQI data to filter this data, up to now, this could cause a serious load on the server in case a large number of rows had to be retrieved. To prevent this, the following conditions will now be applied to determine if more data should be retrieved:

- If the table already has enough rows to fill the next page, no further data will be retrieved.
- If the condition above is not met, at least 250 rows will retrieved initially.
- If at least one record is found that matches the search filter, no more rows will be retrieved. You will then need to click a "Load more" button to retrieve more data.
- If 2000 additional records have been retrieved after you click "Load more", no more data will be retrieved until you click the button again.
- If you scroll through the results, additional data will be fetched until there are enough rows to fill the next page.

#### Improved SPI logging for Automation [ID_34025]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.9 -->

The log levels of some of the log lines related to SPIs in the *SLAutomation* log file have been changed, so that the log file does not get flooded with potentially irrelevant data. In addition, these log lines will now contain the SPI node ID and definition ID. The log line mentioning the SPI definition ID when this definition is created will no longer be added.

#### Dashboards app / Low-Code Apps: No more statistics and suggestions for conditional coloring of Table and Node edge component [ID_34037]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.9 -->
<!-- Part of this RN is still in soft launch and consequently has not been documented yet -->

To improve performance, in the *Layout* pane for a Table or Node edge component, no more statistics and suggestions will be shown for conditional coloring.

#### SLLogCollector now also collects SLAnalytics configuration files [ID_34106]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.10 -->

Several SLAnalytics configuration files will now also be collected by the SLLogCollector tool. These will be placed in the *Logs/Skyline DataMiner/Analytics* and *Logs/Skyline DataMiner/Configuration* folders of the archive created by SLLogCollector.

#### GQI: Initial support for nested tables [ID_34144]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.9 -->

Initial support has been added for GQI results with cells containing nested records. However, at present this is only used for the *Resources* data source, which still requires the *GenericInterface* [soft-launch option](xref:SoftLaunchOptions).

The following functionality is now available for nested tables:

- Checking the number of records in nested tables. If a column with nested tables is retrieved, you cannot inspect the nested tables themselves yet, but a display value will show the number of records they contain.
- Aggregation on a single nested table column. There is no support for grouping yet. The aggregated value of the nested cell will be shown in the parent record as an ordinary cell.
- Filtering of nested tables.
- Selecting columns from nested tables. These will be shown in the same list box as regular columns, but their name will be prefixed by the parent column name. For example, if the parent column is named "Capabilities" and the nested table column is named "Name", the column will be listed as "Capabilities.Name".

#### Dashboards app / Low-Code Apps: Conditional coloring layout configuration now uses numeric filter instead of numeric slider [ID_34174]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.10 -->
<!-- Part of this RN is still in soft launch and consequently has not been documented yet -->

In the conditional coloring layout setting for Table and Node edge components, the numeric slider control has been replaced with a numeric filter. This has the following advantages:

- Full control over the boundaries. You can indicate whether the start and end should be in- or excluded.
- Possibility to not have a start or end boundary.
- More consistent with the free text filter.
- Easier to define a precise filter.

#### Dashboards app / Low-Code Apps: Conditional coloring layout filter configuration now shows discrete column values [ID_34182]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.10 -->
<!-- Part of this RN is still in soft launch and consequently has not been documented yet -->

In the conditional coloring layout setting for Table and Node edge components, discrete column values will now be displayed to make it easier to configure a filter.

#### GQI table column names will no longer include table names [ID_34302]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.10 -->

When a GQI table column inherits its name from a parameter of which the name includes the table name (between brackets), that table name will now be trimmed from the column name.

#### Improved performance of Resources module [ID_34205]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.10 -->

Because of enhancements to the way resources are processed and stored, the Resources module will now initialize more quickly.

In addition, performance has improved when a resource or resource pool is added or updated.

#### GQI: Enhanced performance of the ProfileInstance data source [ID_34320]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.11 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when running a GQI query using the ProfileInstance data source.

#### SLNet / SLDataGateway: Enhanced algorithm to find the first valid physical address of the DataMiner Agent [ID_34360]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.11 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the algorithm used by SLNet and SLDataGateway to find the first valid physical address of the DataMiner Agent.

#### GQI: Enhanced performance when retrieving table data [ID_34441]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when retrieving table data by means of a GQI query.

#### Dashboards app - Line & area chart: Non-trended parameters will now automatically be removed when the component is linked to a parameter feed [ID_34499]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

When a parameter feed is linked to a *Line & area chart" component, from now on, non-trended parameters will now automatically be removed from the chart.

#### Dashboards app - Parameter feed: 'Auto-select all' setting no longer available when using an EPM identifier feed as source [ID_34501]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.11 -->

When a parameter feed has an EPM identifier feed as source, from now on, the *Auto-select all* setting will no longer be available.

#### Dashboards app / Low-code apps - Line & area chart: Group label will no longer be displayed when grouping is set to 'All together' [ID_34544]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

In case a *Line & area chart* component displays trending for multiple parameters, the *Group by* setting allows you to specify how the graphs should be grouped. From now on, group titles will no longer be displayed when you set *Group by* to "All together".

#### SLElement: Enhanced alarm locking [ID_34561]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

Alarm locking in the SLElement process has been enhanced.

#### Dashboards app / Low-code apps: Enhanced performance of selection boxes [ID_34577]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when opening selection boxes, especially when they contain a large number of items.

#### Dashboards app: Upload size of PDF files will now be validated [ID_34620]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

When PDF files are uploaded via the WebAPI (e.g. when a PDF report is generated), an error will now be thrown when the batch size exceeds 10 MB or the total file size exceeds 1 GB.

#### Behavioral change points stored in both Cassandra and Elasticsearch [ID_34621]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

If an Elasticsearch database is available, the behavioral change points detected in trend data by the Behavioral Anomaly Detection feature will now be stored both in the Cassandra database and the Elasticsearch database. Otherwise, they will be stored in Cassandra only like before.

This will support faster and more flexible change point querying via GQI in future releases.

#### Dashboards app / Low-code apps - Visual Overview component: Enhancements with regard to WebSocket/polling settings and user access to visual overviews [ID_34624]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the visual overview component, especially with regard to the WebSocket/polling settings and the algorithm that checks whether users have access to the visual overviews retrieved by the component.

#### Enhanced parameter locking in SLElement [ID_34688]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.1 [CU0] -->

In SLElement, a number of enhancements have been made with regard to parameter locking.

#### Service & Resource Management: GetResources methods not using filter elements have now been marked as obsolete [ID_34720]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

In *ResourceManagerHelper* and *IResourceManagerHelper*, the following methods not using filter elements have now been marked as obsolete:

```csharp
IEnumerable<Resource> GetResources(IEnumerable<Resource> filters);
Resource[] GetResources(params Resource[] filters);
```

The following method should now be used instead:

```csharp
Resource[] GetResources(FilterElement<Resource> filter);
```

For example, you can now use the following call to retrieve all resources:

```csharp
var allResources = resourceManagerHelper.GetResources(new TRUEFilterElement<Resource>());
```

#### GQI: Enhanced performance when retrieving DomInstances that have a DomBehaviorDefinition [ID_34853]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when retrieving DomInstances that have a DomBehaviorDefinition.

#### SLAnalytics: Enhanced automatic evaluation of trend predictions [ID_34901]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, the automatic evaluation of trend predictions has improved.

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance when adding and updating bookings [ID_35016]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when creating and updating bookings.

### Fixes

#### SLAnalytics: Problem with trend prediction [ID_31352]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.1 -->

In some rare cases, an error could occur in SLAnalytics when calculating trend predictions.

#### Proactive cap detection: Problem with frequency of trend prediction calculations [ID_31447]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.2 -->

The “proactive cap detection” feature predicts future issues based on trend data in the Cassandra database, using advanced techniques that consider repeating patterns, information on the rate at which a parameter value increases or decreases, etc.

Up to now, in some cases, the frequency with which trend predictions were calculated would either be too low or too high.

#### Alarm templates: Incorrect calculation of smart baselines [ID_31601]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.6 -->

In some cases, smart baselines would be calculated incorrectly, especially when the “Skip the last X hours in the configured trend window” and “Handle weekend days separately” options were enabled.

#### Factory reset tool SLReset.exe did not remove a number of .lic files [ID_31722]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.1 -->

The factory reset tool `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Files\SLReset.exe` can be used to fully reset a DataMiner Agent to its state immediately after installation.

When run, it will now also remove the following files:

- ClientApps.lic
- request.lic (will be recreated after a DataMiner restart)
- chartDir.lic

#### Dashboards app: Dashboard names would incorrectly be allowed to contain backslash characters [ID_31735]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.1 -->

Up to now, it would incorrectly be allowed to enter a name containing backslash characters when creating or renaming a dashboard. From now on, this will no longer be allowed.

#### Service & Resource Management: Retrieving ReservationInstances sorted by a property of type string would return an incorrectly sorted result set [ID_32003]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.3 -->

When a list of ReservationInstances were retrieved sorted by a property of type string, that list would be returned in an incorrect sort order.

#### Mobile apps: Clients would not immediately receive updates when items were added [ID_32042]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.2 -->

When new items were added in one client, in some cases, those items would not immediately appear in other clients. For example, when a user created a ticket for a particular domain, other users viewing the list of tickets for that same domain would not immediately have their ticket list updated.

#### Cassandra: Problem when a NULL value was encountered in a logger table during a database migration [ID_32358]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.3 -->

When migrating a database to a Cassandra cluster, in some cases, an error could be thrown when a NULL value was encountered in a logger table.

#### Jobs app: No 'loading' indication when job sections were being loaded [ID_32616]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.4 -->

When configuring jobs, no “loading” indication would appear when job sections were being loaded.

#### Web services API: Problem with GetServiceTemplate [ID_32625]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.4 -->

The GetServiceTemplate method would throw an exception when requesting a service template with Text inputs that had neither of the following options:

- Require a valid element name
- Allow 'N/A' to indicate empty value

#### SLAnalytics: Inaccurate short-term trend predictions [ID_32731]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.5 -->

If the DataMiner Agent uses a Cassandra database, trend graphs can show how the value of a parameter in the graph is most likely to evolve in the future. Up to now, in some cases, short-term trend predictions could be inaccurate due to a longer seasonality being detected on a higher level.

#### Alarms and information events not migrated during migration to Cassandra Cluster [ID_32755]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.4 -->

When a DataMiner cluster with multiple DMAs was migrated to a Cassandra Cluster database, it could occur that the migration of alarms and information events failed because the DMAs tried to truncate the same table at the same time. Truncation will now take place in the initialization phase to prevent this problem, and if it fails, this will be logged but will not stop the migration. This will also prevent a rare problem where data could be missing after DMAs were migrated one by one.

#### SLAnalytics: Unneeded error was thrown when an upgrade action tried to remove the pattern match occurrences table from a non-existing Elasticsearch database [ID_32772]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.4 -->

On systems without an Elasticsearch database, the following messages were thrown when an upgrade action tried to remove the pattern match occurrences table from the non-existing Elasticsearch database:

```txt
10.102.0.12|2022-03-03 09:33:57|information|Elastic was not detected in DB.xml. Will not remove obsolete Elastic indices.
