### Enhancements

#### DataMiner Object Models: Enhanced performance when reading DOM objects and ModuleSettings [ID_35934]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when reading DOM objects and ModuleSettings.

#### SLLogCollector now also collects SyncInfo files [ID_35995]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

SLLogCollector packages will now also include all files found in `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Files\SyncInfo` relevant for troubleshooting.

#### Service & Resource Management: An error will now be thrown when an SRM event has been stuck for more than 15 minutes [ID_36013]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When an SRM event has been stuck for more than 15 minutes, the following run-time error will now appear in the Alarm Console:

```txt
Thread problem in SLNet: SRM event thread for booking with id <booking id>
```

This error will also be added to the *SLWatchDog2.txt* log file.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - This run-time error will appear when a custom booking event script that was configured to run synchronously has been running for more than 15 minutes. We highly recommend configuring custom events to run asynchronously. In the standard SRM Framework solution, you can [configure custom booking events](xref:Service_Orchestration_custom_events). In other SRM solutions, you can add booking events to the *ReservationInstance* object.
> - Half-open run-time errors (which are thrown after an SRM event has been stuck for more than 7.5 minutes) will also be added to the *SLWatchDog2.txt* log file.

### Fixes

#### Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool would incorrectly not migrate the state-changes table from a single-node Cassandra to a Cassandra Cluster [ID_35699]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you used the Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool to migrate a single-node Cassandra database to a Cassandra Cluster setup, up to now, the `state-changes` table would incorrectly not be migrated.

#### DataMiner Agent was not able to connect to the Cassandra database due to a problem with the TLS certificate [ID_35895]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When a DataMiner Agent was restarted after its database had been configured to use TLS, in some cases, it would not be able to connect to its Cassandra database due to a problem with the TLS certificate validation.

#### Updating a Resource or ResourcePool would incorrectly cause the 'CreatedAt' and 'CreatedBy' fields to be overwritten [ID_35913]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When a Resource or ResourcePool was updated, the *CreatedAt* and *CreatedBy* fields would incorrectly be overwritten.

#### Creating or updating a function resource while its parent element was in an error state would incorrectly be allowed [ID_35963]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When you created or updated a function resource while its parent element was in an error state, up to now, the state of that parent element would not be checked correctly. As a result, adding or updating the function resource would incorrectly be allowed.

From now on, when you create or update a function resource while its parent element is in an error state, an error will be thrown.

#### Spectrum analysis: Measurement points would not be set correctly [ID_36005]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

In some cases, measurement points would not be set correctly when a trace was being displayed.

#### Virtual functions linked to a parameter with a hysteresis timer could be assigned an incorrect alarm severity [ID_36024]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When a virtual function was linked to a parameter that had a hysteresis timer running, in some cases, that virtual function would be assigned an incorrect alarm severity.

#### SLReset.exe would not clean an Elasticsearch database when no <DB> element was specified in DB.xml [ID_36040]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When, in the *DB.xml* file, no `<DB>` element was specified for an Elasticsearch database, the factory reset tool *SLReset.exe* would not clean that database when the `cleanclustereddatabases` option had been used.

From now on, when no `<DB>` element is specified for a Elasticsearch database, *SLReset.exe* will use the default database name "dms".
