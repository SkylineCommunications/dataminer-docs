### Enhancements

#### Alarms generated when a database goes in offload mode will now have severity 'Notice' instead of 'Critical' [ID_35749]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When a database went in offload mode, up to now, an alarm with severity *Critical* was generated. From now on, an alarm of severity *Notice* will be generated instead.

#### SLAnalytics will no longer disregard first-time alarm template assignments [ID_35794]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

Up to now, SLAnalytics only took into account changes to alarm templates that were already assigned to elements and disregarded first-time alarm template assignments.

From now on, SLAnalytics will also take into account first-time alarm template assignments.

### Fixes

#### SLLogCollector: Problem when collecting multiple memory dumps with the 'Now and when memory increases with X Mb' option [ID_35617]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When the *SLLogCollector* tool had to collect memory dumps of multiple processes with the *Now and when memory increases with X Mb* option, it would incorrectly only collect the memory dump of the first process that reached the specified Mb limit.

From now on, it will collect at least the "now" dump for each of the selected processes.

#### SLElement could leak memory when updating alarm templates containing conditions [ID_35728]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.4 -->

In some cases, SLElement could leak memory when updating alarm templates containing conditions.

#### SLProtocol would interpret signed numbers incorrectly [ID_35796]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

SLProtocol would interpret signed numbers incorrectly, causing parameters to display incorrect values.
