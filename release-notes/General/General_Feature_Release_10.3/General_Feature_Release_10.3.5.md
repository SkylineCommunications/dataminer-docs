## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Alarms generated when a database goes in offload mode will now have severity 'Notice' instead of 'Critical' [ID_35749]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When a database went in offload mode, up to now, an alarm with severity *Critical* was generated. From now on, an alarm of severity *Notice* will be generated instead.

### Fixes

#### SLLogCollector: Problem when collecting multiple memory dumps with the 'Now and when memory increases with X Mb' option [ID_35617]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When the *SLLogCollector* tool had to collect memory dumps of multiple processes with the *Now and when memory increases with X Mb* option, it would incorrectly only collect the memory dump of the first process that reached the specified Mb limit.

From now on, it will collect at least the "now" dump for each of the selected processes.

#### SLProtocol would interpret signed numbers incorrectly [ID_35796]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

SLProtocol would interpret signed numbers incorrectly, causing parameters to display incorrect values.
