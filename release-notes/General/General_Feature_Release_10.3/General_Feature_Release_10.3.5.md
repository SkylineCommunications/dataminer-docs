### Enhancements

#### Security enhancements [ID_35668]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### SLAnalytics: A message will be added to the SLAnalytics.txt log file when no Cassandra database is present [ID_35748]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

Up to now, SLAnalytics would stop working without giving any notice whatsoever when it was started on a system without a Cassandra database.

From now on, when no Cassandra database is present, SLAnalytics will be stopped gracefully and a message will be added to the *SLAnalytics.txt* log file.

#### Alarms generated when a database goes in offload mode will now have severity 'Notice' instead of 'Critical' [ID_35749]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When a database went in offload mode, up to now, an alarm with severity *Critical* was generated. From now on, an alarm of severity *Notice* will be generated instead.

#### GQI: Raw datetime values retrieved from Elasticsearch will now be converted to UTC [ID_35784]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->
<!-- Not added to MR 10.4.0 -->

Up to now, after each step in a GQI query, raw datetime values were always converted to the time zone that was specified in the query options. From now on, raw datetime values retrieved from Elasticsearch will be converted to UTC instead. The time zone specified in the query options will now only be used when converting a raw datetime value to a display value.

#### SLAnalytics will no longer disregard first-time alarm template assignments [ID_35794]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

Up to now, SLAnalytics only took into account changes to alarm templates that were already assigned to elements and disregarded first-time alarm template assignments.

From now on, SLAnalytics will also take into account first-time alarm template assignments.

#### Business Intelligence: Enhancements with regard to the retrieval of data from logger tables and to general error handling [ID_35820]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the Business Intelligence module, especially with regard to the retrieval of data from logger tables and to general error handling.

### Fixes

#### SLLogCollector: Problem when collecting multiple memory dumps with the 'Now and when memory increases with X Mb' option [ID_35617]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When the *SLLogCollector* tool had to collect memory dumps of multiple processes with the *Now and when memory increases with X Mb* option, it would incorrectly only collect the memory dump of the first process that reached the specified Mb limit.

From now on, it will collect at least the "now" dump for each of the selected processes.

#### NATS would incorrectly be re-installed when a WMI query error occurred while the NATS installer was being run at DMA startup [ID_35647]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

When the NATS installer was being run at DMA startup, in some cases, due to an issue with a WMI query, NATS could incorrectly be re-installed, even though NATS and NAS were already running.

From now on, the execution of the NATS installer at DMA startup will be skipped when NATS is already running. Also, if an error occurs when running a WMI query during the execution of the NATS installer, a message saying that the re-installation has failed will be added to the *SLUMSEndpointManager.txt* log file.

> [!NOTE]
> When an error occurs while running a WMI query, and no NATS/NAS service is running, NATS will not be installed automatically. A manual installation of NATS will be needed.

#### DateTime instances would not get serialized correctly when an SLNet connection supported protocol buffer serialization [ID_35777]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

When an SLNet connection supported protocol buffer serialization, DateTime instances would not get serialized correctly.

#### SLProtocol would interpret signed numbers incorrectly [ID_35796]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

SLProtocol would interpret signed numbers incorrectly, causing parameters to display incorrect values.

#### SLAnalytics: Flatline events on child DVE elements would incorrectly be cleared automatically [ID_35818]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

Events generated after detecting change points of type "flatline" in trend data of child DVE elements would incorrectly be cleared automatically.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Every parameter included in an alarm template would incorrectly be considered a monitored parameter [ID_35832]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

SLAnalytics would incorrectly consider every parameter included in an alarm template to be a monitored parameter, even it is was not being monitored.

#### DataMiner Maps: Markers could disappear when a layer was enabled or disabled [ID_35838]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU14]/10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

In some cases, markers could disappear when a layer was enabled or disabled.

#### SLAnalytics could keep on waiting indefinitely for large delete operations to finish [ID_35848]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU2] - FR 10.3.5 -->

In some cases, SLAnalytics could keep on waiting indefinitely for large delete operations to finish.
