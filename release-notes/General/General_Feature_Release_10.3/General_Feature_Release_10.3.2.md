## Other features

#### All DOM objects now have 'LastModified', 'LastModifiedBy', 'CreatedAt' and 'CreatedBy' properties [ID_34980]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

All DOM objects (DomInstance, DomTemplate, DomDefinition, DomBehaviorDefinition, SectionDefinition and ModuleSettings) will now contain the following additional properties:

- *LastModified*: Date/time (UTC) at which the object was last modified.
- *LastModifiedBy*: Full username of the user who last modified the object.
- *CreatedAt*: Date/time (UTC) at which the object was created.
- *CreatedBy*: Full username of the user who created the object.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - *CreatedAt* and *CreatedBy* are automatically populated when the object is created. Any value assigned to these two fields by a user will always be discarded.
> - *LastModified* and *LastModifiedBy* are automatically updated when the object is updated on the server. Any value assigned to these two fields by a user will always be discarded. When an object is created, these fields will contain the same values as *CreatedAt* and *CreatedBy*.
> - These four fields are not directly accessible on the object. You first need to cast them to either *ITrackBase* or their individual interfaces (*ITrackLastModified*, *ITrackLastModifiedBy*, *ITrackCreatedAt* and *ITrackCreatedBy*).
>
>   `string createdBy = ((ITrackBase) domInstance).CreatedBy;`
>
> - These four fields can all be used in a filter.
> - In the Elasticsearch database, existing data will not contain values for these new fields (except the *LastModified* field for all but *ModuleSettings*).
> - All four fields are also available in the GQI data source *Object Manager Instances*. The *Last Modified* and *Created At* columns should show the time in the time zone of the browser.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### SLLogCollector will now first check for default.xml files in the LogConfig folder in the same location as SL_LogCollector.exe [ID_34739]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

Up to now, SLLogCollector expected custom collector configuration files named `default.xml` to always be placed in the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Tools\SLLogCollector\LogConfigs` folder.

From now on, it will first check the `LogConfig` folder in the same location as `SL_LogCollector.exe`. If that `LogConfig` folder does not exist, if the folder is empty or if the `default.xml` file in that folder cannot be deserialized, it will fall back on the `default.xml` file in the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Tools\SLLogCollector\LogConfigs` folder.

#### Web apps - Interactive Automation scrips: Fields containing invalid values will now be indicated more clearly [ID_34962]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

When, in an Automation script launched from a web app, an input field contains an invalid value, the border of that field will turn red. This red border will now be wider in order to be more visible.

#### GQI: Enhanced performance of GQI queries [ID_34977]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance of GQI queries has increased, especially when those queries contain join operations.

#### NAS service will now have a quoted image path [ID_34989]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

Up to now, the NAS service had an unquoted image path. From now on, it will instead be installed with a quoted path.

When you want the NAS service on existing setups to have a quoted path, do the following:

1. Execute the following command:

   `sc config NAS binPath="\"C:\Skyline DataMiner\NATS\nats-account-server\nssm.exe\""`

1. Restart NAS and NATS.

#### GQI: Enhanced performance of GQI queries using the 'Get parameters for elements where' data source [ID_35005]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance of GQI queries using the *Get parameters for elements where* data source has increased.

#### Dashboards app - Line & area chart: Multiple timespans will now be converted to one single time range [ID_35008]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

When a line & area chart component is fed a collection of timespans, it will now convert those timespans to one single time range.

For example, when a line & area chart component is fed the following timespans...

- *01/01/2022 9:00:00 > 01/01/2022 10:00:00*
- *01/01/2022 9:30:00 > 01/01/2022 10:30:00*

... it will convert those timespans into the following time range:

- *01/01/2022 9:00:00 > 01/01/2022 10:30:00*

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance when adding and updating bookings [ID_35016]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when creating and updating bookings.

#### SLAnalytics - Proactive cap detection: Enhanced accuracy when generating alarm predictions [ID_35080]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall accuracy has increased when generating alarm predictions.

#### Web app: More detailed version information in About box [ID_35090]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

In the *About* box of a web application, you can now find more detailed version information.

| Old name | New name | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| - | Server version | Server version and build number of the DataMiner Agent |
| Client build | Web version | Build number of the web app |
| Client version | App | Version number of the web app |
| Server API version | API | Version number of the Web Services API |

#### GQI: Enhanced query performance when aggregation operations are followed by a filter [ID_35110]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall query performance has increased, especially in cases where aggregation operations are followed by a filter.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection : More accurate change point time ranges [ID_35121]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, behavioral changes of the type "level shift", "trend change" and "variance change" will now have a more accurate time range when the change in behavior is sufficiently clear.

#### Dashboards - GQI components: Enhanced behavior when loading data [ID_35148]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Up to now, a loading skeleton would be displayed each time data was being loaded into a GQI component (e.g. a node edge graph). From now on, only when the component was empty will a loading skeleton be displayed. When existing data in the component is being refreshed, a loader bar will now be displayed instead.

#### Dashboards app - Line & area chart component: 'Group by' setting will now by default be set to 'All together' [ID_35160]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

In case a *Line & area chart* component displays trending for multiple parameters, the *Group by* setting allows you to specify how the graphs should be grouped. From now on, this *Group by* setting will by default be set to "All together".

#### SLAnalytics: Enhanced processing of parameter values 'exception' and 'other' [ID_35214]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall processing of "exception" or "other" parameter values by the SLAnalytics process has improved.

### Fixes

#### Problem with Elasticsearch health monitoring [ID_34744]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

When an Elasticsearch cluster used by DataMiner was hosted on servers that host IPv6 addresses, the Elasticsearch health monitoring in DataMiner would fail to assess the Elasticsearch cluster state and conclude that the indexing database was unavailable.

#### External authentication via SAML: Problem when using Okta as identity provider [ID_34745]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

When using external authentication via SAML, a software issue would prevent you from logging in when Okta was set up as identity provider.

#### Cassandra cluster: Nullreference exceptions [ID_34964]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

On systems with a Cassandra cluster, in some cases, messages to SLDataGateway could cause `nullreference` exceptions to be thrown.

Example of an exception stored in the `SLDBconnection.txt` log file:

```txt
SLDBConnection|Skyline.DataMiner.Net.Messages.SLDataGateway.DataRequest`1[Skyline.DataMiner.Net.Messages.SLDataGateway.Alarm]|INF|0|285|System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
   at SLCassandraClassLibrary.DBGateway.DBGateway.ExecuteRequest[T](DataRequest`1 request)
   at SLCassandraClassLibrary.DBGateway.IncomingConnection.$_executor_ExecuteRequest(BaseRequest request)
```

#### Problem with SLDataMiner when loading an alarm template schedule failed [ID_34988]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

In some cases, an error could occur in SLDataMiner when loading an alarm template schedule failed.

#### Alarm templates: Parameters exported to DVE child elements could have incorrect alarm limits [ID_34996]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

When a parameter was exported as a standalone parameter to a DVE child element, in some cases, the alarm limits could be incorrect when the type of alarm monitoring was set to either *Relative* or *Absolute*.

Also, LED bar controls would either not display or not update their alarm limits.

#### Dashboards app: Button to restore the initial view would incorrectly appear on all tables after sorting or filtering a table [ID_35003]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

When, on a dashboard, you sorted or filtered a table, a button to restore the initial view would incorrectly appear on all tables on that dashboard. Also, when you clicked one of those buttons, they would all disappear. From now on, when you sort or filter a table on a dashboard, a button to restore the initial view will only appear on that particular table.

#### Web apps - Visual Overview: Certain actions would no longer work [ID_35012]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

In some cases, *Card*, *Script*, *Link* and *Popup* actions would no longer work in visual overviews opened in web apps.

#### Hosting agent filters would be disregarded when alarm events were retrieved from an Elasticsearch database [ID_35049]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

When alarm events were retrieved from an Elasticsearch database, any hosting agent filters would be disregarded.

#### SLLogCollector would only take a dump of the first process when multiple processes were specified in the -d command-line option [ID_35074]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

When you ran SLLogCollector via the command line and specified multiple processes for which dumps had to be taken (e.g. `SL_LogCollector.exe -c -d=46436,61652`), it would incorrectly only take a dump of the first process.

#### Problem with the generation of TaskCancellationExceptions [ID_35079]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Modules using the managed SPI framework (Skyline.DataMiner.Spi) would trigger excessive numbers of TaskCancellationExceptions. Also, for the SLNet process, increasing numbers of these exceptions would be generated for every additional Cube client.

#### Monitoring app: Problem when opening the histogram page of a view [ID_35081]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

When, in the *Monitoring* app, you selected a view and opened the histogram page, in some cases, a `Maximum call stack size exceeded` error would appear.

#### Automation: Memory leak when using the engine.AddScriptOutput method to pass script output of type string [ID_35119]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

When an engine.AddScriptOutput method was used to pass output data of type string from a script to the application that executed it or from a subscript to the script that executed that subscript, that output data of type string would incorrectly not get cleared from memory.

#### Dashboards app: Visual Overview component would not show any content when linked to a feed [ID_35130]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

When a Visual Overview component was linked to a feed, in some cases, it would not show any content.

#### SLElement would leak memory when an element was frequently receiving timeout values [ID_35131]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

When an element was frequently receiving timeout values, SLElement would leak memory.

#### Protocols: Problem when using the 'partialSNMP' option when polling tables using the 'multipleGetNext' or 'multipleGetBulk' method [ID_35147]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

When the *partialSNMP* option was used when polling tables using the *multipleGetNext* or *multipleGetBulk* method, up to now, rows and values would be skipped when one or more columns did not contain values for one or more rows. This caused the next partial requests to jump forward by the amount of empty cells, resulting in missing rows and unexpected empty cells.

Also, a problem with the detection of infinite loops for SNMPv3 when receiving end-of-mib-view errors has been fixed.

#### Web apps - Parameter feed: Problem when more than 10,000 elements had to be retrieved from the server [ID_35150]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Up to now, a parameter feed would only retrieve the first 10,000 elements from the server. From now on, it will retrieve all elements from the server page by page.

Default number of elements per page: 10,000

#### Trending: One-day average trend records would no longer be written into the database [ID_35179]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

One-day average trend records would incorrectly only be written into the database if

- a TLL was specified, and
- the *MaintenanceSettings.xml* file contained an entry specifying the window size (e.g. `<TimeSpan1DayRecords windows="120" />`).

From now on, one-day average trend records will be written into the database as soon as a TTL setting has been configured for *Day records*.

Also, the default window size for the records has been restored to 120 minutes (i.e. 2 hours).
