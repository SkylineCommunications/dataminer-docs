## Other features

#### Dashboards app - GQI: New 'Get trend data patterns' data source [ID_35024]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

In the Generic Query Interface, a new *Get trend data patterns* data source is now available. It will return all trend data patterns in the DMS.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Web apps - Interactive Automation scrips: Fields containing invalid values will now be indicated more clearly [ID_34962]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

When, in an Automation script launched from a web app, an input field contains an invalid value, the border of that field will turn red. This red border will now be wider in order to be more visible.

#### GQI: Enhanced performance of GQI queries [ID_34977]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance of GQI queries has increased, especially when those queries contain join operations.

#### NAS service will now have a quoted image path [ID_34989]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

Up to now, the NAS service had an unquoted image path. From now on, it will instead be installed with a quoted path.

When you want the NAS service on existing setups to have a quoted path, do the following:

1. Execute the following command:

   `sc config NAS binPath="\"C:\Skyline DataMiner\NATS\nats-account-server\nssm.exe\""`

1. Restart NAS and NATS.

#### GQI: Enhanced performance of GQI queries using the 'Get parameters for elements where' data source [ID_35005]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance of GQI queries using the *Get parameters for elements where* data source has increased.

### Fixes

#### Problem with Elasticsearch health monitoring [ID_34744]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

When an Elasticsearch cluster used by DataMiner was hosted on servers that host IPv6 addresses, the Elasticsearch health monitoring in DataMiner would fail to assess the Elasticsearch cluster state and conclude that the indexing database was unavailable.

#### Problem with SLDataMiner when loading an alarm template schedule failed [ID_34988]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

In some cases, an error could occur in SLDataMiner when loading an alarm template schedule failed.

#### Dashboards app: Button to restore the initial view would incorrectly appear on all tables after sorting or filtering a table [ID_35003]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

When, on a dashboard, you sorted or filtered a table, a button to restore the initial view would incorrectly appear on all tables on that dashboard. Also, when you clicked one of those buttons, they would all disappear. From now on, when you sort or filter a table on a dashboard, a button to restore the initial view will only appear on that particular table.

#### Web apps - Visual Overview: Certain actions would no longer work [ID_35012]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

In some cases, *Card*, *Script*, *Link* and *Popup* actions would no longer work in visual overviews opened in web apps.

#### SLLogCollector would only take a dump of the first process when multiple processes were specified in the -d command-line option [ID_35074]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

When you ran SLLogCollector via the command line and specified multiple processes for which dumps had to be taken (e.g. `SL_LogCollector.exe -c -d=46436,61652`), it would incorrectly only take a dump of the first process.
