## 6.2.1

#### Improved encoding selection when executing a Get RPC [ID 42622]

The API in `GnmiClient` has been improved to ensure that it only uses an encoding that the target actually supports. Previously, every `Get` RPC defaulted to JSON, which could lead to `Unimplemented` exceptions if the target did not support it.

Now, the API first queries the target's capabilities to determine the available encodings and selects the most preferred one in a predefined order:

1. JSON
1. JSON_IETF
1. ASCII
1. Bytes
1. Proto

JSON remains the default to maintain backward compatibility, but if it is not supported, the next available option is used.

In cases where the target does not properly advertise its supported encodings or if the `Capabilities` RPC fails, the behavior remains unchanged, continuing to use JSON.

## 6.1.0

#### Prioritize connection to the local CommunicationGateway instance [ID 41784]

Previously, when multiple CommunicationGateway instances were available, the OpenConfig library would randomly select one to establish a connection. Now, the local CommunicationGateway instance will always be prioritized. If the local instance is unavailable, the library will fall back to the discovery process and randomly select another instance.

Minimum required version: [CommunicationGateway 5.1.0](xref:CommunicationGateway_change_log#28-january-2025---enhancement---communicationgateway-510---node-id-has-a-fixed-value-id-41784).

## 6.0.0
