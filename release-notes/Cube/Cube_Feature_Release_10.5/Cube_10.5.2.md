### Fixes

#### Visual Overview: Children shapes would be displayed twice [ID 41160]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When *Children* shapes were being loaded, in some cases, some shapes would incorrectly already be updated while loading was still in progress. As a result, some shapes would be displayed twice.

#### DataMiner Cube desktop app: Problem when starting an older version on a client on which a newer version has already been used [ID 41461]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When you started an older version of the DataMiner Cube desktop app on a client on which you had previously started a newer version of that same app, up to now, in some cases, the older version could update the desktop app configuration file, making it unusable for the newer version of the app.

From now on, when a newer version of the DataMiner Cube desktop app is found on a client, older versions of that same app will no longer be allowed to update the desktop app configuration file.

#### Alarm Console: Problem when an alarm tab and an AlarmSummary shape were being loaded simultaneously [ID 41484]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When, in the Alarm Console, an alarm tab was being loaded while, at the same time, a Visio shape containing a data field of type *AlarmSummary* was being loaded, in some cases, an exception could be thrown.

#### Protocols & templates: Problem when an update was received from the DMA while you were navigating through the app [ID 41494]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When, in the *Protocols & templates* app, you had selected a protocol, a protocol version and a template in order to check the list of assigned elements, up to now, other items could incorrectly get selected when an update unrelated to any of the items you selected was received from the DataMiner Agent to which you were connected.

#### Parameter-specific template editor would not load the correct template data for a non-table parameter of a DVE child element [ID 41510]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When you opened a parameter-specific alarm, trend or information template editor for a non-table parameter in a DVE child element (which is a table parameter in the DVE parent element), up to now, the template data would not get loaded correctly.

#### Visual Overview: Problem with counter showing the number of masked alarms when an AlarmSummary shape was linked to all alarms [ID 41513]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When you had linked an *AlarmSummary* shape to all alarms (i.e. active alarms, masked alarms and information events) by adding a data field of type *AlarmSummary* set to "all", the counter showing the number of masked alarms in the shape text (i.e. "#Masked") would show an incorrect number of alarms.

#### DataMiner Cube desktop app: First instance would incorrectly open in system tray mode instead of windowed mode [ID 41532]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When you opened a first instance of the DataMiner Cube desktop app on a client computer, up to now, it would incorrectly open in system tray mode. From now on, it will open in windowed mode instead.

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When, in a linked alarm tab, a correlation rule and its base alarms all matched the linked object, the alarm counters of that alarm tab would be incorrect when the correlation alarm was cleared while (some of) the base alarms remained active.

#### DataMiner Cube desktop app would not open when started from the DataMiner Taskbar Utility [ID 41556]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When you tried to open the DataMiner Cube desktop app from the DataMiner Taskbar Utility by selecting *Launch > DataMiner Cube*, the DataMiner Cube icon would appear in the system tray, but the app would incorrectly not be started.

#### Alarm Console: Cleared base alarm would incorrectly not be removed from an incident alarm [ID 41562]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When one of the base alarms of an incident alarm got cleared, in some cases, the incident alarm would incorrectly still show the cleared alarm as a base alarm.

#### DataMiner Cube desktop app: Problem when closing the app while configuration files were being updated [ID 41576]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When the DataMiner Cube desktop app was closed while its configuration files were being updated, in some cases, these files could get corrupted.

#### Correlation: Problem when correlation rules were updated in bulk [ID 41644]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When a number of correlation rules were updated in bulk, in some cases, some would either be skipped or not processed correctly.

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When, in Data Display, you double-clicked a parameter and then opened the *Templates* tab, the parameter thresholds would be incorrect when the alarm template was part of a template group.

#### Visual Overview - Children shape: Scale of automatically generated shapes would incorrectly be set to 0 [ID 41710]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

In some cases, the scale of automatically generated shapes would incorrectly be set to 0, causing those shapes to not be visible.

#### Memory leak when logging out of DataMiner Cube [ID 41712]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When you logged out of DataMiner Cube, up to now, certain event handlers would leak memory.

#### Problem when trying to uninstall DataMinerCube.exe [ID 41802]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->

When you tried to uninstall the *DataMinerCube.exe* file from a client computer via *Control Panel\Programs\Programs and Features*, an error would occur, causing both the *DataMinerCube.exe* file and an associated scheduled task to not get removed.

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU11] / 10.5.0 [CU0] - FR 10.5.2 -->
