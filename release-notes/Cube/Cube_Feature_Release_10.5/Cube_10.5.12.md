## Highlights

*No highlights have been selected yet.*

## New features

#### Trending: Double-clicking a RAD group incident will open a trend graph with up to 10 parameters of the RAD parameter group [ID 43798]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

From now on, when you double-click a RAD group incident, a trend graph will open, showing you up to 10 parameters of the associated RAD parameter group. When you click a single RAD suggestion event, a trend graph will open, showing you only the parameter associated with that suggestion event.

In the context menu of a RAD group incident as well as the context menu of a single suggestion event, you will now also find a new command in the *Open* submenu. Selecting that new command will have the same effect as double-clicking a RAD group incident. A trend graph will open, showing you up to 10 parameters of the associated RAD parameter group.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Parameter cache enhancements will improve overall visual overview loading performance [ID 43457]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

In order to reduce the time it takes to load a visual overview, a number of enhancements have been made to the parameter cache.

Throughout the lifecycle of a Cube session, the parameter cache will request and maintain certain parameter tables, and will keeping them updated.When data is requested from any of the tables in question, the data will be fetched from the cache instead of the DataMiner Agent.

##### Caching only certain columns

When [configuring caching of specific table parameters](https://aka.dataminer.services/configuring_caching_of_specific_table_parameters), it is now possible to configure that you only want certain columns of a table to be cached.

See the example configuration below. When configuring a table to be cached, you can now optionally add `"ColumnIDs":`, followed by a comma-separated list of column IDs. If you do so, only the columns you specified will be cached.

```json
{
    "DataMinerID": 956,
    "ElementID": 1846,
    "ParameterID": 1500,
    "SubscriptionFilter": null,
    "ColumnIDs": "1512"
},
{
    "DataMinerID": 956,
    "ElementID": 1845,
    "ParameterID": 1000,
    "SubscriptionFilter": null
},
{
    "DataMinerID": 41,
    "ElementID": 53742,
    "ParameterID": 1000,
    "SubscriptionFilter": null
}
```

In a `"SubscriptionFilter"` item, you can also specify a `COLUMNS=` filter. If you do so, this setting will take priority over any `"ColumnIDs"` item.

- If you specify a `COLUMNS=` filter inside a `"SubscriptionFilter"` item, only requests that use that specific subscription filter will use the cache. In other words, only Visio shapes with the same subscription filter as the one that is specified in the configuration file will then use the cache for the columns in question.

- If you add a separate `"ColumnIDs"` item, any request that matches the other settings for the table in question will make use of the cache if the column that is requested is the same as the column that is cached.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If you do not specify a `"ColumnIDs"` item, the entire table will be cached.
> - If the `"SubscriptionFilter"` item contains a `COLUMNS=` filter, any `"ColumnIDs"` item specified for the same table will be ignored.
> - In the configuration file, each table can only be configured once. It is not allowed to configure the same table multiple times with e.g. other columns.

##### Parameter blocks in filters now allow using wildcards in table keys

From now on, when retrieving data from the parameter cache, you can use \* and ? wildcards in table keys (\* representing any number of characters and ? representing one character in the specified spot).

For example, if a table has a display key named `qaTable 500_x` with `x` being a sequence number, and you want to fetch the fifth row, you will now be able to use the following filter: `<A>-A|MyElement|Parameter:507,qaTable*5|=Active` A display key named e.g. *qaTable 500_5* will then match the key specified in that filter.

##### Placeholders of type [param:] can now refer to cached table columns

From now on, when referring to a parameter ID in a [param:] placeholder, that parameter ID can also be an ID of a cached table column.

`[param:DmaID/ElementID,ParameterID]`

#### Automation, Correlation & Scheduler modules: List of dashboards that can be selected in 'Send email' actions will now be refreshed each time you open the Automation, Correlation, or Scheduler module [ID 43671]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

From now on, the list of dashboards that can be selected in *Send email* actions will now be refreshed each time you open the Automation, Correlation, or Scheduler module.

#### Custom Alarm Console hyperlinks linked to Automation scripts will no longer be hidden in the right-click menu of certain alarms [ID 43809]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

Up to now, custom hyperlinks linked to an Automation script would not be displayed in the right-click menu of an alarm of the type *Error* or *Notice* referring to the functionality of the DataMiner System or an alarm of type "Incident". From now on, these hyperlinks will be displayed.

Example of a custom hyperlinks linked to an Automation script:

```xml
<HyperLinks xmlns="http://www.skyline.be/config/hyperlinks">
    <!-- SECOND-GENERATION HYPERLINKS -->
    <HyperLink id="29"
        version="2"
        name="Send QA report by e-mail"
        menu="Scripts"
        type="script"
        alarmColumn="true">
    QA report by e-mail||||Tooltip|NoConfirmation
    </HyperLink>
</HyperLinks>
```

#### Cube UI: Enhanced filter option and error message [ID 43817]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

When, in the bottom-right corner of the *BELOW THIS VIEW* page of a view card, you clicked the filter icon, up to now, the bottom option would be *All devices (include subviews)*. This option has now been renamed to *Include subviews*.

Also, when the `SL_UNKNOWN_DESTINATION` exception was thrown, up to now, a message would appear, saying "The requested DMA could not be specified or is currently unknown". This message has now been changed to "Unable to find hosting agent. The agent might still be starting up or is currently unknown".

#### DataMiner Cube will now reuse the HTTP cookies of the gRPC connection [ID 43860]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

When DataMiner Cube performs a web request or when it displays a web browser control, it will now reuse the HTTP cookies of the gRPC connection. This will ensure that the requests are sent to the DataMiner Agent to which Cube is connected.

#### Credentials library: Details pane can now be scrolled horizontally [ID 43870]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

From now on, when working in the *Credentials library*, you will be able to horizontally scroll the details pane. This will e.g. make it easier to view very long passwords.

#### Automation, Correlation, and Scheduler: PDF report configuration window has been enlarged [ID 43898]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

In the Automation, Correlation, and Scheduler modules, you can generate a report based on a dashboard. When you do so, you can click the *Configure* button to open a window where you can configure the report. The size of this configuration window has now been changed from 800x600 pixels to 1200x900 pixels.

#### 'Automatic incident tracking' renamed to 'Alarm grouping' [ID 43903]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

Throughout the DataMiner Cube UI, 'Automatic incident tracking' has now been renamed to 'Alarm grouping'.

#### Alarm Console: Recursive loop detection in alarm trees [ID 43914]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

From now on, when alarms have been removed from alarm trees or when correlation base alarms have been added, DataMiner Cube will check whether there are loops in the alarm tree, i.e. whether the alarm tree contains any alarms that refer to themselves.

When a correlation alarm loop is detected, the following error will be added to the Cube logging and to SLClient.txt: "Cube Correlation nested alarm loop detected!"

#### Enhanced message box saying that an element that is part of a redundancy group or a service included in an SLA cannot be deleted [ID 43925]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

When you try to delete an element that is part of a redundancy group or a service included in an SLA, a message box will appear, saying that deleting the element is not possible.

A number of improvements have now been made to this message box. The name of the redundancy group or service will no longer be truncated, and the message box itself will now have a warning icon and a more descriptive title.

### Fixes

#### Trend graph showing high-value predictions would not get updated when you scrolled the predictions beyond the viewport [ID 43776]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

When you opened a trend graph showing trend data values with low Y values and predictions with very high Y values, up to now, the graph that resembled a flatline would incorrectly not get updated when you scrolled the predictions beyond the viewport.

#### Problem when switching themes while trend graphs were open [ID 43777]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

When, in DataMiner Cube, you opened a trend graph and then switched to another theme, up to now, errors would start to appear in the logging.

Also, the trend graph colors would incorrectly not get updated.

#### Trending: Trend graphs for parameters of new elements would not always be displayed correctly [ID 43792]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

The first time you opened a trend graph for a parameter of a new element, the graph would be displayed correctly, but from the second time onwards, the graph would either be shown correctly or would show "No data".

From now on, when you open a trend graph for a parameter of a new element, the graph will always be displayed correctly. It will show "No data" when no data could be found.

#### Problem when routing requests related to a swarmed element or an element migrated via a DELT package [ID 43815]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

In some cases, a request from DataMiner Cube related to a swarmed element or an element migrated via a DELT package would not get routed to the correct DataMiner Agent.

For example, when an element card showing a table with context menus was open while the element in question was swarmed to another DMA, after the swarming operation, it would no longer be possible to select items from those context menus.

Also, it would not be possible to rename swarmed elements or elements migrated via a DELT package from the element list on a view card.

#### Cube would incorrectly attempt to retrieve Catalog package information for automation scripts [ID 43872]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

When connected to a system without an indexing database, up to now, DataMiner Cube would incorrectly attempt to retrieve Catalog package information for automation scripts. From now on, it will only do so when connected to a system with an indexing database.

#### Changing the protocol version of an element would incorrectly affect the element's 'Skip SSL/TLS certificate verification (insecure)' connection options [ID 43932]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

When, in DataMiner Cube, you changed the protocol version of an element that had connections of which the *Skip SSL/TLS certificate verification (insecure)* option was enabled, up to now, this option would incorrectly no longer be enabled.

From now on, changing the protocol version of an element will no longer affect any *Skip SSL/TLS certificate verification (insecure)* options.

#### Profiles: Profile parameters would incorrectly be marked as modified when their discrete values were not sorted alphabetically [ID 43965]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

When, in DataMiner Cube, you opened the Profiles module, profile parameters with discrete values that were not sorted alphabetically would incorrectly be marked as modified.

#### DMA would incorrectly be added to a cluster when authentication had failed [ID 43977]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

When, in DataMiner Cube, you try to add a DataMiner Agent to an existing cluster, you have to enter your user credentials.

Up to now, in some cases, the DataMiner Agent would incorrectly be added to the cluster, even when authentication had failed.
