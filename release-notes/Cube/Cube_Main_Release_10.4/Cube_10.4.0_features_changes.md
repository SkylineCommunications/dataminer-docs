# DataMiner Cube Main Release 10.4.0 â€“ Other new features & changes - Preview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are still working on this release. Some release notes may still be modified or moved to a later release. Check back soon for updates!

## Other new features

#### System Center - Analytics config: New Pattern Matching setting 'Maximum memory usage' [ID_34803]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

In the *System settings > Analytics config* section of *System Center*, you can now find a new setting under *Pattern Matching*: *Maximum memory usage*.

This setting allows you to specify the maximum amount of memory that SLAnalytics will use to cache recurring patterns in trend data (in GB).

Default value: 2.00 GB

#### Visual Overview: Session variable YAxisResources now supports filters [ID_34857]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

From now on, you can pass resource exposers as a filter to the *YAxisResources* session variable in order to show the corresponding resource bands.

Using a filter that results in less than 100 resources is recommended to avoid delay while loading the bands.

A converter has also been created in the client that will convert a profile parameter name to the ID of the found object. For this, the format [ProfileParameter:xxx,ID] should be used, replacing "xxx" with the name of the capacity/capability profile parameter.

> [!NOTE]
> For examples, refer to [YAxisResource session variable examples](xref:YAxisResource_Shape_Data_Examples) in the user guide.

#### Trending - Pattern matching: Colors will now be used to differentiate how matches were detected [ID_34898] [ID_34947]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Up to now, matches found for the same element/parameter as the one for which a tag was defined were shown in bright orange, while matches associated with tags created for another element/parameter were shown in lighter orange. From now on, those colors will be used to indicate how the matches were detected:

- Matches detected by means of the so-called *streaming method* will be shown in bright orange.

  These matches are detected while tracking for trend patterns whenever a trended parameter is updated. When such a match is detected, a suggestion event is generated.

- Matches detected by means of the so-called *non-streaming method* will be shown in lighter orange.

  These matches are detected only when trend data is fetched from the database after you opened a trend graph.

> [!NOTE]
> Only matches detected by means of the so-called *streaming method* will be stored in the database.

#### Visual Overview: New placeholders can now be added to a 'ShapeGrouping' shape [ID_34974]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

Up to now, when you enabled grouping of dynamically positioned shapes, you were able to display the number of shapes that were grouped into a single group shape by adding an asterisk ("\*") in the *ShapeGrouping* shape.

From now on, you can also add the following placeholders in the *ShapeGrouping* shape:

- Add `[GroupValue]` to make the shape display the value that is specified in the *GroupBy* shape data field of the first child shape in the group.

  If this *GroupBy* value contains multiple column parameters and/or properties, they will be separated by commas.

- Add `[Count]` to make the shape display the number of child shapes in the group (similar to adding an asterisk).

The placeholders `[GroupValue]` and `[Count]` can be added simultaneously as well.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Alarm Console: Automatic incident tracking will now make use of the parameter relationship data that is stored in a model managed by the ModelHost DxM [ID_34684]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

The *automatic incident tracking* feature groups active alarms that are related to the same incident, so that the Alarm Console provides a better overview of the current issues in the system. From now on, on cloud-connected DataMiner Agents that have the DataMiner Extension Module *ModelHost* installed and that have been configured to [offload alarm and change point events to the cloud](xref:Controlling_cloudfeed_data_offloads), this feature will also make use of the parameter relationship data that is stored in a model managed by the *ModelHost* DxM.

#### Trending - Parameter relationships: Enhancements [ID_34832] [ID_34846] [ID_34863] [ID_34938]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the parameter relationship feature. When you hover over a light bulb icon in the top-right corner of a trend graph, a tooltip will now appear. This tooltip will suggest you add a number of related parameters and will indicate that the parameter relationship feature is still in preview. Also, when you open a histogram, no light bulb icon will be displayed anymore as parameter relationships are not really relevant when viewing histograms.

#### Trending - pattern matching: Enhanced feedback when creating a trend pattern tag failed [ID_34963]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Up to now, when the creation of a trend pattern tag failed, the general error message `Consider increasing or decreasing  the tag time range selection and try again.` was displayed. From now, one of the following, more detailed messages will be displayed instead:

```txt
Failed to save your tag. Consider reducing the tag time range selection and try again.

Failed to save your tag. The data covered by the tag time range selection contains too little detail. Consider increasing the tag time range selection and try again.

Failed to save your tag. A tag time range was selected for which not all trend data can be retrieved. Consider adjusting the tag time range selection and try again.

Failed to save your tag. The defined patterns cannot be linked into the multivariate pattern. Consider adjusting its configuration and try again.
```

### Fixes

#### Profiles app: A profile instance would incorrectly list parameters that had been removed from the profile definition [ID_34679] [ID_34771]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

When a parameter had been removed from a profile definition, in the *Profiles* app, the profile instances referring to the profile definition in question would incorrectly still list the parameter that had been removed.
