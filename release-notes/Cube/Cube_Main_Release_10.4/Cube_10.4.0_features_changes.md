# DataMiner Cube Main Release 10.4.0 â€“ Other new features & changes - Preview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are still working on this release. Some release notes may still be modified or moved to a later release. Check back soon for updates!

## Other new features

#### System Center - Analytics config: New Pattern Matching setting 'Maximum memory usage' [ID_34803]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

In the *System settings > Analytics config* section of *System Center*, you can now find a new setting under *Pattern Matching*: *Maximum memory usage*.

This setting allows you to specify the maximum amount of memory that SLAnalytics will use to cache recurring patterns in trend data (in GB).

Default value: 2.00 GB

#### Visual Overview: Session variable YAxisResources now supports filters [ID_34857]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

From now on, you can pass resource exposers as a filter to the *YAxisResources* session variable in order to show the corresponding resource bands.

Using a filter that results in less than 100 resources is recommended to avoid delay while loading the bands.

A converter has also been created in the client that will convert a profile parameter name to the ID of the found object. For this, the format [ProfileParameter:xxx,ID] should be used, replacing "xxx" with the name of the capacity/capability profile parameter.

> [!NOTE]
> For examples, refer to [YAxisResource session variable examples](xref:YAxisResource_Shape_Data_Examples) in the user guide.

> [!TIP]
> See also: [Service & Resource Management: Exposers for resource capacities and capabilities](xref:General_Main_Release_10.4.0_new_features#service--resource-management-exposers-for-resource-capacities-and-capabilities-id_34841)

#### Trending - Pattern matching: Colors will now be used to differentiate how matches were detected [ID_34898] [ID_34947]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Up to now, matches found for the same element/parameter as the one for which a tag was defined were shown in bright orange, while matches associated with tags created for another element/parameter were shown in lighter orange. From now on, those colors will be used to indicate how the matches were detected:

- Matches detected by means of the so-called *streaming method* will be shown in bright orange.

  These matches are detected while tracking for trend patterns whenever a trended parameter is updated. When such a match is detected, a suggestion event is generated.

- Matches detected by means of the so-called *non-streaming method* will be shown in lighter orange.

  These matches are detected only when trend data is fetched from the database after you opened a trend graph.

> [!NOTE]
> Only matches detected by means of the so-called *streaming method* will be stored in the database.

#### Visual Overview: New placeholders can now be added to a 'ShapeGrouping' shape [ID_34974]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

Up to now, when you enabled grouping of dynamically positioned shapes, you were able to display the number of shapes that were grouped into a single group shape by adding an asterisk ("\*") in the *ShapeGrouping* shape.

From now on, you can also add the following placeholders in the *ShapeGrouping* shape:

- Add `[GroupValue]` to make the shape display the value that is specified in the *GroupBy* shape data field of the first child shape in the group.

  If this *GroupBy* value contains multiple column parameters and/or properties, they will be separated by commas.

- Add `[Count]` to make the shape display the number of child shapes in the group (similar to adding an asterisk).

The placeholders `[GroupValue]` and `[Count]` can be added simultaneously as well.

#### Visual Overview - ListView: Highlighting rows based on booking color [ID_35157]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

If you add "ColorRows=True" to the *ComponentOptions* shape data field of a ListView component, the highlight color of the list view rows will be set to the booking color.

The booking color is a summary of the following reserved booking properties: *VisualForeground*, *VisualBackground*, *VisualSelectedForeground* and *VisualSelectedBackground*. Each of those properties can be set to a string value representing a hexadecimal value, an (A)RGB value or a predefined Windows color (the latter is not recommended).

Configuring gray-tinted foreground colors is not recommended as a ListView component uses a gray layer when you hover over its items. In the Skyline themes, that gray layer has the following color:

| Theme | Color of gray layer        |
|-------|----------------------------|
| Mixed | #E5E5E5 (RGB: 229,229,229) |
| Light | #E5E5E5 (RGB: 229,229,229) |
| Black | #333333 (RGB: 51,51,51)    |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The *ColorRows* feature is disabled by default ("ColorRows=False").
> - At present, the *ColorRows* feature is only available on ListView components that have bookings as a source.

#### Visual Overview - ListView: Copying list data to the Windows clipboard [ID_35170]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

The ListView component now allows you to copy data from the list to the Windows clipboard.

To copy the contents of one or more rows:

1. Select the row(s).
1. Choose *Copy selected row(s)*.

To copy the contents of a single cell:

1. Right-click in the cell.
1. Choose *Copy \<cell contents\>*.

The data copied to the Windows clipboard is split into a header section and a data section, separated by an empty line. The header section contains the column names, while the data section contains the actual row data.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Only the columns that are visible to the user will be copied to the Windows clipboard. Also, the order of the columns will be identical to the order of the columns in the ListView component. Note that column visibility and column order can be configured using the component's column manager.
> - When you copy one or more rows, only cells that contain text will be included. For example, cells that only contain a colored rectangle will not be included. Also, when you try to copy the contents of a single cell, the *Copy \<cell contents\>* command will only be available if that cell contains text.

#### Visual Overview: Visualizing EPM object statistics in a shape [ID_35222]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

It is now possible to display the statistics of an EPM object in a shape linked to that EPM object.

1. Link the shape to the EPM object via the *SystemName* and *SystemType* shape data fields.

1. Add an asterisk character ("\*") in the shape text.

1. Add a shape data field of type *Info* to the shape, and set its value to e.g. `EPM STATISTICS:###[#TotalAlarms]`.

The following information can be displayed:

```txt
#TotalAlarms
#CriticalAlarms
#MajorAlarms
#MinorAlarms
#WarningAlarms
#NormalAlarms
#TimeoutAlarms
#NoticeAlarms
#ErrorAlarms
```

#### Visual Overview - ListView component: New component option 'SingleSelectionMode' [ID_35320]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.4 -->

By default, you can select multiple rows in a list view (e.g. using the CTRL or SHIFT key). With the new component option *SingleSelectionMode*, you can now set the selection mode of a list view to single instead, so that only one row can be selected at a time.

#### Visual Overview: Re-arranging grouped shapes [ID_35323]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.4 -->

When, in a Visio drawing, shapes had been positioned dynamically based on properties, up to now, it was possible to re-arrange individual shapes manually. From now on, it will also be possible to re-arrange grouped shapes.

#### System Center: New DataMiner log file 'SLSmartBaselineManager.txt' [ID_35352]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

In the *Logging* section of *System Center*, you can now also consult the *SLSmartBaselineManager.txt* log file.

#### Embedded web apps can now interact with Cube when using the Microsoft Edge (WebView2) browser plugin [ID_35655]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.4 -->

From now on, when using the Microsoft Edge (WebView2) web browser plugin, embedded web apps can interact with Cube (e.g. open an element card).

#### Users no longer have to log in to embedded low-code apps [ID_35657]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.4 -->

When a low-code app was embedded in Cube (e.g. in a visual overview), up to now, users had to explicitly log in to that app. From now on, Cube will automatically pass the authentication ticket to the low-code app, allowing users to access the app without having to log in again.

#### Trending: Managing trend patterns in the 'Pattern Overview' window [ID_35694] [ID_36114]

<!-- 35694: MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->
<!-- 36114: MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.6 -->
<!-- Both released in MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.6 -->

When you right-click a trend graph and select *Trend patterns...*, the *Pattern Overview* window will now appear.

By default, this window will only list the existing patterns that apply to the trend graph you have opened. If you select the *Show all patterns* option, it will list all patterns found in the DataMiner System.

- To update the properties of an existing pattern, select it in the list on the left, update its properties, and click *OK* or *Apply*.

  Apart from changing its name and description, you can also indicate whether you want the pattern to be detected continuously in the background.

- To delete a pattern, click the recycle bin icon next to its name in the list on the left.

When you select a trend pattern from the list on the left, a thumbnail preview of the pattern will be displayed, together with the name of the element and parameter associated with the pattern.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, this *Pattern Overview* window only supports single-variate patterns. Support for multi-variate patterns will be added in a later release.

#### Search box in Cube header can now be hidden [ID_35826]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.5 -->

It is now possible to either show or hide the search box in the middle of the Cube header bar.

1. Open the *Settings* app.
1. Go to *Cube* > *Cube header*.
1. Select or clear the *Display search box in header* option, and click *Apply*.

Alternatively, you can also open the quick menu in the Cube header, and toggle the *Show search box* option.

#### Open element cards will immediately show any changes made with regard to parameters [ID_36286]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.8 -->

When an element card is open, each time a new parameter is added to the element or an existing parameter is updated, the change will be applied in real time. You will no longer need to close the card and open it again to see the changes.

#### Resources app: Duplicating a resource [ID_36308]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.7 -->

In the *Resources* app, it is now possible to duplicate a resource.

To do so, right-click a resource in the list, and select *Duplicate*.

- The name of the newly created duplicate resource will be the name of the original resource with the suffix `- copy` added to it.

- All general information, properties and device data will be copied from the original resource to the duplicate resource.

- The duplicate resource will be added to all resource pools that contain the original resource.

- If you make a duplicate of a function resource, the instance dropdown will be left empty and the name of the function instance will be the name of the original function instance with the suffix `- copy`.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Special Elasticsearch search box always visible on systems with a Cassandra Cluster database [ID_36735]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

When you add a new alarm tab to the Alarm Console, that alarm tab will now always show the Elasticsearch search box when you are connected to a DataMiner System with a Cassandra Cluster database.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, when you start typing in this search box, no suggestions are displayed yet.

#### Alarm Console: Light bulb [ID_36777] [ID_36871] [ID_36918] [ID_37057] [ID_37136] [ID_37145] [ID_37167] [ID_37184]

<!-- RNs 36777/36871/36918: MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->
<!-- RNs 37057/37136/37145/37167/37184: MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->

In the top-right corner of the Alarm Console, you can now find a light bulb icon that will light up when there are alarms or suggestion events related to an SLAnalytics feature. When you click this light bulb, a menu will open, possibly showing you the following notifications:

| Notification | Action when clicked |
|--------------|---------------------|
| X alarms require your focus in the current tab | Applies a filter that makes the current tab only list the focused alarms. |
| Also show alarms not requiring focus      | Clears the above-mentioned filter and makes the current tab list all alarms. |
| X incidents are present on the system     | Opens a new tab listing all active incidents. |
| X anomalies were found in your trend data | Opens a new tab listing all anomaly suggestions/alarms. |
| X alarms are predicted in the near future | Opens a new tab listing all prediction suggestions. |
| X recent pattern occurrence detected      | Opens a new tab listing all trend pattern suggestions. |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Each of the above-mentioned notifications will only appear in the menu when there is at least one alarm, incident, anomaly or pattern occurrence.
> - When at least one SLAnalytics feature (alarm focus, automatic incident tracking, behavioral anomaly detection, proactive cap detection or pattern matching) is disabled or not available, a link to [Advanced analytics features in the Alarm Console](xref:Advanced_analytics_features_in_the_Alarm_Console) will appear below the light bulb icon.
> - If the DataMiner System does not include a Cassandra database, the menu will only show a notification saying the Cassandra is required.

#### Visual Overview: New custom color 'bg.pressededitor' for parameter controls of type 'Lite' [ID_36779]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

When you turn a shape into a parameter control of type "Lite", you can use the *CustomColors* option to customize the colors of that parameter control.

You can now define a new color called *bg.pressededitor*. This color will be used as background when the left mouse button is pressed within the editor part of the control.

For more information, see [CustomColors](xref:Adding_options_to_a_parameter_control#customcolors).

#### Trending - Pattern matching: Pattern highlighted when mouse pointer hovers over label [ID_36863]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->
<!-- For fix included in same RN, see Fixes. -->

When you hover the mouse pointer over the pattern labels for a trend graph, now the corresponding pattern occurrences (both univariate and multivariate) are highlighted in the graph.

#### Proportional card layout: Selecting a master card [ID_36912]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

When the card layout is set to "Proportional", you can now promote one card to master card. To do so, click the card's hamburger menu, and select the *Master card* option.

Once you have turned a card into the master card, each time you open a new card it will replace the master card.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - At any given time, there can be only one master card.
> - This feature cannot be used in conjunction with pinning. When, in a card's hamburger menu, you select the *Master card* option, the *Pin this card* option will be disabled (and vice versa).

#### Proportional card layout: Marking cards as non-closable [ID_36956]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

When the card layout is set to "Proportional", you can now mark cards to non-closable. To do so, click the card's hamburger menu, and select the *Hide close button* option.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature cannot be used in conjunction with pinning. When, in a card's hamburger menu, you select the *Hide close button* option, the *Pin this card* option will be disabled (and vice versa).

#### Protocols & Templates app: Editing, deleting and duplicating elements [ID_36971]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->

When, in the *Protocols & Templates* tab of the *Protocols & Templates* app, you right-click an element in the *Elements* column, the shortcut menu will now contain the following additional commands if you have been granted the necessary user permissions:

- *Edit*: Opens a card that allows you to edit the selected element.
- *Delete*: Deletes the selected element after you have clicked *Yes* in the confirmation box.
- *Duplicate*: Opens a card that allows you to create a new element based on the configuration of the selected element.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - DVE elements cannot be deleted or duplicated in the way described above. The parent element is responsible for creating or deleting such elements.
> - It is no longer possible to create elements using a *Mediation Layer* protocol from within the *Protocols & Templates* app. Also, it is no longer possible to create new alarm templates or trend templates for *Mediation Layer* protocols.

#### Alarm Console: No 'Include masked alarms' option anymore when creating a history tab [ID_37020]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->

When you added a new history tab in the *Alarm Console*, up to now, you could select the *Include masked alarms* option. This option has now been removed.

From now on, when you select the *Include alarms* option, the masked alarms will automatically be included as well. When you select the *Include information events* option or the *Include suggestion events* option, the masked alarms will not be included.

> [!NOTE]
> When you add a new tab of type "sliding window", you will still be able to select the *Include masked alarms* option.

#### Trending - Pattern matching: Pattern occurrences will now be added to a trend graph in real time [ID_37153]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->

DataMiner Cube now supports pattern occurrence events. This means that occurrences of patterns that are already displayed on a trend graph will be added in real time.

#### Spectrum analysis: Panning horizontally inside a spectrum window [ID_37284]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.11 -->

It is now possible to pan horizontally inside a spectrum window by clicking and dragging.

When, after clicking the left mouse button, you start dragging, the following will happen:

- The spectrum trace will move to the left or the right while being refreshed at a rate equal to the original rate.
- The start, stop and center frequency labels on the X axis will continuously update to reflect the ongoing change.
- The unknown part of the trace (i.e. the frequency range located outside of the original span) will be visualized as a grey area with a grid in the background.

When you stop dragging and release the left mouse button, the panning dimensions will be set on the spectrum analyzer device and the screen will be updated with the new data.

Only upon releasing the left mouse button will the unknown part of the trace be requested from the spectrum analyzer. The newly received trace points will then replace the grey area and a new, uniform spectrum trace will be displayed based on the new center frequency.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is only available if the spectrum protocol includes the *Start Frequency*, *Center Frequency* and *Stop Frequency* parameters.

#### Credentials Library now supports username and password credentials [ID_37416]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.11 -->

In the Credentials Library in DataMiner Cube (available via *System Center* > *System Settings* > *Credentials Library*), you can now configure a new type of credentials, i.e. username and password credentials. To do so, in the *Type* dropdown, select *Username and password credentials*, and then specify the username and password.

#### Spectrum analysis: Panning vertically inside a spectrum window [ID_37461]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.11 -->

It is now possible to pan vertically inside a spectrum window by CTRL+clicking and dragging.

When, after pressing the CTRL key and clicking the left mouse button, you start dragging, the following will happen:

- The spectrum trace will move up or down while being refreshed at a rate equal to the original rate.
- The amplitude labels on the Y axis will continuously update to reflect the ongoing change.
- The unknown part of the trace (i.e. the amplitude range located outside of the original span) will be visualized as a grey area with a grid in the background.

When you stop dragging and release the left mouse button, the panning dimensions will be set on the spectrum analyzer device and the screen will be updated with the new data.

Only upon releasing the left mouse button will the unknown part of the trace be requested from the spectrum analyzer. The newly received trace points will then replace the grey area and a new, uniform spectrum trace will be displayed based on the new reference level.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is only available if the spectrum protocol includes the *Reference level* parameter.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Alarm Console: Automatic incident tracking will now make use of the parameter relationship data that is stored in a model managed by the ModelHost DxM [ID_34684]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

The *automatic incident tracking* feature groups active alarms that are related to the same incident, so that the Alarm Console provides a better overview of the current issues in the system. From now on, on cloud-connected DataMiner Agents that have the DataMiner Extension Module *ModelHost* installed and that have been configured to [offload alarm and change point events to the cloud](xref:Controlling_cloudfeed_data_offloads), this feature will also make use of the parameter relationship data that is stored in a model managed by the *ModelHost* DxM.

#### Trending - Parameter relationships: Enhancements [ID_34832] [ID_34846] [ID_34863] [ID_34938]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.1 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the parameter relationship feature. When you hover over a light bulb icon in the top-right corner of a trend graph, a tooltip will now appear. This tooltip will suggest you add a number of related parameters. Also, when you open a histogram, no light bulb icon will be displayed anymore as parameter relationships are not really relevant when viewing histograms.

#### Trending - pattern matching: Enhanced feedback when creating a trend pattern tag failed [ID_34963]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Up to now, when the creation of a trend pattern tag failed, the general error message `Consider increasing or decreasing the tag time range selection and try again.` was displayed. From now, one of the following, more detailed messages will be displayed instead:

```txt
Failed to save your tag. Consider reducing the tag time range selection and try again.

Failed to save your tag. The data covered by the tag time range selection contains too little detail. Consider increasing the tag time range selection and try again.

Failed to save your tag. A tag time range was selected for which not all trend data can be retrieved. Consider adjusting the tag time range selection and try again.

Failed to save your tag. The defined patterns cannot be linked into the multivariate pattern. Consider adjusting its configuration and try again.
```

#### Trending - Pattern matching: A slightly larger number of missing values will now be allowed when you create a trend pattern tag [ID_35376]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

When you try to create a trend pattern tag, an error message will appear when there are too many missing values in the selected pattern.

From now on, a slightly larger number of missing values will be allowed will you create a trend pattern tag.

#### Trending: Check marks will no longer appear in front of related parameters after adding them to the trend graph [ID_35518]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

In the top-right corner of a trend graph, a light bulb icon appears when DataMiner finds parameters that are related to the parameters shown in the trend graph. Clicking this light bulb icon allows you to add one or more of those related parameters to the trend graph you are viewing.

Up to now, when you clicked one of those related parameters in order to add it to the trend graph, a check mark would appear in front of it. From now on, check marks will no longer appear in front of related parameters after selecting them.

#### Automation script editor: Intellisense added for timeUpDownConfig.ShowTimeUnits [ID_35672]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.4 -->

In the Automation script editor, Intellisense has been added for the new `timeUpDownConfig.ShowTimeUnits` property.

This property is only applied in interactive Automation scripts that are launched from a web app.

#### DataMiner Cube desktop app: Unused Cube versions will now automatically be removed [ID_35795]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.6 -->

From now on, Cube versions that meet the following conditions will be removed automatically:

- Not marked as the active version for a certain DataMiner Agent.
- Not downloaded recently.
- Not used recently.

#### Trending - Parameter relationships: Light bulb icon is now always displayed in top-right corner of trend graph and has one of three states [ID_35868] [ID_36157] [ID_36199]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.6 Also see Fixes-->

In the top-right corner of a trend graph, a light bulb icon was previously only displayed if DataMiner found relations for the parameters shown in the trend graph. From now on, this icon will always be visible, regardless of whether related parameters have been found and whether all necessary requirements for the parameter relationship feature are met. The light bulb icon can now have one of three states:

- Related parameters have been found.
- No related parameters have been found.
- The requirements have not been met.

When related parameters have been found, the light bulb icon will "light up" in an accent color to provide a visual indication of its state.

If any of the mandatory requirements for the parameter relationship feature have not been met, clicking the light bulb icon in the top-right corner of the trend graph will show a message that indicates the requirements are not met.

If any of the optional requirements for the parameter relationship feature have not been met, clicking the light bulb icon in the top-right corner of the trend graph will show a message that advises to unlock all capabilities of this feature.

Both messages are clickable and link to the relevant section of the DataMiner documentation.

#### Visual Overview: Browser shapes will no longer be reloaded when their URL only had a fragment change [ID_36044] [ID_36104]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.6 -->

Up to now, a browser shape would always be reloaded whenever its URL was changed. From now on, this will no longer be the case when the URL only had a fragment change.

Examples:

- When `#https://company.be/#/app/Map` changes to `#https://company.be/#/app/Map#urlfragment`, the browser shape will not be reloaded because the URL only had its fragment changed.

- When `#https://company.be/#/app/Map` changes to `#https://company.be/#/app/Map?embed=true#urlfragment`, the browser shape will be reloaded because the URL not only had its fragment changed but also its query parameter.

#### System Center - Database: Warning when a DataMiner Agent in the cluster is offline [ID_36184]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.6 -->

In the *Database* section of *System Center*, a warning will now appear whenever a DataMiner Agent in the cluster is offline.

Also, when you click *Save* after changing any of the settings in this *Database* section, a popup message will now appear, saying that the Agents need to be restarted for the changes to take effect.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> No warning will appear to point out that the backup Agent in a Failover setup is offline.

#### Alarm Console - Proactive cap detection: Enhanced suggestion event value for predicted minimum or maximum values [ID_36440]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.7 -->

The proactive cap detection feature generates suggestion events for predicted data range violations. The value of these suggestion events has now been changed

- from  `Predicted above range violation between ... and ...` or `Predicted below range violation between ... and ...`
- to `Predicted maximum value [x] [unit] between ... and ...` or `Predicted minimum value [x] [unit] between ... and ...`

\*[x] being the value of the maximum or minimum value of the data range for the parameter as specified in the protocol, and [unit] being the unit of the parameter as specified in the protocol.

The value of the suggestion events generated for predicted (critical) alarm threshold breaches has not been changed.

#### Errors or alarms will no longer be generated at startup when the DMS does not include an indexing engine [ID_36590]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

From now on, when the DataMiner System does not include an indexing engine, no run-time errors or alarms of type "Notice" will be generated for ServiceManager, TicketingManager, ResourceManager and ProfilesManager at startup.

Also, when you open the *Profiles*, *Resources* or *Bookings* app in Cube, a message will now appear, saying that the DataMiner System does not include an indexing engine.

#### Visual Overview: Subtract placeholder now also supports numerics [ID_36636]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.8 -->

Up to now, the subtract placeholder could be used to calculate datetime and time span values by subtracting one or more values from a specified value. From now on, this placeholder also supports numerics. Just like with datetime values and time spans, you can subtract consecutive numbers from the first number.

Examples:

- Subtracting one number from another: `[Subtract:10,3]`

- Subtracting multiple numbers from the first number: `[Subtract:10.1,3.3,2.6]`

#### Trending - Pattern matching: Enhanced error handling and performance [ID_36772]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the pattern matching functionality, especially with regard to error handling and overall performance.

#### Trending - Behavioral anomaly detection: Alarms and suggestion events will now be displayed in the language set as UI language [ID_36828] [ID_36836]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.9 -->

All alarms and suggestion events generated following the detection of behavioral anomalies will now appear in the language set as UI language.

#### Trending - Pattern matching: Loading indication around light bulb icon while loading time-scoped related parameters [ID_36831]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->

When time-scoped related parameters are being loaded in a trend graph, now the light bulb icon will be shown with rotating ring dots to indicate the ongoing loading process. Previously, the light bulb was only shown when a response had been received from the server.

#### Visual Overview: Problem when using '[property:]' placeholders in shape data fields of type 'Element' and 'View' [ID_36553]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.8 -->

Up to now, when a property was updated, `[property:]` placeholders in shape data fields of type *Element* or *View* would not always get resolved correctly. The only way to ensure a `[property:]` placeholder was resolved correctly after a property update was to close the card and open it again.

Processing of property updates has now been improved. `[property:]` placeholders will now be resolved correctly without having to close the card and open it again.

#### Trending - Pattern matching: Problem when loading multivariate pattern [ID_36863]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.10 -->
<!-- For new feature included in same RN, refer to Other new features -->

When, in a trend graph, you hovered over a pattern of which the instance of the curve was not equal to the instance of the pattern (which had its instancePartOfIdentity property set to false), the curve would incorrectly not be highlighted.

Also, incorrect curves would be added when you clicked to load the linked patterns, and incorrect curves were highlighted when you hovered over a pattern that consisted of two subpatterns from different elements.

#### Trending: Problem when editing a trend pattern on a graph other than the one on which the pattern was created [ID_37191]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.11 -->
