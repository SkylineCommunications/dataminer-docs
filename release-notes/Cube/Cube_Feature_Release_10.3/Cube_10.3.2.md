## Highlights

*No highlights have been selected for this release yet*

## Other features

#### Trending - Pattern matching: Colors will now be used to differentiate how matches were detected [ID_34898] [ID_34947]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Up to now, matches found for the same element/parameter as the one for which a tag was defined were shown in bright orange, while matches associated with tags created for another element/parameter were shown in lighter orange. From now on, those colors will be used to indicate how the matches were detected:

- Matches detected by means of the so-called *streaming method* will be shown in bright orange.

  These matches are detected while tracking for trend patterns whenever a trended parameter is updated. When such a match is detected, a suggestion event is generated.

- Matches detected by means of the so-called *non-streaming method* will be shown in lighter orange.

  These matches are detected only when trend data is fetched from the database after you opened a trend graph.

> [!NOTE]
> Only matches detected by means of the so-called *streaming method* will be stored in the database.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Trending - pattern matching: Enhanced feedback when creating a trend pattern tag failed [ID_34963]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.2 -->

Up to now, when the creation of a trend pattern tag failed, the general error message `Consider increasing or decreasing  the tag time range selection and try again.` was displayed. From now, one of the following, more detailed messages will be displayed instead:

```txt
Failed to save your tag. Consider reducing the tag time range selection and try again.

Failed to save your tag. The data covered by the tag time range selection contains too little detail. Consider increasing the tag time range selection and try again.

Failed to save your tag. A tag time range was selected for which not all trend data can be retrieved. Consider adjusting the tag time range selection and try again.

Failed to save your tag. The defined patterns cannot be linked into the multivariate pattern. Consider adjusting its configuration and try again.
```

### Fixes

#### DataMiner Cube: Latest script updates would not be shown when opening a script in the Automation app [ID_34738]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

When you opened the *Automation* app in DataMiner Cube and selected an unmodified script, the latest updates made to that script by another Cube client or another program (e.g. DataMiner Integration Studio) would not be shown. From now on, when you open a script in the Automation app that has not yet been changed in that same app, the latest version of that script will now automatically be retrieved from the server.

#### DataMiner Cube - Protocols & Templates: Function protocols would incorrectly be listed multiple times [ID_34885]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

When you opened the *Protocol & Templates* module, in some rare cases, function protocols would incorrectly be listed multiple times in the protocol list.

#### DataMiner Cube: Renaming your local DataMiner user would incorrectly cause that user to disappear [ID_34918]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU11] - FR 10.3.2 -->

When you renamed your local DataMiner user with administrative access while being logged in as that user, the user would incorrectly get (partially) removed.
