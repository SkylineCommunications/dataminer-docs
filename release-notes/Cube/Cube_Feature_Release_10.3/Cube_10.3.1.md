#### Visual Overview: Automatically generated shapes representing bookings can now be sorted by custom property [ID_34572]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU10] - FR 10.3.1 -->

When specifying that a shape should be created automatically for each booking in a particular set of bookings, it is now possible to have the automatically generated shapes sorted by a custom booking property.

For example, in an SRM environment, you can have a booking time range that includes pre-roll and post-roll, and timings that contain the custom properties *Start* and *End*. From now on, it is possible to have the automatically generated shapes sorted by one of those custom properties. To do so, you can specify a shape data field of type *ChildrenSort* to the group-level shape and set its value to `Property|<CustomProperty>,<asc/desc>`.

Examples:

```txt
ChildrenSort="Property|Start,asc"
ChildrenSort="Property|End,desc"
```
