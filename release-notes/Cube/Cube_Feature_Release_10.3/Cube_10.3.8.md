## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Visual Overview: TextWrapping should now default to the correct value "Wrap" [ID_36363]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

When a shape did not have a *TextStyle* shape data field, up to now, the *TextWrapping* option would automatically be set to "WrapWithOverflow".

From now on, when a shape does not have a *TextStyle* shape data field, the *TextWrapping* option will automatically be set to "Wrap" instead.

### Fixes

#### Visual Overview: Problem with element or view scope of Children shapes [ID_36354]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU17]/10.3.0 [CU5] - FR 10.3.8 -->

In some cases, when a placeholder was used in the *Element* or *View* shape data field of a *Children* shape, the scope would not be updated when changes were made to the placeholder.

From now on, the scope will be updated correctly whenever changes are made to the placeholder in the *Element* or *View* shape data field.
