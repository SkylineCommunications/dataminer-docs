## Other features

#### Visual Overview - ListView: Copying list data to the Windows clipboard [ID_35170]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

The ListView component now allows you to copy data from the list to the Windows clipboard.

To copy the contents of one or more rows:

1. Select the row(s).
1. Choose *Copy selected row(s)*.

To copy the contents of a single cell:

1. Right-click in the cell.
1. Choose *Copy \<cell contents\>*.

The data copied to the Windows clipboard is split into a header section and a data section, separated by an empty line. The header section contains the column names, while the data section contains the actual row data.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Only the columns that are visible to the user will be copied to the Windows clipboard. Also, the order of the columns will be identical to the order of the columns in the ListView component. Note that column visibility and column order can be configured using the component's column manager.
> - When you copy one or more rows, only cells that contain text will be included. For example, cells that only contain a colored rectangle will not be included. Also, when you try to copy the contents of a single cell, the *Copy \<cell contents\>* command will only be available if that cell contains text.

#### System Center: New DataMiner log file 'SLSmartBaselineManager.txt' [ID_35352]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

In the *Logging* section of *System Center*, you can now also consult the *SLSmartBaselineManager.txt* log file.

#### Automation: New user/group setting to specify whether users have to confirm program executions launched from interactive Automation scripts [ID_35418]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

A new user/group setting named *Do not confirm program executions from scripts*, found in the *User > Cube* tab of the *Settings* window, now allows you to specify whether users will have to explicitly confirm each program execution that is launched from an interactive Automation script.

By default, this option will be disabled, meaning that users will have to give their consent each time an interactive Automation script wants to launch a program. The confirmation box will also allow users to change the setting by selecting the *Don't show this confirmation again. Always launch program executions.* check box.

Each time a program is launched, a start entry and an end entry will be added to the Cube logging as well as to the *SLClient.txt* log file on the DataMiner Agent.

- The start entry will contain the following data:

  - the name of the Automation script
  - the ID of the Automation script
  - the user's login data (full name, client machine name, client app name and last login date)
  - the program that will be launched
  - the arguments that will be passed to the program (if any)

- The end entry will contain the following data:

  - the user's login data (full name, client machine name, client app name and last login date)
  - the process ID of the program
  - the time at which the process ended
  - the name of the program that ended
  - the arguments that were passed to the program (if any)

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Elasticsearch: 'Request Entity Too Large (413)' errors will now be prevented when writing data in bulk [ID_34937]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

When data was written to Elasticsearch in bulk, up to now, DataMiner would throw a `Request Entity Too Large (413)` error when the amount of data exceeded the 100 MB limit.

From now on, DataMiner will detect when too much data is being sent in a single request and will split up the data into smaller parts.

#### DataMiner Cube will now immediately be aware of any changes as to the availability of Cassandra or Elasticsearch [ID_35209]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

Up to now, Cube would only check at startup whether Cassandra or Elasticsearch were available. From now on, it will immediately be aware of any changes as to the availability of Cassandra or Elasticsearch.

#### Visual Overview: Leading spaces removed from port information fields [ID_35334]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

Leading spaces have been removed from the following port information fields:

- BusAddress
- ElementTimeoutTime
- NrOfRetries
- PollingIP
- SlowPoll
- TimeoutTime

#### EPM: Data retrieved from the collector that was displayed as a table with a single row will now be displayed as single parameters [ID_35371]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

In an EPM card, in some cases, data retrieved from the collector was displayed as a table with a single row, which often had the system name as primary key.

From now on, data retrieved from the collector that used to be displayed as a table with a single row will now be displayed as single parameters (one for every column).

#### Trending - Pattern matching: A slightly larger number of missing values will now be allowed when you create a trend pattern tag [ID_35376]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

When you try to create a trend pattern tag, an error message will appear when there are too many missing values in the selected pattern.

From now on, a slightly larger number of missing values will be allowed will you create a trend pattern tag.

### Fixes

#### DataMiner Cube - ListView component: Problem with custom property columns and date columns [ID_35218]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

When, in an *ListView* component, you hovered over a cell value in a custom property column or a date column, no tooltip would appear.

Also, the filter box above a custom property column would incorrectly always be empty.

#### Alarm Console: Multiple values in property columns would incorrectly not be separated by any separator [ID_35239]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

If, in the Alarm Console, property columns are added for service or view properties, and an alarm affects more than one service or view, this can result in property columns containing multiple property values.

In the *PropertyConfiguration.xml* file, for each relevant property you can configure a *contentSeparator* tag. The separator specified in that tag will then be used to separate the values of that property.

Up to now, when a *contentSeparator* tag was left empty, the values of the property in question would incorrect not be separated by any separator. From now on, when that tag is empty, the values of the property in question will by default be separated by commas.

#### Trending: Problem when exporting a trend graph containing average trend data [ID_35290]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

When you exported a trend graph containing average trend data to CSV, in some cases, the exported data would be parsed incorrectly.

#### ListView component: Column filter boxes incorrectly had autocomplete enabled [ID_35296]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

In a *ListView* component, you can click the filter icon of a particular column and enter a filter in the box below the column header.

Up to now, those column filter boxes incorrectly had *autocomplete* enabled.

#### Visual Overview: Problem after filtering bookings using a custom time range in ListView component or Resource Manager component [ID_35328]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

When, in a ListView component or a Resource Manager component showing a bookings timeline, you had filtered the bookings using a custom time range, performance issues could start to occur after a period of time.

#### Visual Overview: Problem when editing a discrete parameter with a 'Sequence' tag displayed in a lite parameter control [ID_35356]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

When a discrete parameter with a `<Sequence>` tag was displayed in a lite parameter control, its current value would neither be displayed nor selected while being edited.

#### Data Display: Problem with the alarm bubble-up feature in a tree control containing many-to-many relationships [ID_35367]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

When a tree control contained many-to-many relationships, up to now, the alarm bubble-up feature would not work correctly.

#### Trending: Pattern matching tags could incorrectly be defined for discrete or string parameters [ID_35368]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

Pattern matching does not support discrete or string parameters. However, up to now, when viewing a trend graph that showed trend information for either a discrete or a string parameter, it would incorrectly be possible to define tags for pattern matching. From now on, this will no longer be possible.

#### Trending: Tag icon was displayed after you selected a section of a trend graph even though it was not possible to define tags [ID_35378] [ID_35383]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

In some cases, when the pattern matching feature was not enabled in *System Center* > *System settings* > *analytics config*, the tag icon was displayed after you selected a section of a trend graph even though it was not actually possible to define tags.

From now on, Cube will check whether the pattern matching feature is enabled each time you open a trend graph.

#### Data Display: Problem with the alarm bubble-up feature in a tree control containing EPM objects [ID_35396]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

When a tree control contained EPM objects, in some cases, the alarm bubble-up feature would not work correctly.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum analysis: Presets would not be loaded when opening a spectrum element while connected to a heavily loaded DMA [ID_35421]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

When you opened a spectrum element in a DataMiner Cube that was connected to a heavily loaded DataMiner Agent, the presets would not be loaded.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Problem when filtering bookings in a ListView component [ID_35430]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.3.3 -->

When, in Visual Overview, a filter was applied to a *ListView* component that listed bookings, no account would be taken of bookings added after the filter had been applied. As a result, in some cases, the *ListView* component would list bookings that did not match the filter.

#### DataMiner Cube - DCF: Problem when trying to delete a DCF connection in the Properties window of an element [ID_35449]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

When you tried to remove a DCF connection in the *Properties* window of an element, an exception would be thrown and the connection would not be removed when the destination element was stopped or paused.

#### Visual Overview: Problem when re-arranging dynamically positioned shapes [ID_35462]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU12] - FR 10.3.3 -->

When, in a Visio drawing, shapes have been positioned dynamically, you can re-arrange those shapes manually by switching to *Arrange* mode and re-arranging the shapes using drag-and-drop. In some cases, after you had re-arranged a number of shapes, a *NullReferenceException* could be thrown.
