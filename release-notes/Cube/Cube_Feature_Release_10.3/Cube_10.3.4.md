### Fixes

#### Visual Overview: Problem with EnableFollowMode option of Resource Manager timeline [ID_35528]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you had specified the *EnableFollowMode* option in the *ComponentOptions* shape data field of a shape configured to display the Resource Manager timeline, in some cases, that option would incorrectly be disabled.

From now on, when you activate the follow mode by specifying the *EnableFollowMode* option, the timeline will move along with the current time. When you navigate away from the line that represents now while follow mode is enabled, follow mode will temporarily be paused. As soon as you navigate back in view of the line that represents now, follow mode will be activated again.

#### DataMiner Cube - Search box: Problem when loading templates after right-clicking an element and selecting 'Assign alarm template' or 'Assign trend template' [ID_35582]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When, in the search box in the middle of the Cube header bar, you enter the name of an element and right-click the suggested element, a context menu will open identical to that which opens when you click an element in the Surveyor.

However, when, in that context menu, you then selected *Protocols & Templates > Assign alarm template* or *Protocols & Templates > Assign trend template*, the available templates would not get loaded.

#### DataMiner Cube: Problem when receiving a notification from SLAnalytics while in alarm storm mode [ID_35596]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

An error could occur in DataMiner Cube when it received a notification from SLAnalytics while in alarm storm mode.

Also, from now on, DataMiner Cube will no longer group incident alarms into summary alarms while in alarm storm mode.

#### DataMiner Cube: Pattern edit menu would incorrectly open when you resized the selected area in a trend graph [ID_35627]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you resized the selected area in a trend graph, the pattern edit menu would incorrectly open, even when you were not allowed to create a pattern or when you had no intention of editing a pattern.
