## Changes

### Enhancements

#### System Center: Database setting "CloudStorage" renamed to "STaaS" [ID_38325]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

In the *Database* section of *System Center*, up to now, when a DataMiner Agent was configured to use Storage as a Service (STaaS), the *Database* setting was set to "CloudStorage". This "CloudStorage" value has now been renamed to "STaaS".

Also, when *Database* is set to "STaaS", the *Configuration* and *Maintenance* sections will no longer be visible in both the *General* and *Offload* tabs, and the *Cassandra preparation/migration* button will be hidden.

### Fixes

#### No longer allowed to create properties with a name that consists of whitespace characters only [ID_38209]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

Up to now, DataMiner Cube would incorrectly allow you to create properties of which the name consisted of whitespace characters only. From now on, this is no longer allowed.

#### Problem when opening a service card of which the default page was set to 'Reports' [ID_38380]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

When you opened a service card of which the default page was set to *Reports*, an error could occur, causing DataMiner Cube to become unresponsive.
