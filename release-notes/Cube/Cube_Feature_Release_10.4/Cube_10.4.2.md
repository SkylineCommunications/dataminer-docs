### Enhancements

#### Optimization of memory handling when closing cards [ID_37858]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

Overall memory handling when closing cards has been optimized.

### Fixes

#### Problem when adding up [Start Time:] placeholders [ID_37661]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When the [Sum:] placeholder was used to add [Start Time:] placeholders, in some cases, the sum would not be correct.

From now on, when configuring [Start Time:] placeholders that will be used in Sum operations, a format will have to be specified.

#### Problem when right-clicking after selecting a large number of elements and/or services in a view card [ID_37981]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When, in a view card, you selected a large number of elements and/or services and then right-clicked, in some cases, Cube could become unresponsive.

#### DataMiner Cube - Correlation: Problem with 'Dynamic' option in 'Send email' action [ID_37995]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When configuring a Correlation rule, you can make that rule send an email by adding a *Send email* action to it.

In some cases, when you opened a *Send email* action, it would incorrectly not be possible to select the *Dynamic* option to indicate that the elements that triggered the Correlation rule have to be included.
