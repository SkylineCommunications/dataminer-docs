### Enhancements

#### SLAnalytics: Number of 'GetParameterMessages' requests has been optimized [ID 34936]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.1 -->

The number of *GetParameterMessages* sent by SLAnalytics in order to check whether a trended table parameter is still active has been optimized.

#### ListView component: Rows with an identical value will additionally be sorted by Name [ID 35500]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When, in a ListView component, you sort the rows by clicking a particular column header, from now on, all rows with an identical value in the column you sorted by will additionally be sorted by the *Name* column (in ascending order).

#### Bookings app: Default window of timeline area now set to '-8 hours <NOW> +16 hours' [ID 35525]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

In the *Bookings* app, the default window of the timeline area has now been changed from `-1 day <NOW> +1 day` to `-8 hours <NOW> +16 hours`.

This also means that a ListView component configured to list bookings will by default have its *StartTime=* and *EndTime=* options set to `NOW - 8 hours` and `NOW + 16 hours` respectively.

#### Selecting 'Help' will now open the 'Getting started' page of the online DataMiner documentation [ID 35571]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When, in DataMiner Cube, you select *Help* in the user menu or the *Apps* pane, the ['Getting started' page of the online DataMiner documentation](xref:Getting_Started) will open in a browser window.

#### Services app: Enhanced performance when opening the 'Profiles' tab [ID 35634]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

Because of a number of enhancements made with regard to the retrieval of overrides for parameter values, overall performance has increased when opening the *Profiles* tab of the *Services* app.

#### System Center - Agents: Clearer restart warning before an upgrade is started [ID 35687]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you tried to upgrade an agent in System Center, up to now, the following general message would appear:

`Updating DataMiner requires a restart of the DataMiner Agent`

This message has now been changed to provide more details:

`Updating DataMiner using a full upgrade package requires a restart of the DataMiner Agent. A web upgrade package will only restart the web server.`

### Fixes

#### Trending: Pattern matching tags could incorrectly be defined for discrete or string parameters [ID 35368]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

Pattern matching does not support discrete or string parameters. However, up to now, when viewing a trend graph that showed trend information for either a discrete or a string parameter, it would incorrectly be possible to define tags for pattern matching. From now on, this will no longer be possible.

#### Trending: Tag icon was displayed after you selected a section of a trend graph even though it was not possible to define tags [ID 35378] [ID 35383]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

In some cases, when the pattern matching feature was not enabled in *System Center* > *System settings* > *analytics config*, the tag icon was displayed after you selected a section of a trend graph even though it was not actually possible to define tags.

From now on, Cube will check whether the pattern matching feature is enabled each time you open a trend graph.

#### Problem with SLElement when stopping an EPM element [ID 35439]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 -->

When an EPM element was stopped, in some rare cases, an error could occur in SLElement.

#### Bookings app: Initial time window was incorrect [ID 35527]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you open the *Bookings* app, Cube adds a small offset to the time window when it requests the list of bookings from the server. Up to now, instead of subtracting 1 minute from the start time, it would incorrectly add 1 minute to it. When the initial time window was e.g. 11h00 to 12h00, it would incorrectly request the bookings from 11h01 to 12h01 instead of from 10h59 to 12h01.

Also, in some cases, the "loading" indicator of the bookings timeline would incorrectly not disappear when all bookings were loaded.

#### Visual Overview: Problem with EnableFollowMode option of Resource Manager timeline [ID 35528]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you had specified the *EnableFollowMode* option in the *ComponentOptions* shape data field of a shape configured to display the Resource Manager timeline, in some cases, that option would incorrectly be disabled.

From now on, when you activate the follow mode by specifying the *EnableFollowMode* option, the timeline will move along with the current time. When you navigate away from the line that represents now while follow mode is enabled, follow mode will temporarily be paused. As soon as you navigate back in view of the line that represents now, follow mode will be activated again.

#### DataMiner Cube - Search box: Problem when loading templates after right-clicking an element and selecting 'Assign alarm template' or 'Assign trend template' [ID 35582]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When, in the search box in the middle of the Cube header bar, you enter the name of an element and right-click the suggested element, a context menu will open identical to that which opens when you click an element in the Surveyor.

However, when, in that context menu, you then selected *Protocols & Templates > Assign alarm template* or *Protocols & Templates > Assign trend template*, the available templates would not get loaded.

#### DataMiner Cube: Full user name would incorrectly no longer be displayed at the top of the user menu [ID 35584]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When, in DataMiner Cube, you clicked the user icon in the top-right corner, the full user name would incorrectly no longer be displayed at the top of the user menu.

#### DataMiner Cube: Problem when receiving a notification from SLAnalytics while in alarm storm mode [ID 35596]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

An error could occur in DataMiner Cube when it received a notification from SLAnalytics while in alarm storm mode.

Also, from now on, DataMiner Cube will no longer group incident alarms into summary alarms while in alarm storm mode.

#### EPM: Number of alarms would incorrectly not be indicated in the navigation pane of an EPM card [ID 35604]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you open the card of an element, a view or a service, in the navigation pane on the left, the number of alarms is indicated next to the name of the ALARMS section. Up to now, this was not the case when you opened the card of an EPM object. From now on, the number of alarms that affect the EPM object in question will be indicated next to the name of the ALARMS section.

#### Resources app: Problem when moving a resource from one resource pool to another [ID 35612]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When, in the *Resources* app, you moved a resource from one resource pool to another, in some cases, the resource would have missing data after being moved.

#### DataMiner Cube: Pattern edit menu would incorrectly open when you resized the selected area in a trend graph [ID 35627]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you resized the selected area in a trend graph by dragging either the left or right selection boundary, the pattern edit menu would incorrectly open, even when you were not allowed to create a pattern or when you had no intention of editing a pattern.

#### DataMiner Cube - Trending: Problem with Y axis alarm coloring [ID 35633]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.3 [CU1] -->
<!-- Incorrect FR - not added to 10.3.3 [CU1] -->

When a parameter with a relative alarm threshold had its baseline set to a negative value, in the trend graph of that parameter, the alarm coloring on the Y axis could be incorrect.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Problem when a session variable was used in an alarm filter [ID 35681]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When you applied a filter to an alarm tab, no alarms would be shown when you had used a session variable in the filter.

#### DataMiner Cube: Exception values with decimals would be displayed incorrectly in trend graph [ID 35714]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

Because DataMiner Cube would use the incorrect culture when parsing exception values, in some cases, exception values with decimals would be displayed incorrectly in trend graphs.

#### DataMiner Cube - Asset Manager app: Enum fields would not immediately be updated after clicking 'Apply' [ID 35747]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU13]/10.3.0 [CU1] - FR 10.3.4 -->

When, in the *Asset Manager* app, you tried to update an enum field, the value would not immediately be updated in the UI after clicking *Apply*.
