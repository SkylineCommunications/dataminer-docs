#### System Center: Overhaul of LDAP settings [ID_35782]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.6 -->

In *System Center > System settings > LDAP*, you can configure a number of LDAP settings. These settings have had an overhaul.

- In the *General* tab, from now on, you will only be able to set *Authentication type* to either "Anonymous" or "Simple".

  > [!NOTE]
  > When you set *Authentication type* to "Anonymous", the *User name* and *Password* fields will now be disabled. When both fields contain a value, *Authentication type* will by default be set to "Simple".

- In this section, it is now also possible to configure the *nonDomainLDAP* setting. Up to now, this setting could only be configured in the *DataMiner.xml* file.

- When you update LDAP settings, a warning will now appear to notify you that these settings will only be changed on the DataMiner Agent to which you are connected. Changes made to LDAP settings will not be synchronized among the agents in the cluster.

Also, a number of issues have been fixed. Up to now, the value entered in *Use fully qualified domain name (FQDN)* would not be saved to the *DataMiner.xml* file, an incorrect default value would be entered in the *User class name* field, and the value entered in the *Password* field would get lost when the LDAP settings were updated without changing the password.

#### Services app - Profiles tab: Profile instance selection box now sorted by name [ID_36332]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

When, in the *Services* app, you configure a service profile instance in the *Profiles* tab, you can link the different nodes of the service profile to existing profile instances using a profile instance selection box. Up to now, the profile instances listed in this selection box were sorted the creation date. From now on, they will be sorted by name. Also, this selection box can now be filtered.

#### Resources app: Saving a resource property with an empty value [ID_36345]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

In the *Resources* app, it is now possible to save a resource property with an empty value.

### Fixes

#### DataMiner Cube - Resources app: Problem when opening the element list in the 'device' tab [ID_36239]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

When, in the *Resources* app, you created a resource and then opened the element list in the *device* tab in order to link a device to that newly created resource, in some cases, DataMiner Cube could become unresponsive, especially when the element list contained a large number of elements.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Problem when opening an EPM card [ID_36323]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

When you opened an EPM card by clicking a shape that was linked to the EPM object via the *SystemName* and *SystemType* properties, in some cases, the card would be missing certain pages.
