### Fixes

#### DataMiner Cube: Report or dashboard would not be selected after 'Email', 'Upload to FTP' or 'Upload to shared folder' action was initialized [ID_36631]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

In *Automation*, *Correlation* and *Scheduler*, you can select a report of a dashboard in an *Email*, *Upload to FTP* or *Upload to shared folder* action. When such an action was initialized, in some rare cases, the report or dashboard would not be automatically selected.

#### DataMiner Cube - Trending: Panning across the graph would not work [ID_36769]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU18]/10.3.0 [CU6] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When you opened a trend graph showing trend data of a parameter that only had average trending enabled, in some cases, it would not be possible to pan across the graph.
