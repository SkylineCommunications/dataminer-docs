### Enhancements

#### System Center: Enhancements made to Database > Offload section [ID_36037]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

In *System Center*, a few enhancements have been made to the *Database > Offload* section:

- When you set *Type* to "Database", select *Trend data* in the *Offloads* section, and set the frequency under *Enable data offload* to "permanently", the time indication (e.g "starting every day at") will no longer be shown.

- When you set *Type* to "Database" and select *Parameter value* in the *Offloads* section, from now on, you will no longer be able to set the frequency under *Enable snapshot offload* to "permanently".

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > If, before upgrading to this DataMiner version, *Parameter value* was selected and the frequency was set to "permanently", *Parameter value* will no longer be selected after upgrading. As a result, no snapshot will be offloaded until you reconfigure the snapshot offload settings.

### Fixes

#### EPM: KPI histogram would incorrectly not be shown [ID_36004]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU15]/10.3.0 [CU3] - FR 10.3.6 -->

When, in a topology chain, you opened a KPI window and clicked the histogram icon, in some cases, the histogram window would be empty.
