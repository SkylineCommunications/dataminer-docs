# DataMiner Cube Feature Release 10.2.12

> [!NOTE]
> For known issues with this version, refer to [Known issues](xref:Known_issues).

> [!TIP]
> For release notes for this release that are not related to DataMiner Cube, see [General Feature Release 10.2.12](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.2.12).

## Highlights

#### Trending: Light bulb icon now indicates that related parameters have been found [ID_34432]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

In the top-right corner of a trend graph, next to the full-screen button, a light bulb icon will now appear when DataMiner finds parameters that are related to the parameters shown in the trend graph. Clicking this light bulb icon will allow you to add one or more of those related parameters to the trend graph you are viewing.

Relationships between parameters are found by studying the changes in the behavior of a trend (also known as change points). These relationships are then stored in a model managed by a DataMiner Extension Module named *ModelHost*. When you open a trend graph, DataMiner Cube will consult the ModelHost Extension Module to retrieve from it all parameters related to those shown in the trend graph, and list the ten most important ones when you click the light bulb icon.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - This light bulb feature will only work on cloud-connected DataMiner Agents that have the *ModelHost* DxM installed and that have been configured to [offload alarm and change point events to the cloud](xref:Controlling_cloudfeed_data_offloads).
> - Relationship models are calculated once per week. When this feature is activated, it can take up to a week before the first results are visible.

#### Automation: No more 'Abort' buttons in dialog boxes of interactive Automation scripts [ID_34559]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

In dialog boxes of an interactive Automation script, up to now, you were able to abort the script by clicking the *Abort* button. From now on, this button will no longer be available. Instead, you can now do the following to abort a script when a dialog box has the focus:

- close the dialog box by clicking the *X* in the top-right corner, or

- press ALT+F4.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When an interactive Automation script was launched from a web app, then you will have to press ESC instead of ALT+F4 to close a dialog box and abort the script. Pressing ALT+F4 would close the browser, not just the dialog box.

## Other features

#### Visual Overview - ListView component : Custom property columns 'Reservation.Start' and 'Reservation.End' can now be configured to convert date/time values to the time zone specified in the navigation panel of the bookings timeline [ID_34512]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

Up to now, when you added the custom property columns *Reservation.Start* and *Reservation.End* to a ListView component configured to list bookings, the UTC date/time values in those columns would always be converted to the time zone of the DataMiner Agent. From now on, if you set the type of those columns to "Date InvariantCulture", the date/time values in those columns will be converted to the time zone specified in the navigation panel of the bookings timeline.

#### Server-side search: New option 'includeAllCustomProperties' [ID_34541]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

In the *MaintenanceSettings.xml* file, you can configure the DataMiner Cube server-side search engine by specifying one or more search options in the *SLNet.SearchOptions* element.

If you specify the new *includeAllCustomProperties* option, the server-side search engine will now search the values of all custom properties. Up to now, the search engine would by default only search the values of the custom properties that were displayed in the Surveyor.

For more information on the available search options, see [Setting the indexing options for the server-side search](xref:Setting_the_indexing_options_for_the_server-side_search).

Also, from now on, DataMiner Cube will call the server-side search engine when you enter a numeric search string like "1234". Up to now, when you entered a numeric search string, DataMiner Cube would perform a client-side search that would only return views of which the ID matched the search string.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Visual Overview: New toggle buttons added to Buttons stencil [ID_34426]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 [CU0] -->

The Buttons stencil now contains the following additional buttons:

- *tb-var-l* (button on left side, text on right side, logic based on session variable, configurable session variable scope)
- *tb-var-r* (button on right side, text on left side, logic based on session variable, configurable session variable scope)

Other changes made to the Buttons stencil:

- Buttons *abtn-automation* and *lbtn-automation* have been combined into one button *btn-automation*.
- Button *btn-popup* now has configurable window settings.

#### Trending - Behavioral anomaly detection: Enhanced detection of flatline changes [ID_34487]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->
<!-- Not added to 10.3.0 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall accuracy when detecting flatline changes has increased, especially in the following cases:

- When an element becomes inactive or is paused.
- When an element is deleted.
- When a table parameter is no longer active.

Any alarm or suggestion events created for flatline changes will now close sooner when one of the above-mentioned situations occurs.

#### Trending - Behavioral anomaly detection: Enhanced updating of anomaly alarms after alarm template changes [ID_34543]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, anomaly alarms will now be updated even more quickly after an alarm template change.

For example, if the monitoring of a certain type of anomaly (flatline, level shift, variance, trend) stops because of an alarm template change, every open alarm for that type of anomaly will now be cleared.

Changes that might result in anomaly alarms of a certain type being cleared:

- Assigning a new alarm template that does not monitor this type of anomaly.

- Removing an alarm template, causing this type of anomaly to no longer be monitored.

- Editing an alarm template in such a way that this type of anomaly is no longer monitored.

- Changing the template filter so that it is no longer applicable to the parameter in question.

> [!NOTE]
> When an alarm template that had already been assigned to an element earlier is changed in such a way that monitoring of a certain type of anomaly is started, or when it is replaced by another alarm template that causes the monitoring of a certain type of anomaly to start, then every open suggestion event for that type of anomaly associated with the element in question will be promoted to an alarm event.

#### System Center: Link to online help now points to 'Connecting your DataMiner System to the cloud' on <https://docs.dataminer.services/> [ID_34683]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

On the *Cloud* page of *System Center*, the *online help* hyperlink now points to the [Connecting your DataMiner System to the cloud](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud) page on <https://docs.dataminer.services/>.

#### Alarm Console: When grouped, incident alarms will now appear in the group of the highest severity found among the base alarms [ID_34754]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

When you open an alarm tab that contains incident alarms, the icons in front of those incident alarms show the highest severity found among the base alarms and the severity column shows "suggestion".

Up to now, when you grouped/sorted the alarms in the alarm tab by severity, the incident alarms would all appear in the "suggestion" group. From now on, they will instead appear in the group of the highest severity found among the base alarms.

Also, in case of incident alarms, the alarm duration indicator will now show the highest severity found among the base alarms.

### Fixes

#### DataMiner Cube - Trending: Y axis of trend graph would incorrectly show duplicate values [ID_34492]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When a trend graph showed a constant value, due to a rounding issue, the Y axis would incorrectly show duplicate values.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum Analysis: Problem with measurement point option 'Invert spectrum' [ID_34552]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When you had selected the *Invert spectrum* option while configuring a measurement point, in some cases, that option would incorrectly not be applied.

#### DataMiner Cube - Data Display: Parameter controls displaying a write parameter of type DateTime would incorrectly not take into account the format of the current culture as defined in the regional settings of DataMiner Cube [ID_34575]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

A parameter control displaying a write parameter of type DateTime would incorrectly not take into account the format of the current culture as defined in the regional settings of DataMiner Cube. As a result, the read and write parameters would be formatted differently.

#### Trending: Problem when duplicating table parameters with different values [ID_34591]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When duplicating a table parameter in the legend of a trend graph, the graph would not be displayed if the duplicate parameter did not have the same index value as the original parameter.

#### Trending: Table would be cleared of all data after refreshing [ID_34592]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When triggering a refresh of a trend chart, the data and axes on the line chart would disappear for a short period of time without first verifying whether there was any new incoming data. If the incoming data equals null, the graph should not be redrawn and should remain visible.

#### Visual Overview: Dynamically generated shapes sorted by custom property value would not be displayed in the correct order [ID_34617]

<!-- MR 10.1.0 [CU21] / 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When a large number of shapes generated based on child items in a view were sorted by a custom property value, in some rare cases, those shapes would not be displayed in the correct order.

#### Visual Overview: Problem when loading a DCF signal path [ID_34630]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

When a visual overview was configured to display a DCF signal path, in some cases, that signal path would not load.

Also, in some cases, elements with an index in a service would incorrectly not show connection lines.

#### Trending - Pattern matching: Not all detected pattern occurrences would be indicated when you opened a trend graph [ID_34671]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->

When you opened a trend graph that contained patterns matching existing tags, in some cases, not all detected occurrences of those patterns would initially be indicated. Only after zooming out would all detected patterns be properly indicated.

#### Alarm Console - Incident tracking: Alarms without focus data would not be disposed of when their parent group was cleared [ID_34713]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 - FR 10.2.12 -->
<!-- Not added to 10.3.0 -->

Alarms without focus data would incorrectly not be disposed of when their parent group was cleared.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Problem with visibility of correlation alarms in filtered alarm tabs [ID_34728]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When a filtered alarm tab contained a correlation alarm, in some cases, this correlation alarm would incorrectly not disappear when it did no longer match the filter, especially when that filter was configured to hide alarms of type "Comment added", "Acknowledged" or "Released".

Also, when a correlation alarm did not match the filter, only the base alarms would be shown, but when the type of one of those base alarms changed to "Comment added", "Acknowledged" or "Released", that base alarm would incorrectly not disappear.

#### DataMiner Cube - Trending: Double-clicking a suggestion or alarm event created by SLAnalytics would open a trend graph showing "no data" [ID_34751]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU9] - FR 10.2.12 -->

When, in the Alarm Console, you double-clicked a suggestion or alarm event created by SLAnalytics for a table parameter with advanced naming, in some cases, the trend graph would incorrectly show "no data".
