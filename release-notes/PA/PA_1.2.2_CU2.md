## Fixes

#### LSO script not executed if multiple resources used same resource pool \[ID_30229\]

If multiple resources used the same resource pool, it could occur that the LSO script could not be executed. This problem has been resolved. In addition, the message that is displayed when the property "ProcessAutomation" with value "True" does not exist in the resource pool has been adjusted to provide more information.
