# DataMiner Analytics tutorials

DataMiner Analytics, also known as [DataMiner Augmented Operations](xref:Stack_Augmented_Operations), leverages state-of-the-art big data and artificial intelligence technology for several features, including [behavioral anomaly detection](xref:Behavioral_anomaly_detection), [automatic alarm grouping](xref:Automatic_incident_tracking), and more.
