# Dashboards and Low-Code Apps tutorials

This page provides an overview of all Dashboards and Low-Code Apps tutorials, organized by difficulty level. [Beginner tutorials](#beginner-tutorials) cover fundamental concepts, while [advanced tutorials](#advanced-tutorials) address more complex use cases.

> [!NOTE]
> Most tutorials created for the Dashboards app also apply to Low-Code Apps, as the functionality of these modules overlaps. Components that can be used in a dashboard can usually be used in exactly the same way in a low-code app. Consequently, it can occur that a low-code app is used as an example within a Dashboards tutorial.
