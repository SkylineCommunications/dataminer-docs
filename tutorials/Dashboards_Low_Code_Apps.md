# Dashboards and Low-Code Apps tutorials

### Dashboards tutorials

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the content in the Dashboards tutorials also applies for Low-Code Apps, as the functionality of these modules overlaps. Components that can be used in a dashboard can usually be used in exactly the same way in a low-code app. Consequently, it can occur that a low-code app is used as an example within a Dashboards tutorial.
