# Making a larger contribution

**Check with the [Skyline documentation team](mailto:team.technical.writing@skyline.be) before you use this procedure.** This way you can avoid unnecessary work, e.g. because the information you want to add is already available elsewhere in the documentation. If you are unsure of how to fit your information in the current structure of the documentation, or if you do not feel comfortable working in [Markdown](xref:CTB_Markdown_Syntax), **you can always submit your contribution by emailing it to <team.technical.writing@skyline.be> instead**.
