On every page of the documentation on docs.dataminer.services, an *Improve this page* link is available in the top-right corner. Clicking this link will open the source of the documentation on GitHub. You can then make changes as follows:

![Improve this page link](~/images/Improve_this_page.png)

1. Make sure you are logged in to GitHub.

   If you do not have a GitHub account yet, you can quickly make one via the *Sign up* button in the top-right corner.

1. On the page you intend to edit in GitHub, click the pencil button in the top-right corner.

   ![Pencil button](~/images/Contrib_PencilButton.png)

   This will create a "fork" of the documentation, i.e., a copy where you can freely make changes.

1. Make your changes using the web editor.

   To get a preview of the changes, go to the *Preview* tab.

1. Once you have made your changes, click *Commit changes* in the top-right corner.

   ![Commit changes](~/images/Commit_Changes.png)

   This will open a pop-up window.

1. In the pop-up window, you can enter a title and description for your changes and click *Propose changes*. For example:

   ![Proposing changes](~/images/Contrib_ProposeChanges.png)

   A page will then be displayed with a summary of your changes.

1. Click the green *Create pull request* button.

   A "pull request" is a request to pull changes into the repository.

   ![Create a pull request for your changes](~/images/Contrib_FirstCreatePullRequestButton.png)

1. Double-check the title and description for the pull request, and modify them if necessary.

   We recommend that you keep the option *Allow edits by maintainers* selected, so that the documentation team will be able to correct any small issues (e.g., typos) directly.

   ![Create a pull request for your changes](~/images/Contrib_CreatePullRequestForChanges.png)

1. Click *Create pull request*.

   The documentation team will review the request and merge it if it is approved. If changes are needed before it can be merged, you will receive feedback.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Do not forget to create a pull request! Otherwise, your changes may be lost.
