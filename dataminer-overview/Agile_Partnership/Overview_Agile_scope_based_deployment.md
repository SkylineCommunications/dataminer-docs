# Agile Scope Based Deployment

An agile partnership needs to detail the deployment methodology. The overview below indicates the most important topics of "agile scope-based" deployment: principles, phases, and a high-level overview.

## Principles

- Flexible scope

- Fixed agreed time frame

- Fixed agreed budget

- High-level requirements, well-defined goals, and objectives

- Focus on individuals and interactions with constraints on time available

- Continuously evolving high-level documentation and maximum focus on working software

- Collaboration-driven towards an agreed, well-defined goal within a set time frame

- Working towards the goal, with the flexibility to easily respond to change, with time constraints in mind.

## Phases

- Offering

- Definition of goals and ambitions

- Setup of the preliminary solution backlog

- Continuous delivery of smaller incremental packages

## High-level Overview

The Agile Scope-Based project methodology is most suitable for projects with **well-defined goals and objectives** (i.e. high-level requirements) but which at the same time also still have **many unknown factors**, both from user expectation and technical implementation perspective (e.g. ambiguous requirements, no well-defined exact user expectations, unknown technical dependencies, etc.). At the same time, it fits with any projects that have the ambition to put the best possible DataMiner solution in place within a **fixed time frame and a well-defined fixed budget**, which will effectively but also reasonably live up to the expectations defined in the goals and high-level requirements.

This methodology is comparable to the typical agile approach of an ICT software development or ICT integration project, but with a fixed pre-defined budget and implementation time span that all parties aim to comply with. The methodology **embraces change where necessary** to deal with the unknown as efficiently and continuously as possible. As such, it for example does not rely on rigid formal Change Request procedures. The Project Squad, consisting of both Skyline experts and user representatives, applies the agile methodologies and mindset to the maximum extent and leverages continuous feedback from and interaction with the end users to continuously deliver maximum value for minimum effort, in order to deliver the best possible solution by the anticipated end date of the project and within the budget allocated.

All involved parties also understand and acknowledge that it is impossible to expect the effective delivery of all possible imaginable features and capabilities that could be envisioned by all individuals directly and indirectly involved in the project or that could be derived from the initial goals and high-level requirements within the expected time frame and budget. Nevertheless, they trust that they can **deliver maximum value** within those time and budget boundaries and that the **solution will fully comply with the overall goals and high-level requirements** defined.
