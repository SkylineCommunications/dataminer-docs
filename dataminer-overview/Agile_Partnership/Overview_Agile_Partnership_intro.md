# Agile partnership

Skyline Communications aims to create an agile partnership with its users. Agile needs to be a **mindset shared by the entire team** with respect to how a project is successfully managed and executed.

This section provides a brief overview of the [principles](xref:Overview_Agile_Partnership_principles) and [how we deliver value together with you](xref:Overview_Agile_Partnership_delivering_value). It also introduces the [Agile scope-based methodology](xref:Overview_Agile_Partnership_scope_based_deployment), as we believe this is to be preferred over other deployment methods such as "turnkey" (waterfall) or "Agile time & materials".
