# Bidding DataMiner

If you bid DataMiner for a [Digital Transformation](xref:Overview_Platform_intro) program, here is what you need to take into account to build a winning proposal.

## Value proposition

- **Goals & objectives**: What are the general goals and objectives of the potential program/project?
- **Value delivery plan**: What is the value delivery plan? What do you know about the deployment build-up window, about going into production, and about how the project will be deployed?
- **Assumptions & dependencies**: What are the known assumptions and dependencies related to the project? What must be taken into account for the proposal?

## Digital Transformation Program

Beyond the DataMiner deployment, there is a set of important intel that contributes to the right value proposition and eventually to a winning bid:

- Are you looking at a relocation program (new office building, new infrastructure, new technology introduction)?
- Are you dealing with a merger of different departments coming together, grouping different sets of roles, resources, and technologies?
- From a business perspective, is the end user looking to optimize staff/resources?
- Are there current products that are facing EOL and will need a replacement? If yes, which ones?
- What is the impact on the current operational workflows? Is the general digital transformation also a window to reassess the workflows of tomorrow (hand in hand with the new technology)? If yes, is all the necessary user intel available to embed in the value proposition proposal?
- Will the introduced technology be operated by different teams, across departments? If yes, which teams will operate the platform, and do you have a buy-in with all of them (planning, engineering, operations, billing, field forces, support teams, etc.)?
- In case a third-party entity will manage/operate the platform, does this entity have the in-house attestations related to the DataMiner DevOps Professional Program? If yes, which ones?
- With respect to change management: are there any or expected pitfalls related to adoption of new software, new workflows, people that need to be taken into account during the offering and deployment of the program? How will the digital transformation and the impact on the users/human aspects be dealt with?

## Platform & scaling

- Is a BOQ available? Which vendors, which data sources (equipment, etc.) are to be integrated into DataMiner?
- Are there third-party platforms (northbound & southbound) that need to be interfaced with? If yes, which ones?
- On which platform will DataMiner be running, and which party will offer the standard off-the-shelf hardware based on the [recommended hardware specifications](xref:DataMiner_Compute_Requirements)?
  - On-premises physical servers
  - On-premises running on [virtual servers/VM instances](xref:Regarding_virtual_servers)
  - User-provided cloud platform
  - DataMiner SaaS â€“ DM Azure

## Creation & delivery

- Who is the prime bidding party in the offer?
- What is the expected role of the prime bidding party related to the following?
  - Local staff availability
  - Liability towards DataMiner installation (physical installation, software installation, remote access, handling IT security, etc.)
  - Local site survey (is this required?)
  - Workflow design and analysis with the end user
  - Testing workflows end to end
- Does the end user have [DataMiner DevOps Engineers](xref:Overview_DevOps_index) at hand who are able to manage, operate, and even grow the platform beyond this program, or is this 100% handled by a third party?
- In case the end user has no in-house DataMiner expertise, do they intend to build up the knowledge and capacity along with this digital transformation program, therefore allowing the platform to evolve continuously?
- Does the end user have an official mandate to be an active party in the design/integration/deployment? Who is allowed to be part of the overall Agile Deploy Squad?
- Does the prime bidding party have the resources related to roles such as:
  - General Product Owner
  - Agile Coach
  - DevOps Quality Coach
  - [DataMiner DevOps Professionals](xref:Overview_DevOps_index) (and what is their current attestation level?)
- Does the prime bidding party have knowledge about the Agile Deploy Manifesto and the [principles of Agile](https://community.dataminer.services/agile-dictionary/) (including but not limited to backlog refinement, burn down chart, daily scrum, DevOps, epics, MVP, sprint planning, etc.)? If not, as part of this program, does the knowledge transfer need to be taken into account?
