# Service delivery

To get started with the DataMiner Partner Program, it is important to note that a proper service delivery is key. This includes:

- **Your champions**: To get started with investing in knowledge and expertise of DataMiner, it is important to pick the right people from the start: People that have the right skills and mindset and have the potential to grow into your first champions, ready to coach and empower more people at a later stage in your journey.
