# DataMiner as a Service: DataMiner nodes and storage nodes as a service

Today's applications need to be highly responsive and always online. To achieve low latency and high availability, instances of these applications need to be deployed in data centers that are close to their users. Applications need to respond in real time to large changes in usage at peak hours, store ever increasing volumes of data, and make this data available to users in milliseconds.

We therefore also offer **DataMiner as a Service (DaaS)**, a DataMiner platform fully hosted by Skyline Communications. Both the solution and the storage are hosted by Skyline in its DataMiner Azure Stack. This allows you to spin up your DataMiner System in the cloud in just a few minutes with Skyline-hosted DataMiner nodes (SaaS).

**You operate the platform, we build and maintain the platform for you.**

Our DaaS model guarantees that you immediately get access to a wide range of capabilities for streamlined and worry-free solution development.

## Benefits of DataMiner as a Service (DaaS)

DataMiner as a Service will allow you to spin up your DataMiner System in the cloud in just a few minutes with cloud-hosted DataMiner nodes. This is what this means:

- *Supercharge your productivity*

  It has never been easier to set up a DataMiner System. Whether you are in need of a quick test, aiming to establish a lab environment, or building a production environment, all it takes is a simple click to effortlessly spin one up. And when you are done, just as easily, you can spin it back down.

  In other words, you gain access to the full power of a DataMiner System, free from any concerns about hardware, infrastructure, or maintenance. It is a hassle-free experience that allows you to focus solely on the task at hand.

- *Experience the convenience of cloud connectivity*

  Since your DataMiner System is spun up in the cloud, you are immediately cloud-connected, which comes with many amazing capabilities, from Live Dashboard Sharing to direct access to DataMiner connectors from the Catalog. Discover all the benefits of being cloud-connected.

- *Benefit from DataMiner Storage as a Service (STaaS)*

  DataMiner as a Service comes with our very own Storage as a Service (STaaS) solution. This means your DataMiner System will immediately benefit from being connected to a scalable and user-friendly cloud-native storage platform. Gone are the days of estimating your storage requirements in advance, placing specific VM orders, or configuring complex Cassandra and OpenSearch clusters with the necessary replication and backup.

- *Security first*

  DaaS is powered by Microsoft Azure and as a result benefits from the same strong security measures: all data is encrypted with 256-bit AES encryption. In addition, we also have a dedicated SecOps team that constantly focuses on optimizing our cloud security.

- *Grow as you go*

  DaaS is built with scalability in mind. This means that you will be able to easily scale both vertically (add or remove resources) and horizontally (add or remove nodes) whenever you need. Another function coming up is intelligent resource distribution or "swarming", which will enable you to automatically redistribute elements between nodes for even more efficiency.

- *Hybrid infrastructure monitoring*

  DaaS will enable you to seamlessly monitor your entire infrastructure regardless of whether it is located on premises or off premises.

## Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB offers single-digit millisecond response times, and automatic and instant scalability, along with guaranteed speed at any scale. Business continuity is assured with SLA-backed availability and enterprise-grade security.

As a fully managed service, Azure Cosmos DB takes database administration off your hands with automatic management, updates, and patching. It also handles capacity management with cost-effective serverless and automatic scaling options that respond to application needs to match capacity with demand.
