# DataMiner Hosting and High Availability

DataMiner's architecture makes it extremely resilient to all types of failures, also because this architecture has no single point of failure.

Skyline Communications offers three different hosting possibilities, each with its own strengths in term of redundancy and high-availability options:

1. Self-hosted DataMiner nodes and storage nodes
1. Self-hosted DataMiner nodes with Storage as a Service
1. DataMiner as a Service: both the DataMiner nodes and the storage nodes as a service

Next to what is described in the above chapters, you will also find hands-on information in our [User Guide](xref:Deploying_a_DataMiner_System).
