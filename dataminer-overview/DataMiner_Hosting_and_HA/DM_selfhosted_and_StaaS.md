# Self-hosted DataMiner nodes with Storage as a Service (STaaS)

If you are looking for hassle-free database storage, the best solution for you is our Storage as a Service (STaaS). This is a powerful option where we manage the storage for you, so you can save on infrastructure and IT maintenance costs. This means your DataMiner System will immediately benefit from being connected to a scalable and user-friendly cloud-native storage platform. You will no longer need to estimate your storage requirements in advance, place specific VM orders, or configure complex Cassandra and OpenSearch clusters with the necessary replication and backup.

With STaaS, you can connect your DataMiner System to a scalable and easy-to-use storage platform, without the effort of setting up and managing your own Cassandra and OpenSearch cluster. You keep your DataMiner nodes self-hosted, and you can use our redundancy/high-availability capabilities on these nodes, but we take care of the database nodes and redundancy implementation.

With DataMiner Storage as a Service (STaaS), you can connect your DataMiner System to dataminer.services in a few clicks, and start enjoying fast, secure, and reliable storage:

- Effortless storage management: No need to mess around with storage clusters or VMs.
- Easy installation: Installed in just a few clicks.
- High scalability: Start small and grow as you go.
- Cost-effective: Only pay for what you use.
- Fast, secure & reliable: Learn more about how we keep dataminer.services safe and secure.

*Grow as you go*

The service is powered by Microsoft Azureâ€™s cloud-native storage solutions, such as Cosmos DB, which offer outstanding performance, scalability, and redundancy. This means that you can start small and easily evolve without any extra effort.

*Easy & flexible configuration*

Our development team has worked tirelessly to ensure all data types are added to the most suitable cloud-native storage provided by Microsoft Azure. And while all of this is being tested and validated rigorously, they are now working on migration options for existing systems and ensuring easy and flexible configuration.

*Pay as you go*

In addition to streamlining your entire workflow, DataMiner STaaS is also extremely cost-effective. You only pay for the storage you are using, making it a great solution for businesses of all sizes.

*Safe & secure*

With DataMiner STaaS, you can rest assured that your data is safe and secure. All data is encrypted with 256-bit AES encryption, which is the default in Azure. We also understand that data sovereignty is crucial to our users, so we offer the option to choose where your data is stored.
