## Accumulating Dojo Reputation Points

To maintain a DataMiner DevOps Professional status and to be an official member of the exclusive DataMiner DevOps Professionals community and unlock the associated benefits, you must accumulate a set quantity of Dojo Reputation Points on an annual basis.

There are three levels available for DataMiner DevOps Professionals, with advocate being the entry level and catalyst being the top tier.

| **ADVOCATE** | **ENABLER** | **CATALYST** |
|--|--|--|
| ***a well-performing community member*** | ***a trusted DevOps Professional*** | ***an advanced DevOps Professional*** |
| 750 points per year | 5,000 points per year | 25,000 points per year |

In general, the more active you are in the DataMiner Dojo community and the more you work with DataMiner, the more Dojo Reputation Points you will accumulate. This can be achieved through a variety of actions, such as:

- **Being active in the Q&A section on Dojo**: Asking, answering and commenting on questions in the [Q&A section](https://community.dataminer.services/questions/) generates Dojo Reputation Points. Moreover, if your answer gets selected as the best answer by the community, you will earn extra Dojo Reputation Points. The person selecting the best answer will get something extra as well. Even voting on questions and answers will further grow your points, as does receiving votes (between 10 to 75 points).

- **Enrolling in and completing online training courses**: The DataMiner Community offers a broad selection of [free online training](https://community.dataminer.services/learning/courses/). Enrolling in and completing any of those courses will again generate points (between 10 to 50 points). Note that the community also offers a variety of free self-tests to evaluate your knowledge. The successful completion of those [quizzes](https://community.dataminer.services/learning/quizzes/) will also result in points.

- **Formal certification**: Optionally, you can go for the paid [formal certification](xref:Overview_Training_certification) of some of your DataMiner skills. Upon obtaining your certification, you will be rewarded with extra points (500 to 1000 points).

- **Contributing to the DataMiner documentation**: DataMiner Devops Professionals work with a community mindset, and sharing knowledge and information is all about empowering each other. Therefore, you are rewarded if you participate in and [contribute to the documentation](xref:contributing) of the DataMiner platform.

- **Contributing to the DataMiner catalog**: If you designed a nice add-on for a DataMiner System for a specific use case and if you are willing to share this in the [DataMiner catalog](https://catalog.dataminer.services/) to help empower the larger DataMiner community, you will be eligible for 250 up to 1000 Dojo Reputation Points. This could be a custom GQI operator, a custom Teams ChatOps operator, an Object Model, a user-definable API, etc.

- **Writing blog posts**: You can opt to write and submit a [blog post](https://community.dataminer.services/blog/) for the community, and upon acceptance, this will result in 500 up to 1000 points. Blog posts can revolve around any technology or topic relevant to the community or could, for example, describe a solution that you have designed with DataMiner.

- **Submitting a use case**: You can choose to submit a [use case](https://community.dataminer.services/use-cases/) for the community, and upon acceptance, this will result in 250 up to 1000 points. Use cases could focus on a new product integration that you completed for DataMiner, or any other type of solution that you have implemented with DataMiner.

- **Being an advocate for the DataMiner brand**: Being an advocate is also part of the culture of being a DataMiner DevOps Professional. Therefore, mentioning DataMiner as part of your skill set in your LinkedIn profile will earn you 500 points per year. If DataMiner is mentioned in the job title in your email signature, we will hit you up with another 250 points per year. Each LinkedIn post that mentions @skyline and uses the tag #dataminerdevops will automatically result in 50 points per post.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to automatic tracking for most of the aforementioned activities to generate points, our community administrators will track certain activities to the best of their abilities to ensure that everybody is awarded all the points they are eligible for in due time. However, you are always welcome to expedite or facilitate the process by highlighting your activities via devops@skyline.be if Reputation Points were not automatically attributed.
