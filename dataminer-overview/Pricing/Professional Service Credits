Agility and adaptability are at the core of DataMiner. Skyline applies the same principles to its professional services: maximum agility with value and budget control in mind.

Instead of buying a certain number of certificates or engineering hours, DataMiner users can order a single product – Skyline professional services credits – which can be used freely towards any of Skyline’s professional services, when you need them and match your priorities.

## Notes

- [1] Except for Agile Awareness and DevOps Enablement, all trainings are available in both in-person and online formats. For in-person training, additional credits are required to cover the transportation and onsite expenses of having the instructor present. These expenses are not included in the course fees.
- [3] The number of hours required by a program depends on factors like number of people, their skills, profile and desired program outcome.  
  Zone A: Europe Central (Limited to Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands).  
  Zone B: Americas and Europe (excluding Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands).  
  Zone C: Africa, Asia Pacific, and Middle East regions.
- [4] Additional credits apply on top of the daily expense costs, based on the number of idle days involved in the visit (i.e. days spent on traveling or weekend onsite).


## FAQ

### What's the difference between buying specific product codes (e.g. Operator Training) and credits?

There’s no difference in pricing — whether you buy a specific product or an equivalent number of credits, the cost is the same.  
The difference is **flexibility**:  
- **Service credits** can be used for *any* type of service.  
- **Product codes** can only be used for that specific service.

Procurement teams often need to define budgets before knowing exactly what services are needed. This makes credits a more practical option. Product-specific purchases often result in unused services or scope changes, which create administrative overhead (change orders, new quotes, etc.).

### Can I still order specific product codes instead of credits?

Yes. You can always request a quote from the Skyline Sales Team.
