## Subscription terms

| Term      | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| *Start Date* | The date when the system comes online. |
| *Duration* | An organization can select a 12-month, 24-month or 36-month subscription. |
| *Renewal Date* | Subscription date + duration.<br>At the Renewal Date, subscriptions renew automatically for 12 months at the then current credit rates, unless agreed otherwise. |
| *MUA* | Monthly Utilization Allowance.<br>A fixed number of credits available per month under the subscription. |
| *Credit Rate* | The credit rate depends on (1) the type of plan (subscription plan or pay-per-use plan), (2) the region and (3) the hosting. As to the latter, it depends whether you opt for a Skyline-hosted solution (i.e. DataMiner as a Service) or a self-hosted infrastructure (on-premises or private Cloud).<br>The price of a credit is protected for the duration of the contract, i.e. 24-month or 36-month subscriptions protect against potential yearly price adjustments. |

### Metering

Metering works in monthly cycles, starting on the first day of each month. MUA is pro-rated for the first and last months.

**Example of a pro-rated calculation:**

MUA: 200 credits<br>Start Date: October 20, 2022<br>Renewal Date: October 19, 2023

- MUA available for the period October 20, 2022 to October 31, 2022 = 200 credits x  12 days / 31 days = 77.4 credits
- MUA available for the period October 1, 2023 to October 19, 2023 =  200 credits x 19 days / 31 days = 122.6 credits

Metering for *Data collection and control plane service* is calculated as the sum of the maximum number of active Managed Objects (for Managed Objects with 100+ metrics) and Metrics (Managed Objects under 100 metrics) at any given time. For this service metering follows the 95% percentile, i.e. it is calculated as the maximum usage after skipping the peak 5% usage, in practice allowing some room (36h per month) for tests or burst of usage.

### Billing and invoicing

| Duration  | Invoicing |
|-----------|------------|
| 12 months | Start date: 100% |
| 24 months | Start date: 60%<br>Start date + 12 months: 40% |
| 36 months | Start date: 60%<br>Start date + 12 months: 20%<br>Start date + 24 months: 20% |

At Renewal Date, the subscription will be invoiced yearly, unless replaced by a new contract.

Consumption above the contracted Monthly Utilization Allowance (MUA) is possible, with the additional consumed credits being invoiced monthly, at the then current Pay-per-Use Credit Rate.

### Cancellation

Subscriptions can be canceled up to 30 days before the Renewal Date. The subscription will remain active until the Renewal Date. The amount paid is not refundable.

### Changing subscription

The subscribed MUA level can be changed at any time without altering the Renewal Date.

- When the MUA level is increased, the additional credits are charged at the then current Credit Rate for a minimum 12-month duration. The new MUA can be used immediately.

- When the MUA level is decreased, the original MUA will be in effect until the Renewal Date. At Renewal Date the subscription will be renewed with the new MUA.

**Example of a billing schedule of which the subscribed MUA level is increased:**

Initial MUA: 200 credits<br>Start Date: November 1, 2022<br>Renewal Date: November 1, 2023

MUA increased to 250 credits on August 1, 2023

- Billing on August 1, 2023: 50 credits x original credit rate x 12 months (i.e. paid until August 1, 2024)
- Billing on November 1, 2023 (i.e. Renewal Date): 200 credits x current credit rate x 12 months  +  50 credits x current credit rate x 4 months
