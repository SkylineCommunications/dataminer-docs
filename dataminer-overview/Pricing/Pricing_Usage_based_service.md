# Usage-based services

The DataMiner usage-based service models, **Subscription Plan** and **Pay-per-Use Plan**, offer organizations the option to leverage the DataMiner technology on a flexible basis to empower their digital transformation. They are available both for private/self-hosted deployments of DataMiner (on the ground, in a private cloud, or hybrid) and for Skyline cloud-hosted solutions (DataMiner Software as a Service).

The key benefits of the DataMiner Subscription Service include:

- **Maximum operational flexibility**: Maximum continuous flexibility in the utilization of DataMiner, at the scale required and leveraging any of the available DataMiner functions as deemed most valuable for the operation at any time, always perfectly aligned with any of the continuously evolving needs of both the operation and the business.

- **Predefined budget aligned with the business**: Operating within the boundaries of a predefined chosen budget, ensuring a well-controlled expenditure perfectly aligned with the business, as well as benefiting from growth incentives to support further acceleration of your business.

## What do you get?

From a functional and operational perspective, the DataMiner usage-based service is an all-inclusive offering. It provides your DevOps teams with everything they could ever potentially need, in an easy, instant, and on-demand manner, fully aligned with their needs at any time.

This includes:

- All available DataMiner functions, including dataminer.services functions.
- The freedom to deploy as many DataMiner nodes as required, i.e. to scale capacity up or down on demand, or to architect the overall solution in the most optimal way (e.g. considering zoning, geographical locations, continuity, etc.).
- Using any of the existing 7000+ connectors to interface DataMiner with third-party products from over 700 different vendors, on a flexible per need basis.
- Requesting new integrations with third-party products, at no additional cost with [Continuity or Evolve plans](https://community.dataminer.services/support-plans/).
- Continuously benefitting from all DataMiner evolutions available, with regard to the DataMiner functions as well as with regard to the connectors to interface with third-party products.
- Accessing our professional technical support services to support the operation.

## Billing & metering

### Organization

An "organization" is the billing entity and the highest level in the hierarchy in [dataminer.services](https://admin.dataminer.services/). Among other things, it is where a company manages its settings, subscription, and billing preferences.

- Multiple DataMiner Systems (DMS) can exist in the same organization, but a DMS can only be associated with one organization.
- DMSs in separate organizations are isolated from each other.
- Metering is done on organization level and is the sum of the usage across all of an organization's DMSs.
- Each organization can have only one active subscription to the usage-based services.

>[!Note]
> Though we recommend having one organization per company, there is no limit to the number of organizations that can be created under the same company. This might be useful in the following scenarios: test or development accounts, managing multiple concurrent subscriptions, or large companies with an Enterprise Agreement with multiple billing entities.

### Usage terms

| Term      | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| *DataMiner Credits* | A flexible form of currency you can use to subscribe to DataMiner software and hosting services. Credits will be deducted automatically when you consume usage-based services. Credits are owned by an organization, and can be consumed among the DataMiner Systems of that organization. The credit balance of an organization is displayed in the [Admin app](https://admin.dataminer.services). |
| *Start Date* | The date when the system comes online. |
| *Duration* | An organization can select a 12-month, 24-month, or 36-month subscription. |
| *Renewal Date* | Subscription date + duration.<br>At the Renewal Date, subscriptions renew automatically for 12 months at the then current credit rates, unless agreed otherwise. |
| *MUA* | Monthly Utilization Allowance.<br>A fixed number of credits available per month under the subscription. |
| *Credit Rate* | The credit rate depends on (1) the type of plan (subscription plan or pay-per-use plan), (2) the region and (3) the hosting. As to the latter, it depends whether you opt for a Skyline-hosted solution (i.e. DataMiner as a Service) or a self-hosted infrastructure (on-premises or private cloud).<br>The price of a credit is protected for the duration of the contract, i.e. 24-month or 36-month subscriptions protect against potential yearly price adjustments. |

### Invoicing

| Duration  | Invoicing |
|-----------|------------|
| 12 months | Start date: 100% |
| 24 months | Start date: 60%<br>Start date + 12 months: 40% |
| 36 months | Start date: 60%<br>Start date + 12 months: 20%<br>Start date + 24 months: 20% |

At Renewal Date, the subscription will be invoiced yearly, unless replaced by a new contract.

Consumption above the contracted Monthly Utilization Allowance (MUA) is possible, with the additional consumed credits being invoiced monthly, at the then current Pay-per-Use Credit Rate.

### Metering Units

| Unit      | Definition | Monthly Metering |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| *Managed Object* | Endpoints directly or indirectly interfaced by DataMiner. Directly interfaced endpoints include data sources, devices, and platforms that expose an interface that allows direct interaction with those endpoints. Indirectly interfaced endpoints include those reported through a mediating data source, for example message brokers (like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ), databases, or Element and Network Management Systems. | Maximum number of active or paused managed objects with 100+ metrics |
| *Metric* | Each data source exposes a set of metrics per managed object. These are the managed objects' read or read-write parameters, available for either monitoring only or monitoring and control. | Sum of all metrics from all managed objects with less than 100 metrics |
| *Cloud Data Consumption* | Traffic consumed as part of [dataminer.services](xref:Overview_DCP). | Sum of total GB of traffic |
| *Connector Services* | Use of Skyline-developed connectors (also known as DataMiner protocols or interface drivers) made available through the [catalog](https://catalog.dataminer.services/). <br>Connectors developed by the user or other third party are not counted. | Sum of used connectors delivered by Skyline |
| *Script Runs* | Every time Automation scripts are [triggered](xref:Running_Automation_scripts). Among others, this includes Life cycle Service Orchestration (LSO) scripts, Profile-Load Scripts (PLS), Process Automation activities, DOM instance state transitions, and user-defined API calls. | Sum of script runs |

> [!NOTE]
> Metering for the *Data collection and control plane service* is calculated as the sum of the maximum number of active Managed Objects (for Managed Objects with 100+ metrics) and Metrics (Managed Objects under 100 metrics) at any given time. For this, service metering follows the 95% percentile, meaning that it is calculated as the maximum usage after skipping the peak 5% usage, in practice allowing some room (36h per month) for tests or bursts of usage.

### Metering Period

Metering works in monthly cycles, starting on the first day of each month. MUA is pro-rated for the first and last months.

**Example of a pro-rated calculation:**

MUA: 200 credits<br>Start Date: October 20, 2022<br>Renewal Date: October 19, 2023

- MUA available for the period October 20, 2022 to October 31, 2022 = 200 credits x  12 days / 31 days = 77.4 credits
- MUA available for the period October 1, 2023 to October 19, 2023 =  200 credits x 19 days / 31 days = 122.6 credits

### Cancellation

Subscriptions can be canceled up to 30 days before the Renewal Date. The subscription will remain active until the Renewal Date. The amount paid is not refundable.

### Changing subscription

The subscribed MUA level can be changed at any time without altering the Renewal Date.

- When the MUA level is increased, the additional credits are charged at the then current Credit Rate for a minimum 12-month duration. The new MUA can be used immediately.

- When the MUA level is decreased, the original MUA will be in effect until the Renewal Date. At Renewal Date the subscription will be renewed with the new MUA.

**Example of a billing schedule of which the subscribed MUA level is increased:**

Initial MUA: 200 credits<br>Start Date: November 1, 2022<br>Renewal Date: November 1, 2023

MUA increased to 250 credits on August 1, 2023

- Billing on August 1, 2023: 50 credits x original credit rate x 12 months (i.e. paid until August 1, 2024)
- Billing on November 1, 2023 (i.e. Renewal Date): 200 credits x current credit rate x 12 months  +  50 credits x current credit rate x 3 months
