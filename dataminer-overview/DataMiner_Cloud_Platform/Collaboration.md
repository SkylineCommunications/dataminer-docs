## Remote Access

**Remote Access** consisting of **Remote app access** and **Remote Cube access** *(coming soon)* gives you the ability to access your environment from anywhere. Via Remote app access (HTML), accessible on dataminer.services, you can go to all the low-code apps created in your environment. Especially handy is the Monitoring app: a lightweight version of Cube. In addition to this, Remote Cube access *(coming soon)* is also on the horizon and will allow secure and effortless remote access to your entire Cube environment without the need for a VPN connection.

## ChatOps

**ChatOps** is a feature that enhances the value of **Microsoft Teams** as you collaborate more effectively using insights and controls from your DataMiner System directly in Microsoft Teams. Users can interact with DataMiner using generic or custom chat commands, and you can even use DataMiner Automation to manage teams and channels and interact with users in chats and channels. ChatOps is especially useful for teams that need to communicate and interact with one another frequently. In the future, we plan to offer support for ChatOps on **Slack** as well, as it is a widely used team messaging platform.

## API Share *(coming soon)*

Share your **user-defined APIs** with anybody who needs the provided data to control and trigger more complex actions in DataMiner.

User-defined API sharing is primarily focused on **machine-to-machine interactions** (whereas our low-code app sharing, mentioned below, is primarily focused on peer-to-peer sharing). Both functions will provide the ability to share data with a specific audience, allowing for more precise control and triggering of complex actions in DataMiner.

## App Share *(coming soon)*

Share your low-code app along with its underlying data with a defined target audience to control and trigger more complex actions in DataMiner.

**Low-code app sharing** is primarily focused on **peer-to-peer sharing** (whereas our user-defined API sharing, mentioned above, is primarily focused on machine-to-machine interactions). Both functions will provide the ability to share data with a specific audience, allowing for more precise control and triggering of complex actions in DataMiner.
