## Health

The **Health package** is an insurance policy for your system that includes features like automated log file collection in order to act quicker and the upcoming **SPI (System Performance Indicators) collection** *(coming soon)* for proactive support. Thanks to automated log file collection, we can provide faster support without requiring a user action. The upcoming SPI collection, currently under development, aims to enhance visibility by providing superior coverage through a steady flow of data, which ensures that even proactive support can be offered. This means that potential incidents will be identified early on, allowing for prompt discovery and resolution before they impact the user.

## Storage as a Service (STaaS)

Platform services prioritize convenience. The hassle of managing your own Cassandra and Elasticsearch database clusters is a thing of the past. With the scaling and complexity taken care of, you and your team can focus on the core business of your company. Our Storage as a Service (STaaS) solution streamlines your core operations by utilizing Skyline’s hosting service for your storage cluster, resulting in a significant reduction of on-premises resources, configuration, and maintenance.

This is a powerful option where we manage the storage for you, so you can save on infrastructure and IT maintenance costs.
