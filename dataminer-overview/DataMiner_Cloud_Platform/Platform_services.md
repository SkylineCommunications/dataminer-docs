*Less overhead and higher availability, thanks to “as-a-service” options.*

## Health

The **Health package** is an insurance policy for your system that includes features like automated log file collection in order to act quicker and the upcoming **SPI (System Performance Indicators) collection** *(coming soon)* for proactive support. Thanks to automated log file collection, we can provide faster support without requiring a user action. The upcoming SPI collection, currently under development, aims to enhance visibility by providing superior coverage through a steady flow of data, which ensures that even proactive support can be offered. This means that potential incidents will be identified early on, allowing for prompt discovery and resolution before they impact the user.

## Storage as a Service *(coming soon)*

Platform services prioritize convenience. Imagine not having to manage your Cassandra and Elasticsearch database clusters anymore. With the scaling and complexity taken care of, you and your team can focus on the core business of your company. We are developing a Storage as a Service (STaaS) solution that streamlines your core operations by utilizing Skyline’s hosting service for your storage cluster, resulting in a significant reduction of on-premises resources, configuration, and maintenance.

## DataMiner Node as a Service *(coming soon)*

To enhance convenience further, our next step is to provide **DataMiner node as a Service**, which simplifies the deployment of DataMiner nodes in on-premises and private cloud environments. This will greatly ease the installation and integration process.

## DataMiner as a Service *(coming soon)*

Finally, **DataMiner as a Service** will allow you to spin up your DataMiner System in the cloud in just a few minutes with Skyline-hosted DataMiner nodes (SaaS). While we’re working on the general acceptance of those services, customers can already contact us today!
