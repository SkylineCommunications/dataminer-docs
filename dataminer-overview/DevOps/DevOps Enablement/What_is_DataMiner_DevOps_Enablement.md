# What is DataMiner DevOps Enablement?

## About DevOps

A powerful, agile, data-driven operation heavily depends on the successful implementation of a DevOps style of operation.

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increase an organization’s ability to **deliver applications and services at high velocity**: evolving and improving products and services at a faster pace than organizations using traditional processes.

## About DataMiner and DevOps

DataMiner as a technology is purposefully designed to empower a DevOps style of operation.

Similar to other typical technology evolutions that you can witness today (e.g. increasingly more virtualized products that replace hardware products, an ever-growing offering of on-demand cloud services, and all-IP propositions), DataMiner is a so-called **transformational technology**.

In other words, **DataMiner is not designed to do just one thing**, but rather to have the unique capabilities and qualities to empower agile teams to create and evolve their own solutions, and to tailor those to their specific business needs, and all this in an easy, secure, and continuous fashion.

But DataMiner is even more than that. It is a transformational technology that enables you to tap into the full current and future potential of the entire new generation of other transformational technologies (such as all-IP, virtualized, and cloudified products).

This makes it a very strategic technology asset that can be leveraged to make a considerable impact. **DataMiner sits at the heart of Digital Transformation and empowers businesses to achieve the key objectives of Digital Transformation.**

The initiative can be organized independently, for anybody who already has a DataMiner-empowered operation, but typically also runs in parallel with each contracted project.

It provides a multitude of formal and informal initiatives to work towards the explicit end goal of having a fully empowered DevOps team at the user organization, ready to both further leverage DataMiner and continue to deliver incremental value both to the business and the underlying operation. Because that’s what it is all about in the new world.
