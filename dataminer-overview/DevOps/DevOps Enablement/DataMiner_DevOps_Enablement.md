# DataMiner DevOps Enablement Service

At Skyline, we are laser-focused on our mission to ensure that you can deliver exceptional ICT media and broadband services.

Today, this must be accomplished in a world empowered by transformational technology, consisting of virtualized products, cloudified services, and all-IP connectivity. This form of technology offers everyone limitless options and tremendous opportunity to innovate continuously.

Therefore, Skyline’s mission translates directly into ensuring that you can **build and operate a powerful, agile data-driven operation**, an operation that can evolve and adapt continuously by leveraging all these **transformational technologies** to the maximum extent, easily and securely.

Achieving this requires more than simply deploying these transformational technologies to deliver your services. After all, **building a properly architected overall technology stack** with these transformational technologies is of key importance as well.

This should be done in such a way that this stack effectively enables you to leverage both the current as well as the future potential of all the transformational technology that it consists of, and this in a secure, easy, and scalable manner.

So, there’s quite a bit that needs to be wrapped around these transformational technology building blocks to create a so-called composable technology stack. This is a technology stack that you can conduct like an orchestra, depending on what direction you need to take your business to deal with the unexpected.

But even that doesn’t suffice. Building teams and an entire organization around that composable technology stack, in line with the agile culture and mindset, is of equal, tremendous importance. In other words, we aspire to build an **entire organization that is empowered to innovate and evolve continuously in a quick and efficient manner**.
