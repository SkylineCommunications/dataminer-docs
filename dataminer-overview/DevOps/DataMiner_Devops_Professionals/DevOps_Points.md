# Accumulating DevOps Points

To maintain a DataMiner DevOps Professional status and to be an official member of the exclusive DataMiner DevOps Professionals community and unlock the associated [benefits](xref:Benefits_DevOps_Professionals_Program), you must accumulate a set quantity of DevOps Points [on an annual basis](#devops-points-life-cycle).

There are three levels available for DataMiner DevOps Professionals, with *Advocate* being the entry level and *Catalyst* being the top tier.

| **ADVOCATE** | **ENABLER** | **CATALYST** |
|--|--|--|
| ***a well-performing community member*** | ***a trusted DevOps Professional*** | ***an advanced DevOps Professional*** |
| 750 points per year | 5,000 points per year | 25,000 points per year |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your DevOps Points expire once a period of 12 months has passed since you first signed up. For more information, see [DevOps Points life cycle](#devops-points-life-cycle).

In general, the more active you are in the DataMiner Dojo community and the more you work with DataMiner, the more DevOps Points you will accumulate. This can be achieved through a variety of actions, such as:

- **Being active in the Q&A section on Dojo**: Asking, answering, and commenting on questions in the [Q&A section](https://community.dataminer.services/questions/) generates DevOps Points. Moreover, if your answer gets selected as the best answer by the community, you will earn extra DevOps Points. The person selecting the best answer will get something extra as well. Even voting on questions and answers will further grow your points, as does receiving votes (between 10 to 75 points).

- **Enrolling in and completing online training courses**: The DataMiner Community offers a broad selection of [free online training](https://community.dataminer.services/learning/courses/). Enrolling in and completing any of those courses will again generate points (between 10 to 50 points). Note that the community also offers a variety of free self-tests to evaluate your knowledge. The successful completion of those [quizzes](https://community.dataminer.services/learning/quizzes/) will also result in points.

- **Formal certification**: Optionally, you can go for the paid [formal certification](xref:Overview_Training_certification) of some of your DataMiner skills. Upon obtaining your certification, you will be rewarded with extra points (500 to 1000 points).

- **Contributing to the DataMiner documentation**: DataMiner Devops Professionals work with a community mindset, and sharing knowledge and information is all about empowering each other. Therefore, you are rewarded if you participate in and [contribute to the documentation](xref:contributing) of the DataMiner platform.

DataMiner solutions are designed to resolve specific technological problems or challenges.

- **Submitting feedback**: Your feedback is valuable. You will receive DevOps Points per submission of feedback via <https://aka.dataminer.services/Feedback/>. Each submission of feedback will result in 50 DevOps Points (limited to a maximum of 100 points per month).

- **Being an advocate for the DataMiner brand**: Being an advocate is also part of the culture of being a DataMiner DevOps Professional. That's why you can earn 250 points simply by adding your DataMiner DevOps level to your LinkedIn headline. Once you've updated your LinkedIn profile, you can send an email to [devops@skyline.be](mailto:devops@skyline.be) with the link to your profile page and we will get you your points! If DataMiner is mentioned in the job title in your email signature, we will hit you up with another 250 points per year. Each LinkedIn post that mentions @skyline and uses the tag #dataminerdevops will automatically result in 50 points per post.

- **Reward for outstanding DevOps mindset**: From time to time, Skyline staff members have the opportunity to nominate registered DataMiner DevOps Professionals who exemplify an exceptional DevOps mindset and demonstrate the effective application of associated best practices. Such recognition leads to the allocation of additional points in the range of 100 up to 750 on the recipient's DataMiner DevOps Professional account.

> In addition to automatic tracking for most of the aforementioned activities to generate points, our community administrators will track certain activities to the best of their abilities to ensure that everybody is awarded all the points they are eligible for in due time. However, you are always welcome to expedite or facilitate the process by highlighting your activities via [devops@skyline.be](mailto:devops@skyline.be) if DevOps Points were not automatically attributed.

## DevOps Points life cycle

The life cycle of DevOps Points operates as follows:

- **Expiration**: The DevOps Points you have collected expire after 12 months from your sign-up date for the program (referred to as your anniversary date). However, although your DevOps Points total will reset to zero, you will retain the DevOps Professional status you had on your anniversary date.

- **Renewal period**: After your anniversary date, a new 12-month period begins. During this period, you have the opportunity to gather enough points to reach a higher status level.

- **Status maintenance**: If, by the end of the 12-month period, you have not accumulated sufficient points to retain your current status level, you will lose your status and be demoted to a lower level, if applicable (e.g. from enabler to advocate).

Example:

- You sign up for the DevOps Professional Program on April 12, 2023. This means you have until April 12, 2024, to reach the next status level (i.e. a 12-month period).

- By June 12th, you have earned 750 DevOps Points, qualifying you as an advocate.

- By November 24th, you have earned 5000 DevOps Points, qualifying you as an enabler.

- Upon reaching your first anniversary on April 12, 2024, you have earned a total of 7600 DevOps Points. Your DevOps Points are reset to zero, but you retain your enabler level. To maintain this status, you will need to accumulate 5000 DevOps Points again before April 12, 2025.

  ![DevOpsPointsLifeCycle](~/dataminer-overview/images/DevOps_Life_Cycle1.svg)

- By August 13th, you have earned 750 DevOps Points, ensuring your advocate status at the end of the 12-month period. However, despite reaching the advocate status again, you still remain an enabler, as the 12-month period has not elapsed yet.

- Upon reaching your second anniversary on April 12, 2025, you have earned a total of 4300 DevOps Points. You did not accumulate the required 5000 Points to retain the enabler level within a 12-month period. Consequently, you are now demoted to the advocate level. To retain this level, you will need to collect 750 DevOps Points before April 12, 2026.

  ![DevOpsPointsLifeCycle2](~/dataminer-overview/images/DevOps_Life_Cycle2.svg)

- By June 5th, you have earned 750 DevOps Points, ensuring your advocate status at the end of the 12-month period.

- By September 9th, you have earned 5000 DevOps Points and are promoted to the enabler level.

- Upon reaching your third anniversary on April 12, 2026, you have earned a total of 7500 DevOps Points and have reached the enabler level.
