# Accumulating DevOps Points

To maintain a DataMiner DevOps Professional status and to be an official member of the exclusive DataMiner DevOps Professionals community and unlock the associated benefits, you must accumulate a set quantity of DevOps Points on an annual basis.

There are three levels available for DataMiner DevOps Professionals, with *Advocate* being the entry level and *Catalyst* being the top tier.

| **ADVOCATE** | **ENABLER** | **CATALYST** |
|--|--|--|
| ***a well-performing community member*** | ***a trusted DevOps Professional*** | ***an advanced DevOps Professional*** |
| 750 points per year | 5,000 points per year | 25,000 points per year |

In general, the more active you are in the DataMiner Dojo community and the more you work with DataMiner, the more DevOps Points you will accumulate. This can be achieved through a variety of actions, such as:

- **Being active in the Q&A section on Dojo**: Asking, answering, and commenting on questions in the [Q&A section](https://community.dataminer.services/questions/) generates DevOps Points. Moreover, if your answer gets selected as the best answer by the community, you will earn extra DevOps Points. The person selecting the best answer will get something extra as well. Even voting on questions and answers will further grow your points, as does receiving votes (between 10 to 75 points).

- **Enrolling in and completing online training courses**: The DataMiner Community offers a broad selection of [free online training](https://community.dataminer.services/learning/courses/). Enrolling in and completing any of those courses will again generate points (between 10 to 50 points). Note that the community also offers a variety of free self-tests to evaluate your knowledge. The successful completion of those [quizzes](https://community.dataminer.services/learning/quizzes/) will also result in points.

- **Formal certification**: Optionally, you can go for the paid [formal certification](xref:Overview_Training_certification) of some of your DataMiner skills. Upon obtaining your certification, you will be rewarded with extra points (500 to 1000 points).

- **Contributing to the DataMiner documentation**: DataMiner Devops Professionals work with a community mindset, and sharing knowledge and information is all about empowering each other. Therefore, you are rewarded if you participate in and [contribute to the documentation](xref:contributing) of the DataMiner platform.

  Point system:

  - **Correct a spelling or grammar mistake**: Spotted a typo while browsing the documentation? Click the "propose changes" button in the top-right corner and correct it yourself. **25 points**
  
  - **Add missing information**: Noticed something missing halfway through reading a page on docs.dataminer.services? Add it yourself and earn up to... **300 points**

  - **Deliver documentation**: Not quite comfortable using GitHub but bursting with inspiration? Send your documentation as a Word file to [Team Documentation](mailto:documentation@skyline.be) at Skyline so they can add it to DataMiner docs. Doing this, you can earn up to... **500 points**

  - **Make a large contribution to docs**: Are you an expert on a DataMiner-related topic? Make a large contribution to the DataMiner docs using GitHub! Earn up to... **1000 points**

- **Writing blog posts**: You can opt to write and submit a [blog post](https://community.dataminer.services/blog/) for the community, and upon acceptance, this will result in 500 up to 1000 points. Blog posts can revolve around any technology or topic relevant to the community or could, for example, describe a solution that you have designed with DataMiner.

- **Submitting a use case**: You can choose to submit a [use case](https://community.dataminer.services/use-cases/) for the community, and upon acceptance, this will result in 250 up to 2500 points.

- **Submitting feedback**: Your feedback is valuable. You will receive DevOps Points per submission of feedback via <https://aka.dataminer.services/Feedback/>. Each submission of feedback will result in 50 DevOps Points (limited to a maximum of 100 points per month).

- **Being an advocate for the DataMiner brand**: Being an advocate is also part of the culture of being a DataMiner DevOps Professional. That's why you can earn 250 points simply by adding your DataMiner DevOps level to your LinkedIn headline. Once you've updated your LinkedIn profile, you can send an email to [devops@skyline.be](mailto:devops@skyline.be) with the link to your profile page and we will get you your points! If DataMiner is mentioned in the job title in your email signature, we will hit you up with another 250 points per year. Each LinkedIn post that mentions @skyline and uses the tag #dataminerdevops will automatically result in 50 points per post.

- **Reward for outstanding DevOps mindset**: From time to time, Skyline staff members have the opportunity to nominate registered DataMiner DevOps Professionals who exemplify an exceptional DevOps mindset and demonstrate the effective application of associated best practices. Such recognition leads to the allocation of additional points in the range of 100 up to 750 on the recipient's DataMiner DevOps Professional account.
