## Accumulating DevOps Points

To maintain a DataMiner DevOps Professional status and to be an official member of the exclusive DataMiner DevOps Professionals community and unlock the associated benefits, you must accumulate a set quantity of DevOps Points on an annual basis.

There are three levels available for DataMiner DevOps Professionals, with *Advocate* being the entry level and *Catalyst* being the top tier.

| **ADVOCATE** | **ENABLER** | **CATALYST** |
|--|--|--|
| ***a well-performing community member*** | ***a trusted DevOps Professional*** | ***an advanced DevOps Professional*** |
| 750 points per year | 5,000 points per year | 25,000 points per year |

In general, the more active you are in the DataMiner Dojo community and the more you work with DataMiner, the more DevOps Points you will accumulate. This can be achieved through a variety of actions, such as:

- **Being active in the Q&A section on Dojo**: Asking, answering, and commenting on questions in the [Q&A section](https://community.dataminer.services/questions/) generates DevOps Points. Moreover, if your answer gets selected as the best answer by the community, you will earn extra DevOps Points. The person selecting the best answer will get something extra as well. Even voting on questions and answers will further grow your points, as does receiving votes (between 10 to 75 points).

- **Completing online training courses**: The DataMiner Community offers a broad selection of [free online training](https://community.dataminer.services/learning/courses/). Enrolling in and completing any of those courses will again generate points (between 10 to 50 points). Note that the community also offers a variety of free self-tests to evaluate your knowledge. The successful completion of those [quizzes](https://community.dataminer.services/learning/quizzes/) will also result in points.

- **Getting your DataMiner skills certified**: Optionally, you can go for the paid [formal certification](xref:Overview_Training_certification) of some of your DataMiner skills. Upon obtaining your certification, you will be rewarded with extra points (500 to 1000 points).

- **Contributing to the DataMiner documentation**: DataMiner Devops Professionals work with a community mindset, and sharing knowledge and information is all about empowering each other. Therefore, you are rewarded if you participate in and [contribute to the documentation](xref:contributing) of the DataMiner platform.

- **Submitting feedback**: Your feedback is valuable. You will receive DevOps Points per submission of feedback via <https://aka.dataminer.services/Feedback/>. Each submission of the Customer Satisfaction Survey will result in 50 DevOps Points (limited to a maximum of 100 points per month).

- **Being an advocate for the DataMiner brand**: Being an advocate is also part of the culture of being a DataMiner DevOps Professional. That's why you can earn 250 points simply by adding your DataMiner DevOps level to your LinkedIn headline. Once you've updated your LinkedIn profile, you can send an email to [devops@skyline.be](mailto:devops@skyline.be) with the link to your profile page and we will get you your points! If DataMiner is mentioned in the job title in your email signature, we will hit you up with another 250 points per year. Each LinkedIn post that mentions @skyline and uses the tag #dataminerdevops will automatically result in 50 points per post.

- **Reward for an outstanding DevOps mindset**: From time to time, Skyline staff members have the opportunity to nominate registered DataMiner DevOps Professionals who embody an exceptional DevOps mindset and demonstrate the effective application of associated best practices. This recognition results in the allocation of additional points, ranging from 100 up to 750, to the recipient's DataMiner DevOps Professional account.

> In addition to automatic tracking for most of the aforementioned activities to generate points, our community administrators will track certain activities to the best of their abilities to ensure that everybody is awarded all the points they are eligible for in due time.
