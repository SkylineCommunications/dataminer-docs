# Required skill sets

Recommended and focus skill sets are not prerequisites. After all, we live in an ever faster evolving technology landscape where **continuous learning is the new normal**. Therefore, passion and the ability to absorb new knowledge prevail over the existing skill sets of a candidate.

Of course, it is equally essential to ensure that you set up a **continuous learning program** for the DataMiner DevOps Professionals, to evolve their existing skill sets as well as to acquire new ones. These skill sets can both relate to DataMiner itself and to other associated skills.

On DataMiner Dojo, you can find [an extensive overview of all skill sets](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-devops-professional-program/#expectations) that can be obtained through a continuous learning program.
