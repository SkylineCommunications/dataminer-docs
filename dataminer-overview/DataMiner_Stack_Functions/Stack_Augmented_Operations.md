# Augmented Operations

***Ensure maximum uptime by leveraging big data and AI.***

![stack.functions.categories](~/dataminer-overview/images/stack_augmented_operations.png)

**Make the shift from reactive to proactive management.**

The DataMiner Augmented Operations technology **captures, correlates, and analyzes** all data sources in **real time**. It learns the relationships between metrics and generates alarms when anomalies are detected. This predictive approach improves performance and reduces system downtime.

This technology, built into the core of DataMiner, leverages state-of-the-art big data and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. As we are dealing with **increasingly more complex and agile ecosystems that are continuously evolving**, the way things are set up today could be very different as opposed to how they are set up tomorrow.

Today’s operations are more about the **behavior of metrics and resources rather than their absolute state or value**, and about how they are evolving over time. A certain value that is normal right now could be the same value one hour later but with a completely different context, because of services that have been added, the time of the day, etc., turning it into a value that is no longer normal for ongoing operations.

At the same time, DataMiner Augmented Operations allow you to **reduce time for setup and configuration, and increase the efficiency of management**.

This will **provide operators with unprecedented insights in the most complex operation** and enhance the experience of the operator by augmenting data and making them easier to interpret.

Combined with the ability to **leverage the unique end-to-end value proposition of DataMiner**, DataMiner Augmented Operations are simply indispensable to manage tomorrow’s operational ecosystems in a proactive manner.

The **fully integrated out-of-the-box solution** with its **self-learning technology** increases efficiency and accuracy, drastically reduces configuration effort and cost, and helps in adopting a proactive operating strategy.

## Trend Forecast

**Predictions based on data.**

The AI-powered forecasting functionality automatically learns the behavior and evolution of the operational system and its performance metrics, and extends that towards the future, allowing the operator to gain more in-depth insights and manage the operation more proactively.

## Automated Tagging (a.k.a. Pattern Matching)

**Automated application of tags to describe content.**

Through automatic tagging functionality, behavioral patterns in trend data, special events, and behavioral changes can be easily tagged to enrich an operation with context information and empower advanced behavioral monitoring.

Based on AI pattern matching algorithms, instances of tagged patterns are automatically recognized and labeled both in historical trend data and in the new incoming real-time data.

## Change Point Detection

**Detecting abrupt shifts in time series trends.**

DataMiner’s change point detection solution automatically identifies both abrupt and subtle behavioral changes in the trend data of individual performance metrics in (semi) real time. Detection of a change in level, trend, or variance can be applied for early fault detection, as a user can be warned about previously unseen or rare behavior. Knowledge of change points also proves useful in improving the modeling and prediction of the metric behavior, and in the automatic detection of relationships between metrics or DataMiner objects.

## Anomaly Detection

**Locating unusual points or patterns in a set of data.**

An anomaly significance scoring mechanism augments the change point detection solution and identifies the changes in metric behavior that are truly exceptional or unexpected, taking historical metric behavior and previously detected change points into account.

## Incident Notification (a.k.a. Automatic Incident Tracking)

**Reporting of certain trigger events.**

The Automatic Incident Tracking feature autonomously learns about system behavior and leverages the rich context of alarms and relational information available in a DataMiner System to automatically correlate alarms belonging to a specific incident. No manual pre-analysis or time-consuming setup and configuration of correlation logic is required.

## Focus Alarms

**Showing past behavior of alarms.**

Based on an analysis of the alarm history and its patterns, the focused alarms option reduces alarm noise and allows easy focus on the events and incidents that are truly impactful.
Focus alarms only show the "unexpected" alarms and ignore recurring alarms due to bad template configuration.

## Proactive Cap Detection

**Detecting critical highs and lows in your network before they occur.**

The proactive cap detection solution provides an automated zero-configuration risk analysis for metrics to hit important key values, such as the absolute minimum or maximum value of a metric, or a user-defined alarm threshold.

By continuously monitoring and modeling the trend of the metrics, proactive cap detection will give the user an early warning if it predicts problems on a metric in the future, without generating false positive alarms. This enables a proactive way of tackling emerging issues and prevents issues from affecting services.
