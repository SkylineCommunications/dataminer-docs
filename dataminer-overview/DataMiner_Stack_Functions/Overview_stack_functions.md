# DataMiner stack functions

A **modular architecture** allows for customization of modules and the addition of new functionality as needed, without complex integrations or upgrades. This flexibility enables operators to build a platform that **meets their unique needs** and **expand it to support new services or technologies**.

DataMiner functions are the **foundation of your data-driven operation**. They make it easy to create powerful solutions by **cherry-picking the building blocks you need**. Plus, their modular architecture lets you build **a scalable operation** and integrate with third-party applications and services. This gives you the flexibility to create better, faster, and cheaper solutions.

So, what exactly are those stack functions?
