## Performance Management

**Ensuring that a set of activities and outputs meets an organization's goals in an effective and efficient manner.**

This particular stack function keeps track of detailed historical key performance readings up to more than one year. Any parameter made available by the API of any data source (e.g. interface bandwidth, utilization (Mbps, %), rate errors, collisions, CPU usage, etc.) can be trended for later evaluation of its performance, for example for debugging or forecasting of future behavior.

DataMiner allows the user to define exactly for which parameters trending information has to be logged in the trending database and which kind of trending information has to be included. In a trend template, you can define both the scope (which parameters) and the type (real-time data, average trending, or a combination of both) of the trend information to be stored in the trending database.

In systems using [Storage as a Service](xref:STaaS) or a [self-hosted setup with indexing database](xref:Databases_about), DataMiner’s [Augmented Operations](xref:Stack_Augmented_Operations) are enabled, including AI features such as trend prediction, pattern matching and much more.

## Event correlation

**Detect identifiable patterns by relating various events.**

The fully integrated Correlation Engine is a valuable asset for operators seeking to expedite the repair process through automated root cause analysis and move towards a proactive operation.

Correlation Engine provides the technology to further enhance alarm detection within the operational environment by processing the raw alarm information utilizing on a user-defined knowledge base, in real time as events occur.

The Correlation Engine is capable of:

- Detecting single alarm events and patterns of alarm occurrences across the entire system.

- Checking real-time parameter values, prior to making any decisions or taking actions.

- Detecting single occurrences, persistent occurrences, or recurring occurrences of both single alarms events and alarm patterns across the entire operational environment.

- Taking actions when certain conditions occur within the operational environment, including generating new alarm messages for the operator (e.g. the most probable cause), triggering Automation scripts (e.g. to take automatic corrective measures), notifying operators, and more.

DataMiner also includes root cause analysis (RCA) based on connectivity information. Connectivity information can be fed into the system via the integrated connectivity editor or by linking the DataMiner System to a third-party connectivity database. DataMiner's RCA functionality offers operators a highly intuitive method to determine the most probable cause and filter out sympathetic alarms. This is achieved by assigning an RCA level to each alarm, indicating how far they are removed from their probable root cause.

Furthermore, the core engine offers [**sophisticated off-the-shelf, self-learning algorithms**](xref:Stack_Augmented_Operations) to intelligently and effortlessly monitor and track the most challenging operational metrics, including traffic loads, slowly degrading quality metrics, and much more.

Today, **raw data collection** is the foundation of an efficient architecture. It maximizes the availability of information for the management platform to carry out its functions.

To address the challenges of fault detection, ensuring **good data hygiene** is key. DataMiner includes various ways to guarantee data hygiene, including:

- Fully user-definable and run-time-applied alarm thresholds defined in templates.
- Dynamic switching of alarm definitions based on time or events (e.g. upon service activation).
- Ability to stack alarm templates to easily and efficiently manage thresholds across vast deployments.
- Support for relative and absolute thresholds, including a variety of baseline methods.
- Hysteresis on trigger and/or clear, applicable to all individual thresholds.
- Conditional alarming to prevent unnecessary alarm clutter.

**Unified fault detection** is one of the most fundamental and critical functionalities of a management platform. DataMiner offers a unified approach with significant advantages:

- Gaining massive amounts of time to define and apply thresholds across your entire operation.
- Customizing alarm definitions exactly the way your operation requires, eliminating noisy alarms.
- Triggering alarms in a far more intelligent way and reducing the alarm count to what is truly necessary.
- Conserving valuable resources and time by reducing the need to resolve shortcomings with complex and cumbersome event correlation.
- Significantly reducing Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), increasing operational efficiency, lowering operational costs, and increasing Quality of Service (QoS).

The unified platform provides **highly enriched fault messages**, **out of the box requiring zero effort**.
