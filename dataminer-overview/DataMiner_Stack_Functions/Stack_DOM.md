## Object Modeling

Visual representation of software or system objects, attributes, actions, and relationships.

Data modeling involves the process of creating logical representations of the data stored in an operation.

The **DataMiner Object Model (DOM)** enables the quick modeling and management of any type of **administrative or business-related data** within your DataMiner System, such as ticketing and jobs information, planned maintenance records, product catalog data, contractual and customer records, and more.

All defined DOM instances are stored in an Elasticsearch database to ensure optimal performance and scalability.
