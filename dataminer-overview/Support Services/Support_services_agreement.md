## Support plans

Skyline offers two levels of Support Services: Continuity and Evolve. An overview and description of the two levels of Support Services offered by Skyline can be found on [DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/support-services/).

## Supported products

Skyline provides Support Services for its Software only, which consists of its core software, connectors and cloud components. Skyline does not provide Support Services for third-party components, except for maintenance on database content for supported databases. An overview of supported databases can be found on [DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/3rd-party-software-support-life-cycle).

## Supported versions

Support and Updates for the Software shall only be provided on the two latest main releases of the Software. A new main release is issued by Skyline about every year. Main releases contain all new features and cumulative updates that were issued since the previous main release.

It is User's responsibility to make sure that their Software is updated timely to a supported Software version. An up-to-date Support timeline shall be available on [DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-supported-versions-lifecycle/).

## Upgrades and updates

Upgrades and Updates will be available to download on Skyline's DataMiner Cloud Platform.

By default, new Updates shall be released via cumulative updates only. However, in exceptional situations Skyline and the User may mutually agree to opt for a less tested emergency hotfix instead.

Updates for Software connectors provided by Skyline are limited to changes related to evolutions of existing product interfaces with third-party products. Substantial new interfaces on third-party products released by the third party require the purchase of a new Software connector to interface with.

Upgrades shall be released in Skyline's discretion and based on the technology innovations that take into account the general interest of all Users and the overall roadmap of the Software and Skyline's business.

Installation of Updates and Upgrades on the User's system by Skyline is not included in the Support Services. 

Installation and configuration of hardware and databases (Cassandra, Elasticsearch, etc.) in the User's system by Skyline is not included in the Support Services.

## Support for software issues

Skyline shall provide Support to User for Software Issues. On-site support is not included in the Support Services. Issues reported by User to Skyline will be handled by Skyline within the time limits set out in [Schedule 1](#schedule-1-support-plan).

User shall ensure that it has an industry-standard and uninterrupted remote access system in place to allow Skyline to provide Support. User ensures that any personal data processed for the purpose of giving Skyline access to their system is done in line with applicable data protection laws.

## Ticket generation

When User encounters an Issue with the Software, or wishes to receive Support for another reason, User can at their choice [open a ticket for Support or call Skyline's Support helpdesk](https://skyline.be/contact/tech-support).

Tickets for Support can be generated through Skyline's DataMiner Cloud Platform.

Support is available during Business Hours only, except if the User has purchased an Out of Business Hours Support plan. If User wishes to create a ticket in follow-up of its telephone support, User needs to generate a ticket through Skyline's DataMiner Cloud Platform.

User can always consult the status of their tickets on Skyline's DataMiner Cloud Platform. The ticket number will be used by Skyline for the entire life cycle of the specific Issue or question.

To be able to assist User in an efficient manner, when generating a ticket or calling Skyline's helpdesk, User is required, to provide the following information: (a) a general description of the operating environment, (b) a list of all hardware components, operating systems and networks, (c) a reproducible test case, and (d) any log files, trace and systems files. The User's failure to provide this information may prevent Skyline from identifying and fixing the Issue.

## Proactive support

Skyline assumes that the Software is always cloud connected and that the Customer DataMiner Reporting tool ("**CDMR**") is permanently enabled. This allows User and Skyline to proactively react to occurrences before they may become critical.

## Exclusions

Skyline shall have no obligation of any kind to provide Support for Issues caused by or arising out of any of the following (each, a "**User-Generated Issue**"):

- modifications to the Software not made by Skyline;
- lack of training to correctly use the Software, including faulty configurations or settings made or manipulated by User;
- interference between the Software and other third-party software, such as for example Anti-virus software;
- Software connectors that have not been developed by Skyline;
- IP network failures or other network issues not caused by, or related to, the Software;
- versions of the Software that are not supported;
- when CDMR or cloud connectivity is disabled;
- Insufficient hardware, data computing or storage resources to run the Software, as compared to the advice provided by Skyline in that respect. Such advice shall take into account the minimum system specifications published by Skyline but shall also consider the exact nature and use of the application at hand, which may justify the need for higher specifications.
- Any external circumstance out of Skyline's control (e.g., remote access unavailable).

If Skyline determines that an Issue is a User-Generated Issue, Skyline will notify User as soon as reasonably possible. If User requests Support for the User-Generated Issue via a confirming email, Skyline shall have the right to invoice User at Skyline's then current time and materials rates for any such Support provided by Skyline.

## Pricing - Term

Except if agreed otherwise in writing, this Agreement shall commence on the date indicated on Skyline's proposal for Support Services and shall continue in effect for a period of 1 year.

Skyline will provide User a renewal proposal for the Support Services no later than three (3) months prior to the end- or anniversary date of the Agreement.

Unless User provides Skyline a written notice no later than thirty (30) days prior to the end- or anniversary date of the Agreement of its wish not to renew the Agreement, this Agreement shall automatically be renewed for successive periods of 1 year, and Skyline shall invoice the amount of the renewal proposal to User.

All amounts due to Skyline are payable up front before the provision of any Support Services. Early termination of the Support Services by the User does not entitle User to a refund.

## Data protection

To the extent that Skyline processes personal data on behalf of the User in performing the Support Services, Skyline shall process such personal data only for the purpose of the Support Services and shall take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect such personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing to prevent accidental loss, destruction, damage, alteration or disclosure. Skyline may employ its employees, affiliates and third parties worldwide in the performance of Support Services provided that Skyline shall remain primary responsible to User. This may involve a transfer of personal data outside of the European Economic Area if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:

- the personal data is transferred to a country that is recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection in relation to the data that is transferred, or
- a processing agreement that incorporates the standard model contractual clauses for data transfers approved by the European Commission is executed between the applicable parties.

## Various

All Support Services are provided in the English language. Other languages may be possible but are not guaranteed and are provided on a best effort basis.

These Support Services terms are always supplementary to and conditional upon the acceptance of Skyline's end-user license agreement for Skyline's Software ("**EULA**") or any other license agreement(s) concluded between the Parties.

## Schedule 1: Support Plan

### Precedence

In the event of conflict between the Support Services Terms and this Schedule 1 – Continuity, then the provisions of this Schedule 1 – Continuity shall prevail in relation to the clauses contained in the Support Services Terms.

### Issue priorities

Tickets for Issues will be processed based on their priority level. Skyline shall assign a priority level to an Issue after assessing the information provided by User. Skyline may in good faith change the priority level of an Issue at a later time if it does not conform anymore to the criteria for the selected priority level. Priority level designation is based on the availability and usability of the Software for the User.

The following priority levels shall be distinguished:

**Level 1 priority**: a condition where an occurrence renders the Software entirely unavailable for User, and no workaround is available. This includes for example a complete outage of the Software.

**Level 2 priority**: a condition where an occurrence partly renders the Software inoperative for User (possibly solved by means of workarounds or fallback mechanisms).

**Level 3 priority**: A condition where an occurrence affects the Software but does not have a significant operational impact for the User (possibly solved by means of workarounds or fallback mechanisms).

### Response and Corrective times

Depending on the Priority Level of a ticket, Skyline will address the ticket within the time frames set out below. Response Time will commence once the ticket for the Issue has been created by User. Corrective Time will commence once Skyline is able to reproduce the Issue. Corrective Time does not include the time when the Issue is on status "Awaiting Customer Input" or "Corrective Action Proposed". When the Corrective Action consists of an action plan, it shall always conclude the planned next steps, required User actions and if possible, a timeline for the next steps.

#### Continuity plan

| Priority Level | Availability   | Response Time     | Corrective Time   |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Level 1        | Business Hours | 1 Business Hour   | 12 Business Hours |
| Level 2        | Business Hours | 8 Business Hours  | 16 Business Hours |
| Level 3        | Business Hours | 24 Business Hours | N/A               |

#### Evolve plan

| Priority Level | Availability   | Response Time     | Corrective Time   |

| Level 3        | Business Hours | 8 Business Hours  | N/A               |

### Failures

In the event of a Failure, the following procedure shall apply: (i) User shall inform Skyline in writing of the Failure within three (3) business days of the alleged Failure, (ii) Skyline shall investigate the alleged Failure and inform User in writing of its acceptance or non-acceptance of the alleged Failure, (iii) User shall provide reasonable assistance to Skyline in its efforts to correct any problems or processes inhibiting Skyline's ability to reach the time frames and if the Failure by Skyline is proved, (iv) Skyline shall credit 0.25 % of the Support Services fee for the impacted licenses to User, subject to a maximum of 5% of the yearly Support Services fee.

The credit for Failures stated in this Failures section shall be User's sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any alleged or actual Failure.

### Out of business hours support

When User has purchased Out of Business Hours Support as part of the Support Services, Skyline shall also provide Support for Level 1 Priority Issues out of Business Hours.

Support for Level 1 Priority Issues out of Business Hours can requested by telephone only.

The following time frame shall apply for Issues reported during Out of Business Hours Support:

| Priority Level | Availability          | Response Time | Corrective Time |
|----------------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Level 1        | Out of Business Hours | 30 minutes    | 2 hours         |

### Evolve plan

This Evolve plan section shall only be applicable for Users that comply with the requirements of the Evolve plan. These requirements shall be tested for compliance at regular intervals. In case of non-compliance by the User, Skyline reserves the right to limit User's Support Services to the provisions of the Continuity plan.

#### Requirements

To be eligible for the Evolve Support Services plan, User is at all times required to:

- engage at least two (2) employees that hold a valid DataMiner Operator and Administrator certification issued by Skyline; and
- engage at least one (1) employee that holds a valid DataMiner DevOps certification issued by Skyline.

User shall ensure that the certified employees are formally mandated for DataMiner activities within User's organization to ensure mutually fruitful Support Services.

#### Customer success manager

A customer success manager from Skyline shall be at Users disposal to help User with any questions beyond the scope of Support Services and to help User to get the most out of the Software.

#### Professional Services Credits

In each one-year period of Support Services purchased by User, Professional Services Credits are granted to User. Allocated Professional Services Credits are dependent upon amounts spent for Support Services. The exact amount of granted Professional Services Credits will be communicated to User at the renewal time of the Support Services. More information on Professional Services Credits can be found on [DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/service-credits/).

Professional Services Credits are subject to availability and thus not guaranteed. User is recommended to timely schedule services that are to be performed using Professional Services Credits. Non-used portions of Professional Services Credits are not transferable to subsequent years.

#### Lab licenses

Upon User's request, Skyline will provide lab licenses of the Software to User. Such lab licenses may not be used in a production environment. The lab license(s) will be granted in Skyline's sole discretion, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
