# Out-of-business-hours support

Last-minute and planned work may require interventions outside of business hours. When subscribing to Support Services, users have the option to extend the service to out-of-business-hours support or to request this service ad hoc for such interventions.

"Last-minute work" means **level 1 priority** issues with an **impact on the system**. The corrective work done for these issues focuses on minimizing their impact on the software and on the system.

> [!NOTE]
> Out-of-business-hours support is available for level 1 priority issues and planned intervention work. For more information, see [Support services terms](xref:Support_services_terms).

## Out-of-business-hours subscription

When a user subscribes to this service, Skyline will produce a detailed document describing the system implemented to equip the team working outside of business hours with the necessary information to best assist the user in case of planned or last-minute interventions.

The user then gets access to a **dedicated 24/7 hotline** and can get support over the phone 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.

- **Guaranteed service** for last-minute interventions.
- Reduced [service fee](https://community.dataminer.services/service-credits/) for **planned interventions**.

## Ad hoc out-of-business-hours services

There is no additional subscription cost, but service fees are charged for the on-demand use of these services.

Planned interventions are also **available without an active out-of-business-hours subscription**. However, it is not possible to guarantee response or corrective time for last-minute interventions.
