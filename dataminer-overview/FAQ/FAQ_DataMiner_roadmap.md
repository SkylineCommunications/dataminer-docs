# What is the DataMiner roadmap?

The foundation of DataMiner is based on four strategic pillars that each have a roadmap driving continuous innovation.

1. **The ability to process any volume and any kind of data originating from any source element, regardless of the type of managed product, equipment supplier, or API technology**

   This is the foundation of a multi-vendor system. Skyline Communications has a roadmap to continuously invest in the integration of new APIs. Proof of this is the current library of 7000 off-the-shelf product integrations, which is growing on a weekly basis.

   Not only does DataMiner integrate with APIs of traditional hardware products, the platform also seamlessly interfaces with any software system deployed in a private data center or deployed as network and media functions (NFV/MFV) in the public cloud (multi-cloud).

   DataMiner manages the physical infrastructure (PNI), layers of virtualization (VNI) such as virtual machines, but also containers, applications, and microservices.

   DataMiner pushes the boundaries of the industry as a result of its ability to connect to any function in the environment, which is the foundation of a truly unified management and operations system.

1. **Automation and orchestration to manage service life cycles in today's hybrid media and IT environments**

   DataMiner Service & Resource Management (SRM) is a unique orchestration suite that offers unlimited automation and resource management across any infrastructure. Using DataMiner SRM, operators can plan any service ahead of time while resting assured that the network and processing behind it will deliver the necessary capacity. In case of shortage of capacity, DataMiner can even be instructed to deploy additional capacity on demand in the private or public cloud.

   DataMiner Service & Resource Management is available on the market today, but also has a continued roadmap, so that the technology can be used in any aspect of media, data and broadband applications.

1. **Seamless integration of operational workflows (OSS) with the underlying technology (NMS), resulting in efficient operations and utilization of network infrastructure as well as high service availability**

   The third roadmap of DataMiner focuses entirely on connecting the OSS with NMS functions. Integrated workflows include automated ticket creation and handling, support for planned maintenance activities, integration with billing systems, job and work order management system, and much more to come, including cloud sharing services that span across partners in the media and broadband supply chain.

1. **Artificial intelligence to help operators deal with the complexity of today's ecosystems**

   Skyline Communications and its customers strongly believe that today's ecosystems are becoming too complex to be managed solely with the power of the human brain.

   The DataMiner architecture is already big-data capable. A designated data science team of PhDs at Skyline communications continuously implements new and refined algorithms that detect patterns in the data originating from the network and consumers. They add autonomous learning to the system so that operations teams are augmented with AI-powered functions such as forecasting, incident detection, deep root cause analysis, proactive cap detection, dynamic dashboard creation, and much more.

   The continuous roadmap of innovation in the domain of artificial intelligence has already resulted in new technologies with patents pending.

Continuous innovation and roadmap execution lie at the basis of the success of DataMiner. The rate of adoption of the platform in the industry is extraordinary: more than 9000 DataMiner systems are deployed with over 1500 customers in more than 125 countries. DataMiner has also been awarded [many product and technology awards](xref:Overview_About_Skyline#awards). Like no other, Skyline Communications is committed to continuing innovation on the core DataMiner platform. This level of innovation creates the basis for DataMiner to excel in applications for monitoring and orchestration of the most complex ecosystems including media and broadband data centers, hybrid fiber/satellite exchange networks, all-IP broadcast infrastructures for remote production, playout and master control, multi-cloud and containerized media distribution systems for service providers, content providers and OTT, and much more.
