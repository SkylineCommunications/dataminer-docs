# Questions related to DataMiner Support Services

- **What is APA?**

  Annual Price Adjustment (APA): Automatic adjustment of sales prices reflecting current market conditions and actual cost evolutions.

- **What is APA for the current year?**

  Set by default globally at xx % (refer to Skyline Communications’ quotation for the current value)

- **Why the APA?**

  Today, we live in a rapidly changing world causing unprecedented volatile times and a general global upwards trend in the cost of goods and services all around us. It goes without saying that, as an organization, you have to deal with these already on a daily basis. As a result, the internal organizational costs are rising up significantly and to secure a long-term future several measures need to be taken.

  This is no different for Skyline Communications. Just like any other professional organization we are today forced to apply an Annual Price Adjustment (APA) (charged as a percentage on top of the pricing of the year before), covering extra costs we are currently facing in the delivery of Support Services (such as inflation, amongst others). The APA is ***not*** an increase in Skyline Communications’ margin and for the successor year the APA will be re-evaluated reflecting the inflation of that period and communicated timely to you.

  If needed, and based on a mutual agreement, we offer an alternative by opting for a multi-year agreement where we can lock the prices at a proposed rate in return for a full PO and a full pre-payment for the entire period.
