# Questions related to commercial models

- **Can different commercial models exist in the same organization?**

  Yes. Licensing is at DataMiner System level. An organization can have a system based on the perpetual model and another based on usage.

- **Can I transition my perpetual licenses into subscription?**

  Yes. Get in touch with [your Account Manager](https://community.dataminer.services/get-in-touch/sales-team/).

- **Are there any sign-up fees or one-time fees?**

  No.

- **How is monthly usage of "data collection and control plane" calculated?**

  The sum of the maximum number of active Managed Objects (for Managed Objects with 100+ metrics) and metrics (Managed Objects under 100 metrics) at any given time. Metering follows the 95% percentile (i.e. maximum usage after skipping the peak 5% usage), in practice allowing some room (36h per month) for tests or bursts of usage.

- **What level of support is included in usage-based services?**

  See [DataMiner Support Services](xref:Overview_Support_DMS_M_and_S).

- **Is outside business hours support available?**

  Yes, if you have subscribed to that service.

- **Can I use Professional Services credits to pay for usage-based service credits?**

  No.
