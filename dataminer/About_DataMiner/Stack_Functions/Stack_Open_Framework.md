## User-Defined APIs

Create RESTful APIs on the fly, tailored to your use case.

Select or create an Automation script, and with only a few clicks, you can publish that script as a RESTful API. DataMiner provides an API endpoint and manages the tokens to authenticate with any third-party system in a secure and easy manner.
