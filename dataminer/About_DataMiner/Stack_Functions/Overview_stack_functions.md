# DataMiner stack functions

A **modular architecture** allows for customization of modules and the addition of new functionality as needed, without complex integrations or upgrades. This flexibility enables operators to build a platform that **meets their unique needs** and **expand it to support new services or technologies**.

The DataMiner stack functions are the **foundation of your data-driven operation**. They offer unparalleled flexibility and make it easy to create powerful solutions by allowing you to **cherry-pick the building blocks you need**. Plus, their modular architecture lets you build a **scalable** operation and integrate with third-party applications and services. This gives you the flexibility to create better, faster, and cheaper solutions.

The stack functions are grouped in **several categories**:

- The [**dataminer.services**](xref:Overview_dataminer_services) category includes all the functions you get access to when your DataMiner System is connected to dataminer.services.

- The [**Orchestration**](xref:Stack_Orchestration) category offers powerful automation and orchestration functions, to maximize efficiency.

- The [**Data Management**](xref:Stack_Data_Management) category offers functions to easily manage, protect, and enrich your data flows.

- The [**Augmented Operations**](xref:Stack_Augmented_Operations) category leverages big data and AI to ensure maximum uptime.

- The [**Data Visualization**](xref:Stack_Data_Visualization) category converts bits and bytes into uncluttered dashboards and easy control panels.

- The [**Infrastructure Discovery & Provisioning**](xref:Stack_IDP) category offers functions to manage and automate all your network implementation workflows.

- The [**DataMiner Object Models (DOM)**](xref:Stack_DOM) category offers functions to enrich your operations with administrative and business-related data.

- The [**Open Framework**](xref:Stack_Open_Framework) category enables easy and secure integration with data from any source or system.

- The [**Data Connectivity**](xref:Stack_Data_Connectivity) category offers functions to configure and visualize signal paths throughout your infrastructure.

- The [**Data Aggregation**](xref:Stack_Data_Aggregation) category offers functions to merge complex data streams into actionable insights.

- The [**Service Management**](xref:Stack_SLA_Management) category offers functions to reduce operational expenses and ensure that business stakes are always taken into account.

- The [**Third-Party Integrations**](xref:Stack_Third_Party_Integrations) category allows you to work more efficiently by using the tools you already know and love.
