# Orchestration

The Orchestration stack, also known as the **DataMiner Service and Resource Management (SRM)** stack, focuses on **maximizing efficiency with powerful automation and orchestration**.

DataMiner SRM empowers ICT media and broadband teams with a versatile toolset tailored to their orchestration and automation needs. As there are no out-of-the-box one-size-fits-all automation and orchestration solutions, DataMiner allows DevOps engineers to cherry-pick the right tool for the right job, creating value in the fastest possible manner.

DataMiner supports **four different use cases** that can flexibly be combined within or across workflows:

- [Resource Scheduling](xref:srm_resource_scheduling): Keeping track of all resource schedules without automating actions, for maximum flexibility.
- [Resource Automation](xref:srm_resource_automation): Intelligent resource configuration with a click of a button.
- [Resource Orchestration](xref:srm_resource_orchestration): The power of Resource Scheduling combined with automatic configuration actions at the start and end time of bookings.
- [Service Orchestration](xref:srm_service_orchestration): Orchestration of the complete lifecycle of services.

Each of the four DataMiner SRM use cases described above relies on a **combination of different DataMiner modules**, as detailed below.

- **[Scheduling Engine](xref:srm_stack#scheduling-engine)**: Manage scheduled tasks in an automated way.

- **[Resource Manager](xref:srm_stack#resource-manager)**: Streamline and standardize the management of your resources.

- **[Automation Engine](xref:srm_stack#automation-engine)**: Open-architecture, fully user-definable automation engine.

- **[Profile Manager](xref:srm_stack#profile-manager)**: Configure complex resources repeatedly and reliably.

- **[Virtualization Engine](xref:srm_stack#virtualization-engine)**: Replace network appliance hardware with virtual machines or containers.

- **[Network Manager](xref:srm_stack#network-manager)**: Calculate the paths across any network, independently from the technology and vendor used for that network.

- **[Service Manager](xref:srm_stack#service-manager)**: Add a full-fledged service layer on top of your individual resources, allowing quick creation of services, full automation of the entire service lifecycle, and enhanced visibility of service quality and SLAs.

- **Apps**: Out-of-the-box standard application for specific tech domains, such as the [Booking Manager](xref:Booking_Manager_user_interface) app, which allows you to create and manage bookings using DataMiner Service & Resource Management (SRM), the [DataMiner IDP](xref:SolIDP) (Infrastructure Discovery and Provisioning) app and the [DataMiner PTP](xref:SolPTP) (Precision Time Protocol) app.
