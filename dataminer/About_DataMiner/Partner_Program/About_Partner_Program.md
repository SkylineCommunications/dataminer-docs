# About the Partner Program

At Skyline we value the collaboration with our partners and your commitment and contributions to create value for end customers. Our Partner Program is designed to recognize and reward you for the value your technical and business skills add to the market.

In essence: **the greater the engagement, the greater the discount**.

We ensure that your efforts are recognized from the day our partnership journey begins:

- Structured discount on DataMiner licenses, usage-based services, and support services

- Early access to roadmap discussions

- Referrals

- Access to go-to-market strategies

- Access to tooling/partner portal

- Partner-exclusive events throughout the year

## Partnership levels

Your engagement is rewarded with DataMiner credits, recognizing your expertise and collaboration. The number of credits obtained in a calendar year determines your partnership level, which remains valid from the moment you earn it until the end of the following year.

Today there are three core partnership levels:

- Member (bronze level)

- Collaborator (silver level, as of 25 credits)

- Creator (gold level, as of 75 credits)

A partner can obtain these levels based on business skills, technical skills, or both.

## Rewards

Your skill level allows you to buy DataMiner Licenses, DataMiner credits, and Support Services at discounted rates. The discount rates vary with your skill Level.

*For example: As a partner, you achieved the Technical Creator level, while also having the Business Collaborator level. To determine your Base Discount, we look at the highest level, which in this example is the Technical Creator level.*

The credits you accumulate serve a dual purpose. Not only do they allow you to achieve higher skill levels, you can also translate them to commercial value:

- Sales transactions: Use credits to reduce software license or usage-based services (DataMiner credits) prices when selling to customers, in addition to your level's Base Discounts.

- Self-use: reduce your subscriptions costs, training, and certifications.

> [!NOTE]
> The total number of credits utilized in any given order cannot exceed 5% of the DataMiner Licenses or Usage-based Services ordered for an end customer, 25% of DataMiner credits when ordering for self-use (e.g. setting up a lab or a demo system), or 50% for your training and certifications.
