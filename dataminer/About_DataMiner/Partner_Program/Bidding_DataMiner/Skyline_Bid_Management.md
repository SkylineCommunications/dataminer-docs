# Skyline bid management

This page provides an overview of the Skyline bid management workflow, detailing how tender opportunities are identified, evaluated, approved, submitted, and monitored.

It incorporates both internal processes and partner-specific actions and responsibilities, providing a comprehensive overview of the workflow, clarifying roles, and ensuring alignment between all parties involved.

## Workflow

1. Tender opportunity identification: Identify or receive a tender opportunity through the partner portal. Direct email submission should be rejected and redirected to the partner portal.

1. Preliminary evaluation: Assess eligibility, risks, and alignment with the business strategy. Decide whether to proceed or decline (Go/No-Go).

1. Partner notification & coordination: Inform the involved partners, align responsibilities, and schedule a kickoff meeting.

1. Tender document analysis: Review the tender requirements, create a compliance matrix, and follow up on uncertainties with the issuer.

1. Solution design & proposal development: Prepare the technical solution, pricing, and required documentation in collaboration with partners.

1. Internal review & approval: Conduct a full internal review of the proposal. Legal, financial, and commercial approval are required.

1. Partner review & final alignment: Share the draft with partners, incorporate their feedback, and finalize the submission materials.

1. Tender submission: Submit the final tender response via the designated method (portal, email, etc.).

1. Post-submission monitoring: Track progress, respond to any clarifications, and maintain communication with partners.

1. Award notification & next steps: Communicate the results. If awarded, initiate the contract process. If not, conduct a debrief if relevant.

## Timeline

Each cycle necessitates expert input to ensure optimal preparation prior to final submission. Accordingly, steps 1 through 8 generally require an average time frame of 4 to 6 weeks to complete.

While the bid management team at Skyline aims to operate as efficiently as possible, timelines may vary at different times in the year depending on the number of active tenders.

To help ensure support for your tender submission, please inform us and upload all relevant documents as early as reasonably possible.
