# Deal Registration - Business Development Reward

The purpose of the Deal Registration is to help achieve a fruitful cooperation between Skyline and its partners by outlining the terms of engagement between the parties.

This includes, among others, the roles and responsibilities of the parties, as well as the relationship between different partners.

Partners of Skyline that wish to earn a **Business Development Reward** are expected to respect and comply with these terms of qualification.

This Partnership Program aims to increase transparency between the Parties and create a level playing field for partners that develop opportunities to sell Skyline Products.

> [!NOTE]
> The term **“partner”** is used for any third-party company or individual that has a written agreement in place with Skyline that allows them to resell Skyline’s software to end users.

## The program

### Program workflow

- Identification

- Registration

- Growing

- Successful business transaction

### Opportunity identification

Partners are encouraged to actively identify new opportunities for the sales of Skyline products. Opportunities are new business opportunities for the sales of Skyline products only.

When partners identify an opportunity, they are invited to register this using the [Deal Registration form](https://community.dataminer.services/deal-registration-form/) on DataMiner Dojo.

> [!NOTE]
> Filing an opportunity will never grant any kind of exclusivity to a partner for the filed opportunity.

A filed opportunity proves that the partner discovered the business opportunity and filed it on Skyline’s CRM platform. This is a primary and essential step in securing a Business Development Reward for the Opportunity.

### Opportunity Lifecycle

#### Opportunity Status

A registered opportunity will be granted one of the following active statuses:

- **Lead**: The opportunity has been identified, but no business development has been done. There has been no contact with the end customer or no contacts have been found yet.

- **Engaged**: The opportunity has been identified and contact has been made with the end customer.

- **Confirmed**: The customer has confirmed their interest in purchasing Skyline products in writing.

- **Quoted**: The partner has provided the end customer with a written sales offer.

- **Negotiating**: The partner is negotiating the sales offer with the end customer.

- **Waiting PO**: The partner has accepted the sales offer.  

If an opportunity is not active (anymore), it will be given one of the following statuses:

- **Cold**: The opportunity has been temporarily postponed, but the partner expects that it will be relaunched sometime in the future.

- **Closed Won**: The opportunity has been won by the partner.

- **Closed Lost**: The opportunity has been lost by the partner.

- **Closed Dropped**: Skyline has decided that the opportunity is not a good fit for Skyline products.

#### Opportunity Expiration Flow

Skyline encourages partners to actively pursue opportunities. To avoid growing a large list of unused or inactive opportunities, the following applies for filed opportunities with status *Lead* and *Engaged*:

|**Status**|**Expire**|**Meaning**|
|--|--|--|
| Lead | 30 days after registering the opportunity, the opportunity will expire and be removed from the list unless the partner can demonstrate and prove that they are in fact still actively pursuing the opportunity and making reasonable and continuous attempts to get in touch with the right people, to get the conversation going. In this case, the deadline will be extended by another 30 days. | The opportunity has been identified, but no contact with the customer has been made. Follow up on the opportunity to secure your eligibility for a potential Business Development Reward. |
| Engaged | 90 days after the opportunity's status was changed to *Engaged*, the opportunity will expire and be removed from the list unless the partner can demonstrate and prove that they are in fact undertaking reasonable and continuous actions to further develop the opportunity and to move it forward in the pipeline towards securing the business. | An opportunity's status changes from *Lead* to *Engaged* as soon there is active contact with the customer. Conversations are being held about the opportunity and the partner provides proof of that. |

> [!NOTE]
> "Business development" entails at a minimum a report about one of the following activities: a meeting, an introduction to Skyline personnel, an exhibition meeting, or a webinar. Other business development activities may be accepted by Skyline at its sole and reasonable discretion.

### Qualification as a registered opportunity

An opportunity with the status *Engaged* or *Confirmed* becomes a registered opportunity linked to the first partner that entered the opportunity in the SLC CRM system. The registered opportunity status is temporarily granted to a partner who is taking a continuous leading role in developing the DataMiner business opportunity.

In case Skyline products offered are a smaller part of a larger offered ecosystem (Product X,Y,Z + DataMiner), the offered DataMiner System is unique and linked to the offered ecosystem, meaning there is no competing bid in the market and no unique Deal Registration possible.

The qualification as a registered opportunity is a qualification that refers to the partner’s compensation. It means that the partner, subject to their compliance with the rules, will be granted their partner commission or discount as set out in their commercial agreement with Skyline in case of a successful business transaction. This will also be the case if their registered opportunity is eventually won by another partner, provided that the offers to the end customer were identical.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To maintain the qualification of registered opportunity, a partner must report a business development activity to Skyline at least once per month. A registered opportunity will become obsolete if it has not transformed into a successful business transaction within 12 months from the day it became a Registered Opportunity.

### The successful business transaction

If the opportunity results in a successful business transaction, the partner will be eligible for their partner commission or discount as set out in their commercial agreement with Skyline.

If the opportunity results in a successful business transaction for Skyline, but the partner has lost the opportunity to a competitor, the Business Development Reward will be provided to the partner by Skyline acknowledging the partner’s business efforts if the opportunity is marked as registered.

### Withdrawal

The partner can, at any point in time, withdraw an opportunity for any reason. If the opportunity was withdrawn by the partner, they are no longer entitled to a Business Development Reward.

### The Partner Success Manager

Skyline’s Partner Success Manager (PSM) will act as the first point of contact for partners. The primary goal of this person is to help partners with the implementation of the Partnership Program and during the lifecycle of opportunities.

> [!TIP]
> The Partner Success Manager can be reached via [psm@skyline.be](mailto:psm@skyline.be).

### Deviations

Skyline understands that every business situation is different, and exceptions to the rules might therefore be required. For such exceptions you must obtain written agreement from Skyline, who will use reasonable judgement to determine if the exception is applicable.
