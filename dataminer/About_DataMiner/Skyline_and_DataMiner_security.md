# Skyline Communications and DataMiner security

At Skyline Communications, security is a core value. Skyline is committed to providing a flexible, secure, and reliable platform.

## Skyline Communications security

The security of the DataMiner platform starts with the security posture of Skyline Communications itself. This is why Skyline continuously invests in strengthening its internal security practices. To demonstrate this commitment, it is working towards compliance with both the [NIS2 directive](xref:DataMiner_compliance_offering#nis2-and-cra-compliance) and the [ISO/IEC 27001 standard](xref:DataMiner_compliance_offering#isoiec-27001-compliance).

## DataMiner security

With DataMiner, you apply top-tier technology straight across your operation, bringing you a wealth of powerful off-the-shelf options to accelerate your digital transformation. DataMiner integrates seamlessly across vendors, technologies, and domains, reducing complexity and **minimizing the attack surface** compared to point-to-point integrations. However, this also means DataMiner's security has to be airtight.

That is why Skyline has a **dedicated security team** focusing exclusively on continuously improving its security stance across all possible aspects of its products. Their work evolves Skyline's products **in line with industry standards and regulatory frameworks** such as the [Cyber Resilience Act](xref:DataMiner_compliance_offering#nis2-and-cra-compliance). To validate these efforts and provide independent oversight, an external third party conducts [an extensive penetration test each year](xref:DataMiner_compliance_offering#annual-security-assessment) against the latest DataMiner version.

Using a secure platform is only the start of running secure operations. Proper **user management** is essential to keep access under control and limit privileges to what is strictly needed. DataMiner provides a flexible [user management system](xref:User_management), [fine-grained RBAC system](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions), and [multiple authentication options](xref:User_management#user-authentication) to support this. The platform also applies [strong encryption](xref:Encryption_in_DataMiner) to allow **secure integration with your operations**. It is also important to configure the system in a secure way and to maintain that configuration. To help with this, DataMiner has a complete [hardening guide](xref:DataMiner_hardening_guide) and accompanying, built-in [security analyzer](xref:BPA_Security_Advisory).

The **dataminer.services platform** is a vital part of the DataMiner ecosystem. It extends your DataMiner system's capabilities through a [secure cloud connection](xref:Cloud_connectivity_and_security) and offers managed features such as [Storage as a Service](xref:STaaS_features).
These cloud services are hosted on Microsoft Azure, ensuring [enterprise-grade security, availability, and compliance](xref:DataMiner_compliance_offering#azure-and-dataminerservices).
