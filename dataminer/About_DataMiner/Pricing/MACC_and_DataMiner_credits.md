# Maximizing your azure investments with MACC and DataMiner credits

([DataMiner credits](xref:Pricing_Usage_based_service#usage-terms)) can be conveniently obtained from the following sources:

- Skyline Communications ([contact us](https://www.skyline.be/contact/))
- DataMiner Business Partners (see [Partners](https://community.dataminer.services/partners/) on DataMiner Dojo)
- Microsoft Azure Marketplace ([Microsoft Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/skylinecommunicationsnv1644148291022.dataminer?tab=Overview))

When DataMiner credits are procured through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, they are eligible for any of the dataminer.services offerings, including DataMiner as a Service (DaaS) and Storage as a Service (STaaS) services.

## DataMiner: your MACC-eligible partner

DataMiner is an official Microsoft Internal Azure IP Co-Sell partner, having achieved MACC Eligible status. This designation means that any organization with an active Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC) can utilize their commitment to procure DataMiner credits. These credits can be used for any dataminer.services offerings, such as DataMiner As a Service (DaaS) and Storage As a Service (StaaS).

## Understanding MACC: maximizing your Azure investment

A Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC) is a contractual agreement between your organization and Microsoft to spend a specified amount on Azure services over a set period. This commitment provides several tangible benefits:

1. **Financial commitment**: Your organization agrees to spend a predetermined amount on Azure services within a specified timeframe, aiding in budgeting and planning your cloud expenditures.
1. **Cost efficiency**: All Azure benefit-eligible offers purchased through the Azure Marketplace contribute 100% of the pretax purchase amount toward your organization’s commitment. This ensures every eligible purchase maximizes your overall Azure spending.
1. **Tracking and management**: You can track your MACC commitment, including start and end dates, remaining commitment, and eligible spending, through the Azure portal or REST APIs. This visibility helps manage and optimize your cloud resources effectively.
1. **Flexibility**: The MACC program allows you to adapt your spending based on your organization’s needs, with pay-as-you-go billing for most services.
1. **Simplified procurement**: By consolidating your purchases under a single commitment, the MACC program reduces administrative overhead and simplifies tracking and management of your software usage.

## A win-win situation

As an organization with an active MACC, it is crucial to meet your commitment to avoid financial penalties, loss of discounts, impacts on future agreements, and administrative overhead.
