# The DataMiner DevOps Creative Collective

The DataMiner DevOps Creative Collective is dedicated to fostering a dynamic open community of DataMiner DevOps Professionals and creative thinkers, a collective that aims at empowering people to unlock the full potential of the DataMiner platform through collaborative innovation, with the goal of maximizing their value output.

By uniting DevOps and creativity, we aim to drive innovation, elevate skill sets, and enrich the DataMiner ecosystem, ultimately making a positive impact on the world of data-driven operations and beyond.

From a practical perspective, the DataMiner DevOps Creative Collective revolves around so-called [DataMiner Solutions](xref:DataMiner_Solutions), which are managed by a [Solution Product Owner](xref:Solution_Product_Owner). The latter manages the DataMiner Solution by leveraging [Agile methodologies](xref:Agile_Methodologies) and ensures alignment with the [core values](xref:Core_Values) and [recommended policies](xref:Recommended_Policies) of the DataMiner DevOps Creative Collective.
