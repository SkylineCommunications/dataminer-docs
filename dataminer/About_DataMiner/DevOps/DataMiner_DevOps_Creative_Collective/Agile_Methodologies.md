# Agile best practices for DataMiner Solution Product Owners

As outlined in the [responsibilities of a Solution Product Owner](xref:Solution_Product_Owner), the PO must apply Agile principles and methodologies to manage the Solution and to optimize its value.

- **Maximize value**: Manage your time expenditure wisely. Aim for early delivery. Think goal-oriented. Innovate. Etc.

- **Collect quality user input**: What is really needed? What is it that users really want to achieve and what will make them love your solution?

- **Build up a backlog**: Collect thoughts, ideas, and suggestions to obtain a broad view of the available options and to choose the best options to deliver maximum value in the next iteration.

- **Limit Work In Progress (WIP)**: Maintain a focus on delivering value in a continuous manner, prioritizing the completion of ongoing work to the point of concrete, evidenced value delivery before starting on new work (i.e. Stop starting and start finishing!).

- **Early exposure to users**: Share initial concepts and previews during the development phase to collect early feedback.

- **Smallest independent team possible**: "Me, myself, and I" is the leanest, meanest, and most agile team. The more people involved, the more overhead and complexity is added, resulting in lower efficiency.

- **Short iterations**: Keep iterations short, with early deliveries and feedback opportunities.

- **Transparency - Proactive communication**: Inform people about upcoming initiatives to maximize transparency and minimize development risks.
