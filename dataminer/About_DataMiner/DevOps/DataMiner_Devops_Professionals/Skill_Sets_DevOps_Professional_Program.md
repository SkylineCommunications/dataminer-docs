# Expectations

As we live in a rapidly evolving technology landscape, **continuous learning** is the new normal. Therefore, a passion and ability to absorb new knowledge are more important than your specific existing skill sets. The essential thing is to continuously work on evolving your existing skill sets as well as to acquire new ones. These can be skill sets related to DataMiner itself or other associated skills.

## Skill sets to consider

If you are considering becoming a DataMiner DevOps Professional, or if you are setting up a team of DataMiner DevOps Professionals as an organization, system integrator, or consultancy house, these are the main skill sets to consider:

- **New world mindset**: Knowledge of and experience with agile methodologies, value delivery, objectives and key results, continuous learning, being community-oriented, empowering people, etc.

- **Domain knowledge & expertise**: Knowledge of and experience within your specific vertical, e.g. satellite, OTT, contribution, data centers, media, energy, HFC, security, IP, cloud, IoT, etc.

- **General ICT concepts & architecture knowledge**: Knowledge of and experience with general concepts and technology related to CI/CD, automation and orchestration, process modeling, object modeling, IP networking, KQI engineering, coding, actionable insights, unit testing, data storage, cloud, etc.

- **DataMiner knowledge & expertise**: Knowledge of and expertise in leveraging DataMiner, which could be focused on specific areas such as data ingest, resource control, digital twin modeling, automation and orchestration, process automation, user experience and control surface design, etc.

## Setting up a continuous learning program

For organizations seeking to set up a team of DataMiner DevOps Professionals, it is important to establish a **continuous learning program** so they can evolve their existing skill sets and acquire new ones. Skill sets should not necessarily be achieved through a single individual, but rather by a team. In a typical organization, you are looking at setting up an autonomous squad of up to maximum 8 individuals, working towards well-defined goals. Hence, skill sets can also be **considered at squad level**.

Skill sets can also be quite broad if considered in a more generalized context and widen day by day. Therefore, it is also important to consider and **prioritize** the skills that apply most to your business, your operation, your existing teams, your strategy and goals, etc.

The spectrum of so-called ICT and software skills is continuously expanding. This no longer solely revolves around software coding and scripting. While the latter is still part of the overall skill set (attributed to the team), technology evolutions such as no-code development and data-engineering tools, among others, have broadened the number of people that can be considered candidates to strengthen your DataMiner DevOps Professionals team.
