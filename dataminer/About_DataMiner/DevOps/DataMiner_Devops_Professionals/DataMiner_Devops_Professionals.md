# DataMiner DevOps Professional Program

Tomorrow revolves all around **building a powerful, agile, data-driven operation**. This to empower teams with actionable data and insights, and to leverage automation and orchestration across the business to drive efficiency and accelerate innovation. After all, every business needs and wants *better*, *faster*, and *cheaper*.

While DataMiner is a key strategic technology that delivers exactly that, success is also very much conditional on succeeding at designing an agile organization that wraps around the actual technology stack and derives maximum value from it. In that context, DataMiner DevOps Professionals play a vital role.

The **DataMiner DevOps Professional Program** is centered around empowered people embedded in an operation: People knowledgeable about DataMiner and all its powerful modular functions, but also knowledgeable about the specifics of the overall operation and the goals and ambitions of the business. In other words, the program focuses on people that can iterate quickly and convert their finite time into tangible value for the business.
