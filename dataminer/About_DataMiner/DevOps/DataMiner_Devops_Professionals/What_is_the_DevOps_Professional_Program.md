For you as an individual, this program is all about boosting your personal value by investing in some of the most highly sought-after skill sets and cultural mindsets. As an officially accredited DataMiner DevOps Professional, you effectively hold the key to tap into the unlimited potential of virtualized, cloudified, data-littered ecosystems, and to convert it into very tangible value.

And a team of DataMiner DevOps Professionals is exactly all about that. Creating, nurturing, and empowering a team of DataMiner DevOps Professionals goes to the heart of what an operation is all about in the present era of all-IP, virtualized, and cloudified technologies.

### For solution providers

As a system integrator or consultancy enterprise, the key value proposition is to be able to identify the needs of organizations and to develop innovative end-to-end workflows that tap into the full potential of current and emerging technology. DataMiner DevOps Professionals provide you with the means to make this a reality. They enable your organization to imagine and create its own unique innovative solution offering, and to convert it into a tangible deliverable for your customers, either through consultancy and engineering services or your very own solution portfolio and intellectual property.
