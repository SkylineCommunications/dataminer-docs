# Benefits for DataMiner business and technology partners

By creating DataMiner business value and market presence, you earn DevOps Points.

Not only do these points determine your [DevOps Professional level](xref:DevOps_Points), they also allow you to enjoy the plentiful benefits attached to the DevOps Professional Program.

> [!NOTE]
> We are continuously working on further evolving this key program, so new benefits or ways of collecting DevOps Points can be expected.

As a DataMiner Business Partner or DataMiner Technology Partner, by default you are eligible to all [general DevOps Points](xref:DevOps_Points).

In addition to these general DevOps Points, as a partner you also gain DevOps Points from engaging in business activities. You can transfer the points you have earned to DOJO points and use them to pay for personal or professional benefits (i.e. swap them for professional service credits or DataMiner credits ([DataMiner Swag Shop](https://community.dataminer.services/swag-shop/))).

As a business or technology partner you can accumulate DataMiner DevOps Points by:

- **Scheduling an in-person meeting with Skyline professionals during an exhibition/show**: When you officially schedule a meeting at our booth before the show, and the meeting effectively takes place, you will receive 500 DevOps Points per meeting.

  For example, if, as a business or technology partner, during the days before IBC you have scheduled 5 meetings at our booth with 2 people attending, and these 5 meetings effectively take place, after the show you will receive (500 DevOps Points/meeting x 5)/2, meaning that each of the people attending will collect 1,250 DevOps Points.

- **Scheduling a virtual meeting meeting with Skyline representatives and a customer**: When you initiate and schedule a virtual meeting with us and a customer, after the meeting you will receive 100 DevOps Points (divided by the number of attendees of the meeting).

- **Hosting/co-hosting a DataMiner Inspire or Empower "on tour" event**: Up to 1,000 DevOps Points/day (divided by the selected number of people).

- **Submitting a use case**: If you choose to [submit a use case](https://community.dataminer.services/download/use-case-template/) for the community, upon acceptance this will result in 250 up to 1000 points. Use cases could focus on a new product integration that you have completed for DataMiner, or on any other type of solution that you have implemented with DataMiner.

- **Enrolling in and completing online DataMiner Sales & Business Insights**: The DataMiner Community offers complimentary Corporate Business Value Proposition training. Watch the video presentation and successfully complete the quiz to be rewarded with 400 DevOps Points.
