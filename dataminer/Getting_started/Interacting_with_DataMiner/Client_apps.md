In addition to this, many [tools](xref:DataMinerTools) are available, such as the [Alerter app](xref:Accessing_Alerter) to get alarm notifications on your desktop, or the [DataMiner&nbsp;Taskbar Utility](xref:Accessing_the_DataMiner_Taskbar_Utility) for DataMiner administrators, and it is also possible to interact with DataMiner via the [DataMiner Web APIs](xref:Using_the_Web_Services_v1).

## DataMiner Cube

DataMiner Cube is the main DataMiner client application. With Cube, you can fully monitor and configure your DataMiner System. Most operators will mainly rely on this app.

- To use DataMiner Cube, you will need to [install it first](xref:Installing_the_DataMiner_Cube_desktop_application). Cube [requires a Windows environment](xref:DataMiner_Client_Requirements).

- Once you have installed Cube, you can [connect to your DataMiner System](xref:Connecting_to_a_DMA_with_Cube) or to any other DataMiner System you have access to.

## DataMiner web apps

The DataMiner web apps are a suite of applications, available on the [DataMiner landing page](xref:Accessing_the_web_apps#dataminer-landing-page), that allow users to interact with a DataMiner System. These include:

- **DataMiner Monitoring app**: The main web application for monitoring a DataMiner System. While it has more limited functionality than DataMiner Cube, it is more easily accessible, as you can open it in any modern browser.

- **Dashboards app and Low-Code Apps**: These modules allow the creation of custom dashboards and apps that provide access to specific information and functionality. This way, users will only see the data and features that they need for a specific purpose. For more information, see [Dashboards app and Low-Code Apps](xref:Dashboards_and_Low_Code_Apps).
