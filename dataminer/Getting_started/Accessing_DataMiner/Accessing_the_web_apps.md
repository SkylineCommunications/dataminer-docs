## DataMiner landing page

To access the DataMiner landing page:

1. In a supported web browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari), navigate to:

   ```txt
   https://[DMA]/root/
   ```

   Replace `[DMA]` with the IP address or hostname of the DataMiner Agent you want to connect to.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - If you are trying to use the remote access URL (e.g. `https://ziine-skyline.on.dataminer.services/root/`) to access the web apps, make sure you have been granted [remote access](xref:About_Remote_Access).
   > - System Administrators can [configure whether the landing page is displayed](xref:Configuring_the_landing_page#configuring-whether-the-landing-page-is-displayed) or whether the Monitoring app opens directly when a user browses to a DMA. If the Monitoring app opens directly, you can access the other web apps by clicking the icon in the top-left corner.

1. Sign in using your DataMiner credentials.

1. On the landing page, select the app you want to open. See [Available web apps](#available-web-apps).
