# Installing & configuring the DataMiner Cube software

DataMiner Cube is primarily used as a desktop application. If you browse to the IP or name of your DMA using Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge (without IE compatibility mode), Mozilla Firefox or Safari, by default a landing page is displayed where you can download the desktop application. See [Installing the DataMiner Cube desktop application](xref:Installing_the_DataMiner_Cube_desktop_application).

It is also possible to use Cube as a browser application, though this is not recommended. To access the browser application, browse to the IP or name of your DMA in a compatible browser. In the past, Internet Explorer was used for this, but now you can use Microsoft Edge in IE compatibility mode (see [Configuring Microsoft Edge to run DataMiner Cube](xref:Configuring_Microsoft_edge_to_run_Cube)) or Chrome with the [IE Tab extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ie-tab/hehijbfgiekmjfkfjpbkbammjbdenadd).

> [!NOTE]
> The desktop version of DataMiner Cube runs as a 64-bit process on 64-bit systems and as a 32-bit process on 32-bit systems. If DataMiner Cube is used as a browser application, it always runs as a 32-bit process.
