# Accessing DataMiner Cube

DataMiner Cube is the primary client app used to interact with a DataMiner System. You can install it from [dataminer.services](https://dataminer.services/) or from the landing page of your DataMiner System. For details about the installation, see [Installing DataMiner Cube](xref:Installing_the_DataMiner_Cube_desktop_application).

In most cases, when you [connect to a DataMiner Agent](xref:Connecting_to_a_DMA_with_Cube) with Cube, you will be logged on automatically with your current Windows account. For information on how to log on otherwise, refer to [Logging on to DataMiner Cube](xref:Logging_on_to_DataMiner_Cube).

While in earlier versions of DataMiner, prior to DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU12]/10.5.3, it is also possible to use Cube as a browser application (using [Microsoft Edge in IE compatibility mode](xref:Configuring_Microsoft_edge_to_run_Cube) or Chrome with the [IE Tab extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ie-tab/hehijbfgiekmjfkfjpbkbammjbdenadd)), this is no longer recommended.
