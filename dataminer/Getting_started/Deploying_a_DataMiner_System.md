# Deploying a DataMiner System

If you want to deploy a DataMiner System, you can choose between different approaches:

- **Create your DMS in the cloud**: Deploy a system using DataMiner as a Service (DaaS) [in just a few clicks](xref:Creating_a_DMS_on_dataminer_services). Your system will be fully hosted and maintained by Skyline Communications.

- **Install DataMiner** on premises, in a private cloud, or in a hybrid setup. With this approach, you **host and manage the DataMiner nodes yourself**.

  There are two ways you can do this:

  - The easiest way is to [install the DataMiner Agents using the DataMiner Installer](xref:Installing_DM_using_the_DM_installer).

  - If you are familiar with virtualization, you can instead download and deploy [virtual hard disk with DataMiner pre-installed](xref:Using_a_pre_installed_DataMiner_Virtual_Hard_Disk).

  When you install such a self-managed system, you will be able to choose between different options for the data storage of your system:

  - The easiest option is **[Storage as a Service (STaaS)](xref:STaaS)**. If you choose this, you will connect your DataMiner System to a scalable, easy-to-use, cloud-native storage platform hosted by Skyline.

  - Alternatively, you can host and **manage the storage yourself**. This means you will need to take care of [configuring and maintaining the databases](xref:Configuring_dedicated_clustered_storage).

  - If you want to **create a test setup**, you can install DataMiner by [deploying the pre-installed DataMiner Virtual Hard Disk](xref:Using_a_pre_installed_DataMiner_Virtual_Hard_Disk) and choose to deploy the storage databases (Cassandra and OpenSearch) locally on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). However, while this is easy to set up and allows you to get started immediately, it should only be used for **testing and staging environments**. Do not use this option for production systems. If you later decide to use such a system in production, you should switch the existing DataMiner System to one of the two setups above instead.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, a DataMiner System is deployed with a **Community Edition license**. For information on pricing and limitations for this license, see [DataMiner Community Edition](xref:Pricing_Commercial_Models#dataminer-community-edition).
