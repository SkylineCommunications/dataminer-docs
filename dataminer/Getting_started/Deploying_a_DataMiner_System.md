# Deploying a DataMiner System

If you want to deploy a DataMiner System, you can choose between the following approaches:

- [**Create your DMS in the cloud**](xref:Creating_a_DMS_on_dataminer_services): Deploy a system using DataMiner as a Service (DaaS) in just a few clicks. Your system will be fully hosted and maintained by Skyline Communications.

- [**Install a self-managed DataMiner Agent**](xref:Installing_a_DataMiner_Agent) on premises, in a private cloud, or in a hybrid setup. With this approach, you host and manage the DataMiner nodes yourself.
