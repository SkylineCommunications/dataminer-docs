# Getting started with the Dojo DataMiner Community platform

The Dojo DataMiner Community platform allows you to actively participate in the world-wide DataMiner community.

To access the Dojo DataMiner Community platform, go to <https://community.dataminer.services/>.

For some features of the platform, you will need to [log on to dataminer.services](xref:Logging_on_to_dataminer_services).

To get started, visit the following sections:

- [Blog](https://community.dataminer.services/blog/): Get info on a wide range of topics, including new and upcoming DataMiner features, DataMiner releases, and ongoing technology and industry changes.

- [Questions](https://community.dataminer.services/questions/): Ask and answer questions related to DataMiner or to the industry in general.

  > [!TIP]
  > If you want to ask a question, it will be easier for people to answer quickly if you try to make your question concise and clear. Try not to combine different topics in one question, because then you might only get a partial answer. Add screenshots if this will help to clarify what you mean, but be careful not to disclose any confidential information. Blur out parts of screenshots if necessary.

- [Learning](https://community.dataminer.services/learning/): Discover free courses and videos to develop and improve your DataMiner skills and learn about a wide variety of topics.
