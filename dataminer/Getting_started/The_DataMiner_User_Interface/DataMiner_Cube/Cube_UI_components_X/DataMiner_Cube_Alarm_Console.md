# DataMiner Cube Alarm Console

The Alarm Console is the section of the DataMiner Cube user interface that allows you to view and manage active alarms, historical alarms and information events. By default, it is available as a collapsible panel at the bottom of the user interface.

The Alarm Console is highly customizable: You can for instance configure which tabs it contains, what is displayed in them, and how it is displayed.

For more information on how to use the Alarm Console, see [Working with the Alarm Console](xref:Working_with_the_Alarm_Console).
