# Card pane

When you open an item in Cube, e.g. an element or an app, it is opened in a so-called card in the large, central pane of the Cube UI.

For more information, see [Working with cards in DataMiner Cube](xref:Working_with_cards_in_DataMiner_Cube).

## Card header bar buttons

At the top of each card, there can be several buttons:
