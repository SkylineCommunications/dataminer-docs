# Desktop application command-line arguments

When you start the DataMiner Cube desktop application, the latest Cube binary files are downloaded to your client PC (`%localappdata%\Skyline\DataMiner\DataMinerCube\`) and executed.

Several command line arguments can be specified when starting the application. For a list, see below. In normal circumstances, none of these are required. They will be added automatically where applicable. However, in a number of special cases, it might be necessary to use them, either once or permanently (e.g. in a shortcut).

> [!NOTE]
> All arguments and options are case-insensitive.

## Overview

### /Alias=Xyz

Displays a custom alias ("Xyz") instead of the cluster name in the Cube header. Must be combined with the `/Host=hostname` argument. The alias will be used as long as the client is connected with the specified host.

### /Autorun

Starts the DataMiner Cube desktop application in the system tray. The application will only close when you close it explicitly via the context menu of the system tray icon.

### /Bootstrap

Combines the `/Install` and `/Silent` arguments and also copies a number of files, such as *DataMinerCube.exe.config* en *CubeLauncherConfig.json*.

Available from DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.9 onwards.

### /Display

Opens the DataMiner Cube start window.

### /Hostname=xyz

Adds the DataMiner System with hostname "xyz" to the list of DataMiner Systems (if it has not been added yet).

### /Install

Checks if DataMiner Cube is installed. If not, the installation wizard is opened.

### /Install /Silent

Checks if DataMiner Cube is installed. If not, it is installed with the default options. Exits afterwards.

### /InstallOptions

Can be combined with `/Install` or `/Install /Silent` to modify the installation options.

Supported options:

- *DesktopShortcut*
- *NoDesktopShortcut*
- *StartMenuShortcut*
- *NoStartMenuShortcut*
- *StartOnLogin* (Starts DataMiner Cube in the system tray after login.)
- *NoStartOnLogin*
- *OpenAfterInstall* (Opens the start window after installation.)
- *NoOpenAfterInstall* (Default for silent installs.)

For example, the following command can be used to silently check the DataMiner Cube installation and start the installation if necessary (for example, in a logon script to automatically install DataMiner Cube from a network share for all users).

```txt
PathToCubeExe.exe /Install /Silent /InstallOptions:StartOnLogin
```

### /Launch

Opens DataMiner Cube and immediately connects to the DataMiner System specified in the `/Hostname` argument.

If no hostname argument was used, DataMiner Cube will connect to the DataMiner System that was last added to the list of DataMiner Systems.

### /Modify

Opens a window that allows you to modify the installation.

### /Modify /Silent

Allows the installation to be modified without any user interaction. Must be combined with `/ModifyOptions` to specify the modifications.

### /ModifyOptions

Can be combined with `/Modify` to preselect modifications in the modify UI, or with `/Modify /Silent` to specify the desired modifications.

Supported options:

- *ClearProtocolCache*
- *ClearVisioCache*
- *ClearVersionCache* (Removes all cached versions.)
- *RemoveVersion:versionnumber* (Removes a specific cached version. Can be used multiple times)

To combine multiple options, use a comma as separator.

For example, this is a silent command to modify the DataMiner Cube installation (clearing the protocol cache, clearing the Visio cache and removing two cached versions):

```txt
PathToCubeExe.exe /Modify /Silent /ModifyOptions:ClearProtocolCache,ClearVisioCache,RemoveVersion:9.5.1638.4080,RemoveVersion:10.0.2042.1636
```

### /NoInstall

Runs the DataMiner Cube desktop application without checking whether anything needs to be installed or upgraded.

### /NoSelfUpdate

Runs the currently installed version of the DataMiner Cube desktop application. If a newer version exists, no automatic upgrade will be performed.

### /Position=x,y

Opens the DataMiner Cube desktop application at position "x,y" of the current working area.

### /UnInstall

Uninstalls the DataMiner Cube desktop application.

### /UnInstall /Silent

Uninstalls the DataMiner Cube desktop application in silent mode (without UI).

### /Update

Combines `/UpdateClients` and `/UpdateLauncher`.

### /UpdateClients

Updates the Cube versions of all the DataMiner Systems to which you have connected in the last 100 days.

### /UpdateLauncher

Checks for newer versions of the DataMiner Cube desktop application on the 10 DataMiner Systems to which you connected last. If a newer version is found, the application will be automatically upgraded.

> [!NOTE]
> If there is internet access, <https://dataminer.services> will be checked as well.
