# Monitoring app card pane

The card pane of the Monitoring app is the large pane on the right side of the app. If no cards are opened, this pane displays the app home page, which shows a list of recent items. If a card is opened, the displayed content depends on the type of card.

## Types of cards

The following card types are available:

- [View cards](xref:View_Cards)

- [Service cards](xref:Service_Cards)

- [Element cards](xref:Element_Cards)

- [Alarm cards](xref:Alarm_Cards)

- [CPE cards](xref:CPE_Cards)

- [Spectrum analyzer cards](xref:Spectrum_Analyzer_Cards)

> - If the app is used on a mobile device, to make optimal use of the available space on the screen, the app layout may be different from what is described in this section.
> - If the app is viewed in a browser that supports full-screen mode, for parameter tables, data pages, CPE/EPM pages and visual pages, a full-screen button is available: ![Full-screen button](~/dataminer/images/CubeMaximize00028.png)
>
>   Click this button to view the item in full-screen mode. To leave full-screen mode using a keyboard, press Esc or F11, depending on the browser.

## Zooming and panning

From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.3 onwards<!--RN 38395-->, zooming and panning functionalities are available for visual overview pages. These pages feature Visio-based visual overviews and are available for view cards, service cards, and element cards.

- To zoom in, scroll up.

- To zoom out, scroll down.

- To move left or right across a visual overview, click the card and drag your mouse.

If the app is used on a mobile device:

- To zoom in, place two fingers close together on the screen and move them apart.

- To zoom out, place two fingers stretched apart on the screen and bring them together.

- To move left or right across a visual overview, slide a finger across the screen.

## Visual Overview

Visual overview pages in the DataMiner web apps are a lightweight version of their DataMiner Cube counterparts. This means that some features that are available in Cube will not be available in the web apps. For more details, see [Unsupported capabilities](xref:DashboardVisualOverview#unsupported-capabilities).
