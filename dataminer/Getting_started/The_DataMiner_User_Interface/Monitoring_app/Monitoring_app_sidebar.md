# Monitoring app sidebar

> [!NOTE]
> If the app is used on a mobile device, to make optimal use of the available space on the screen, the app layout may be different from what is described in this section.

The sidebar on the left side of the Monitoring app UI contains two icons, which can be used to expand different panes:

- ![Navigation pane](~/dataminer/images/GettingStarted00026.jpg) : Opens the navigation pane, which allows you to navigate through the different views in DataMiner and open the objects they contain. The arrow icon in front of a view allows you to open it and view the underlying objects. Selecting an object in the navigation pane opens the corresponding card in the pane on the right.

- ![Recent](~/dataminer/images/MonitoringX_recent.png) : Displays a list of recent items. Select an item to open the corresponding card in the pane on the right.
