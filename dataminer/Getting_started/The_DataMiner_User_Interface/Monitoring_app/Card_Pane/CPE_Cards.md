# CPE cards

On the left side of a CPE card, a collapsible card navigation pane provides access to the pages of the card. You can resize this pane by dragging its right edge.

The following pages are available:

- The pages that are available for element cards: see [Element cards](xref:Element_Cards).

- *Topology*: One or more pages with the different chains in the topology. When you open such a page, filter boxes on the right side of the card can be used to drill down to specific items.

CPE cards can be opened from the navigation or recent items pane, or from the search. In addition, you can also navigate directly to a CPE element using the following URL: <br>*http(s)://*\<DMA IP>*/monitoring/element/*\<DMA ID>*/*\<element ID>*/chain/*\<chain name>
