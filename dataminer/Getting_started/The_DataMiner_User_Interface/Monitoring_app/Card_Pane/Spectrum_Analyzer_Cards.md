# Spectrum analyzer cards

A spectrum analyzer card is similar to an [element card](xref:Element_Cards), but has a special "Spectrum Analyzer" page. If you open this spectrum page, a spectrum trace using a new monitor with the most recent preset will be displayed.

The Spectrum Analyzer page contains buttons to the following tabs:

| Button | Tab description |
|--|--|
| ![Info button](~/dataminer/images/MonitoringX_spectruminfo.png) | Information tab. Contains basic information about the current measurement points, markers, thresholds and parameters. If no markers or thresholds are available for the current preset, these sections are not displayed in the tab. |
| ![Traces button](~/dataminer/images/MonitoringX_spectrumtraces.png) | Traces tab. Allows you to select whether the current, minimum, maximum and/or average trace should be displayed. However, if a measurement point is selected, only the current trace can be shown. |
| ![Presets button](~/dataminer/images/MonitoringX_spectrumpresets.png) | Presets tab. This tab shows a list of all available presets. By default, only private presets are shown, i.e. presets that are only available to the current user. To view all presets, select Show shared presets. Select a preset and click Load to display it on the spectrum page. |
