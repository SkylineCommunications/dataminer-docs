# Ordering DataMiner credits

To create and maintain a DaaS instance, your [organization](xref:Pricing_Usage_based_service#organization) must have sufficient DataMiner credits. To order DataMiner credits for the first time, follow the procedure below.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have already created a SaaS subscription as detailed below, and you want to order **additional credits**, you do not have to create a new SaaS subscription. Instead, go to your SaaS subscription in the Azure portal, and click *Open SaaS Account on publisher's site* to be redirected to the *Purchase credits* page.

1. Go to the Microsoft Marketplace [DataMiner page](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/product/saas/skylinecommunicationsnv1644148291022.dataminer?tab=PlansAndPrice).

1. Click *Get It Now* for the DataMiner credit plan.

   1. Provide a resource name for the SaaS subscription resource.

   1. Assign the resource to a resource group.
