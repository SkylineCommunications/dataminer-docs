# Ordering DataMiner credits

To create and maintain a DaaS instance, your [organization](xref:Pricing_Usage_based_service#organization) must have sufficient DataMiner credits. To order DataMiner credits for the first time, follow the procedure below.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have already created a SaaS subscription as detailed below, and you want to order **additional credits**, you do not have to create a new SaaS subscription. Instead, go to your SaaS subscription in the Azure portal, and click *Open SaaS Account on publisher's site* to be redirected to the *Purchase credits* page.

1. Go to the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) and search for DataMiner.

1. Click *Get It Now*.
