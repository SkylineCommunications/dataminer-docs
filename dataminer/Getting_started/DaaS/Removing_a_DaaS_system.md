# Removing a DaaS system

> [!WARNING]
> When you remove a DaaS system, the system will be decommissioned. Within 7 days after you remove the system, you can still recover it by contacting [daas@dataminer.services](mailto:daas@dataminer.services). After that period, the cloud identity, shares, and all [Storage as a Service (STaaS)](xref:STaaS) data will be lost.

1. Make sure you are logged in to dataminer.services with an account that has either the **Admin or Owner** role on organization level, or the **Owner** role on system level.

1. On the dataminer.services page, click the ellipsis ("...") button in the top-right corner of the box representing the system and select *Delete DMS*.

1. Fill in the name of the system to confirm that this is the system you want to remove.

1. Click *Delete*.

> [!NOTE]
> If you select *Delete DMS* for a **self-managed DataMiner System** instead of a DaaS system, this will disconnect the system from dataminer.services. See [Permanently disconnecting from dataminer.services](xref:Disconnecting_from_dataminer.services#permanently-disconnecting-from-dataminerservices). If your self-managed DataMiner System is a Community Edition system or runs in subscription mode, your system will then stop working after 1 month, unless you convert it to a perpetual license or offline demo license. See also [Switching from subscription mode to perpetual license](xref:Switching_from_subscription_mode_to_perpetual_license) and [Switching from subscription mode to an offline demo license](xref:Switching_from_subscription_mode_to_offline_demo).
