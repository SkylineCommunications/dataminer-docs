# Editing a dashboard

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This information is applicable to the DMS Dashboards module, which is being retired as of DataMiner version 10.4.x. See [DataMiner functionality evolution and retirement](xref:Software_support_life_cycles#dataminer-functionality-evolution-and-retirement). We recommend using the [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D) instead.

To edit a dashboard:

- In the list of dashboards, click the pencil icon to the left of the dashboard name.

  You will have the same options as during dashboard creation.

  For more information, see [Creating a new dashboard](xref:Creating_a_new_dashboard).
