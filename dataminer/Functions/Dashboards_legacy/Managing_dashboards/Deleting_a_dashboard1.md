# Deleting a dashboard

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This information is applicable to the DMS Dashboards module, which is being retired as of DataMiner version 10.4.x. See [DataMiner functionality evolution and retirement](xref:Software_support_life_cycles#dataminer-functionality-evolution-and-retirement). We recommend using the [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D) instead.

To delete a dashboard:

- In the list of dashboards, click the pencil icon to the left of the dashboard name.

- Click the red x icon that has appeared to the right of the dashboard name.

- In the confirmation box, click *OK* to confirm the deletion.
