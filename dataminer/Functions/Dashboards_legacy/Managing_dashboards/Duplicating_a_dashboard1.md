# Duplicating a dashboard

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This information is applicable to the DMS Dashboards module, which is being retired as of DataMiner version 10.4.x. See [DataMiner functionality evolution and retirement](xref:Software_support_life_cycles#dataminer-functionality-evolution-and-retirement). We recommend using the [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D) instead.

To duplicate a dashboard:

- In the list of dashboards, click the pencil icon to the left of the dashboard name.

- Click the Duplicate dashboard icon that has appeared to the right of the dashboard name.

  Follow the same steps as during dashboard creation to finish the duplicated dashboard.

  For more information, see [Creating a new dashboard](xref:Creating_a_new_dashboard).
