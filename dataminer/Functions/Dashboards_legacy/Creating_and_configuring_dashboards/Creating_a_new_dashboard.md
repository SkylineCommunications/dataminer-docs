# Creating a new dashboard

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This information is applicable to the DMS Dashboards module, which is being retired as of DataMiner version 10.4.x. See [DataMiner functionality evolution and retirement](xref:Software_support_life_cycles#dataminer-functionality-evolution-and-retirement). We recommend using the [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D) instead.

To create a new dashboard in the *Dashboards* app:

1. Click the *New Dashboard* button. A new dashboard will be added to the list.

1. Next to *Title*, fill in a title for the dashboard.

1. The following configuration options are also available:

    - Click the *...* button next to *Theme* to change the theme for the dashboard. This theme can be overruled by a personal theme.

    - Next to *Description*, you can add a description with additional information about the dashboard.

    - You can select a folder for the dashboard in the drop-down list on the right. To create a new folder, select *\<Create New>*.

    - Click the *...* button next to *Layout* to change the layout of the dashboard. Dashboard components can be displayed in one to five columns, as an embedded component, in a raster, or in a dynamic list. For more information on the dynamic list layout, see [Creating a dashboard with a dynamic list layout](xref:Creating_a_dashboard_with_a_dynamic_list_layout).

        > [!NOTE]
        > Be careful when changing the layout of an existing dashboard. Components could be deleted as a result of your changes.

1. At this point, there are two possibilities to save the dashboard:

    - If you want to configure the components of the dashboard later, click *Save Configuration*. To edit the dashboard later, click the pencil icon in the dashboard list.

    - If you want to configure the dashboard immediately, click *Save & Start Configuring Components*. See [Configuring dashboard components](xref:Configuring_dashboard_components1#configuring-dashboard-components).
