# Creating a dashboard container

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This information is applicable to the DMS Dashboards module, which is being retired as of DataMiner version 10.4.x. See [DataMiner functionality evolution and retirement](xref:Software_support_life_cycles#dataminer-functionality-evolution-and-retirement). We recommend using the [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D) instead.

It is possible to combine several dashboards in one dashboard container. When you open the dashboard container, the different dashboards will be available as tab pages, so that you can easily navigate between them.

To create a new dashboard container in the *Dashboards* app:

1. Click the *New dashboard container* button. A new dashboard container will be added to the list.

1. Next to *Title*, fill in a title for the dashboard container.

1. The following configuration options are also available:

    - Click the *...* button next to *Theme* to change the theme for the dashboard container. This theme can be overruled by a personal theme.

    - Next to *Description*, you can add a description with additional information about the dashboard container.

    - You can select a folder for the dashboard container in the drop-down list on the right. To create a new folder, select *\<Create New>*.

1. Under *Included dashboards*, for each dashboard you want to include in the container, select the dashboard in the drop-down list and click *Add*.

1. Click *Save Configuration* to save the dashboard container.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to edit the dashboard container later, this is only possible in the list of dashboards, by clicking the pencil icon next to the dashboard container. If you click directly on the dashboard container in the overview on the left side of the *Dashboards* app, you will be able to edit the different dashboards in the dashboard container, but not the dashboard container itself.
