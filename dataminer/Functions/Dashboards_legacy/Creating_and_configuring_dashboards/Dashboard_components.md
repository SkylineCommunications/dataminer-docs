# Dashboard components

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This information is applicable to the DMS Dashboards module, which is being retired as of DataMiner version 10.4.x. See [DataMiner functionality evolution and retirement](xref:Software_support_life_cycles#dataminer-functionality-evolution-and-retirement). We recommend using the [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D) instead.

The available dashboard components are divided in seven groups, according to what they represent.

## Aggregation components

This group consists of the following components:

- [Aggregation](#aggregation)
- [Aggregation bar graph](#aggregation-bar-graph)
- [Aggregation pie graph](#aggregation-pie-graph)
- [Aggregation trend graph](#aggregation-trend-graph)
- [Aggregation graph filters](#aggregation-graph-filters)

> [!NOTE]
> The Aggregation components can only be used when the DMA is licensed for Correlation.

> [!TIP]
> See also: [Working with aggregation rules](xref:Working_with_aggregation_rules)

### Aggregation

Overview of data for one or more aggregation rules in one or more views.

### Aggregation trend graph

Trend graph representing one or more aggregation rules in one or more views. The feed for this component consists of one or more groups of aggregation rules. The groups can be given a custom range. Optionally, a filter can be specified for any of the rules. For more information on these filters, see [Aggregation graph filters](#aggregation-graph-filters).

Component-specific options for each added aggregation rule:

- *Graph style*: Select one of the available styles in the drop-down list to change what kind of graph line is used.

- *Graph color*: Click the ellipsis button to choose a different color for the graph.

- *Graph width*: Enter a different value to adjust the graph width.

- *Legend separate lines*: Select this option to put new lines between the labels in the legend.

- *Legend always visible*: If this option is enabled, the legend will remain displayed even when the mouse pointer does not hover over the graph. In that case, the legend just presents the parameter name without a value. This can be useful to allow the user to scroll to a particular parameter in the legend, in order to then view the value for this parameter when hovering the mouse pointer over the graph.

- *Show legend upon mouseover*: In the drop-down list, select where the legend should be displayed when the mouse pointer passes over the graph: as an overlay over the graph, next to the graph, or below the graph.

- *Average history duration*: Enter a unit for the number of trend ranges to take in account for the calculation of the average history trend. The average history trend line will then be displayed as a dotted line on the graph. If "0" is entered, this option is disabled.

- *Overlay legend width*, *Minimum visible gap size, Y-axis label width*, *Axis label font size*, etc.: Adjust these settings to fine-tune the layout of the trend graph.

- *Background color*: Click the ellipsis button to choose a different background color for the graph.

### Aggregation graph filters

In all aggregation graph components, filters can be specified, similar to the filters that can be used throughout DataMiner Cube to get data from a table.

These filters can be specified in two ways:

- You can enter any value, for example "myvalue". DataMiner will automatically translate this to a filter of the type "value=PK == myvalue\*".

- You can specify a column filter directly, for example "value=4010 == myvalue\*", where 4010 is the column parameter ID of the table.

  For aggregation, the following column value IDs can be used:

  - *4010* = property value (when grouping by property)

  - *4009* = protocol value (when grouping by protocol)

  - *4005* = value

  - *4004* = remote pk

  - *4003* = view ID

  - *4002* = rule ID

  - *4001* = PK (= ruleID.viewID\[.protocol\]\[.property\].remote pk - with \[\] being optional depending on the rule configuration.)

## Alarms components

This group consists of the following components:

- [Alarm count element](#alarm-count-element-alarms)
- [Alarm count service](#alarm-count-service-alarms)

### Alarm count service (alarms)

Pie chart showing the number of alarms for a service during the last 24 hours. This component has the same component-specific options as the *Alarm count element* component described above.

### Alarm list (alarms)

Overview of active alarms or alarms in a recent fixed or sliding window.

Component-specific options:

- *Mode*: Select the mode for the alarm list in the drop-down list. You can choose to display active alarms, or history alarms in different time ranges.

- *Highlight time*: Enter the number of seconds you want new alarms to be highlighted.

- *History tracking*: Select this option to show only the most recent alarm of an alarm’s lifecycle. To show the alarm history as separate alarm records in the list instead, clear the selection.

- *Group by element*: Select this option to group the alarms by element.

- *Group by service*: Select this option to group the alarms by service.

- *Minimal alarm level*: In the drop-down list, select the minimum alarm level of alarms displayed in the list.

- *Advanced filter*: In this box, you can enter an alarm filter to limit what alarms are shown in the list. For more information on alarm filters, see [Alarm filters](xref:Alarm_filters).

  For example, for an alarm filter called "Major", which is a shared filter, enter the following:

  ```xml
  <Major (shared filter)>
  ```

  It is also possible to combine multiple filters using "or". For example

  ```xml
  <Major (shared filter)> or <open alarms (shared filter)>
  ```

- *Feed filter*: In this box, enter a parameter, element, service, view or protocol feed to limit the alarms shown in the list.

  The filter feed can also be used when the alarm list is part of a dynamic list type dashboard. In that case, the feed filter will be combined with the selection for the current row. This allows e.g. a dynamic list dashboard to iterate over elements and to show an element-limited dashboard for each of the elements.

  > [!TIP]
  > See also: [Creating a dashboard with a dynamic list layout](xref:Creating_a_dashboard_with_a_dynamic_list_layout)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If a table column parameter is included, and the dashboard also contains a *Generic real-time parameter* component that is configured with a table parameter, then it is possible to link the parameter index of the *Inline frame* component with that component. In that case, when a user clicks a row of that table, the *Inline frame* component will update the URL with the parameter value of the clicked row. For more information, see [Generic real-time parameter](#generic-real-time-parameter-parameter).
> - Webpages displayed in an *Inline frame* component automatically have an authentication ticket attached as a URL parameter, so that it is not necessary to log in again on web apps that run on the same DMA as the Dashboards app, such as the Monitoring app.

Component-specific options:

- *URL*: In the box, fill in the URL of the website that should be displayed in the frame.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The URL can contain the placeholder *%elementname%*. When the component is rendered, this placeholder will be resolved with the URL-encoded element name specified in the parameter feed, if any.

- *Custom height*: In the box, fill in the height of the component in pixels

Optionally, a feed can be used with this component. This can for instance be of use to dynamically include the value of a parameter in the image URL. To do so, select a parameter feed, and include *%parametervalue%* in the URL. This will then be replaced with the value of that parameter.

> [!NOTE]
> If a table column parameter is included, and the dashboard also contains a *Generic real-time parameter* component that is configured with a table parameter, then it is possible to link the parameter index of the *Video* component with that component. In that case, when a user clicks a row of that table, the video component will update the URL with the parameter value of the clicked row, which makes it possible to show thumbnails of another video source. For more information, see [Generic real-time parameter](#generic-real-time-parameter-parameter).

Component-specific options:

- *Image URL*: In the box, fill in the URL of the video stream.

- *Frames per second*: In the box, specify how many times the image should update per second. By default, this is set to *20*.
