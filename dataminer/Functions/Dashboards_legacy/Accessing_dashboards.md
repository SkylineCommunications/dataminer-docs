# Accessing dashboards

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This information is applicable to the DMS Dashboards module, which is being retired as of DataMiner version 10.4.x. See [DataMiner functionality evolution and retirement](xref:Software_support_life_cycles#dataminer-functionality-evolution-and-retirement). We recommend using the [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D) instead.

To access DataMiner dashboards:

- In DataMiner Cube, go to *Apps* > *Reports & Dashboards*, or

- Go directly to the link `https://[MyDataMiner]/Dashboards` or `http://[MyDataMiner]/Dashboards`, depending on your setup.

More information on accessing the Dashboards app is included in the following topics:

- [Logging on to the Dashboards App](xref:Logging_on_to_the_Dashboards_App)

- [Dashboard URL options](xref:Dashboard_URL_options)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Some dashboard components, such as the *Trend parameter* component, can be used outside the *Dashboards* app in custom portals. The code and web services for the components can be found on the DMA in the folder `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Webpages\Dashboards\Parts`.
> - While data is being loaded in a dashboard, an activity indicator is displayed in the top-right corner of the page. You can click the indicator to see the number of calls in progress.
