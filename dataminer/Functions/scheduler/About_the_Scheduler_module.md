# About the Scheduler module

DataMiner Scheduler allows you to manage a list of scheduled tasks that are to be executed by DataMiner.

![Scheduler](~/dataminer/images/Scheduler.png)<br>*DataMiner Scheduler in DataMiner 10.4.5*

You can access DataMiner Scheduler in DataMiner Cube, via *Apps* > *Scheduler*.

In the app, you can [add scheduled tasks in the *list* tab](xref:Manually_adding_a_scheduled_task), and get an overview of everything that has been scheduled in the *timeline* > *tasks* tab.

The *timeline* > *events* tab provides a different way to [create scheduled events](xref:Scheduling_an_event_based_on_a_Scheduler_template), based on a special type of Automation scripts called "Scheduler templates".
