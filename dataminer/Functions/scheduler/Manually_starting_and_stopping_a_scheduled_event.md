# Manually starting and stopping a scheduled event

Even if an event has been scheduled to be executed at a different time, whether this is in the past or in the future, it is possible to manually start and stop the event at any moment.

To do so:

1. In the *Scheduler* module, go to the *timeline \> EVENTS* tab.

1. Right-click the colored rectangle indicating the task on the timeline. In the right-click menu:

   - To immediately start a task, select *Manual start*.

   - To immediately stop a task that is being executed, select *Manual stop*.

> [!NOTE]
> If you manually execute a scheduled start or stop task at a particular time, the task will be executed again at the time when it was originally scheduled.
