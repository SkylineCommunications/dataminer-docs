# Working with the RAD Manager

The RAD Manager is a low-code app, available in the Catalog, that allows you to easily configure [relational anomaly detection](xref:Relational_anomaly_detection) and visualize the calculated anomaly scores and the detected anomalies. The app requires DataMiner 10.5.4/10.6.0 or higher.

  > [!NOTE]
> - This page describes the RAD Manager app as of version 4.0.0. Earlier versions did not support [shared model groups](xref:Relational_anomaly_detection#shared-model-groups) and used a different layout. For details on those versions, see [Working with the RAD Manager (versions before 4.0.0)](xref:RAD_manager_old_layout).
> - The RAD Manager app with version 4.0.0 or higher require DataMiner 10.6.1(FR)/10.6.0(MR) or higher.

## Installing the RAD Manager

To install the RAD Manager app, go to [RAD Manager](https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/174b9848-43c8-470d-afc2-1b1722f05e74) in the Catalog and deploy the app to your DataMiner System by clicking the *Deploy* button.

You can then find the RAD Manager app on your DataMiner landing page at `https://[Your DMA]/root`.

> [!TIP]
> See also [Accessing the web apps](xref:Accessing_the_web_apps).

## Inspecting the configured relational anomaly groups

The **RAD Manager** main window provides an overview of all relational anomaly groups currently monitored by RAD. For each group, you can view:

- Configuration settings  
- The parameters included in the group  
- Trend graphs for each parameter  
- Historical anomalies detected for the group  
- Anomaly scores generated by the current model version on historical trend data  

![The main window of the RAD Manager app](~/dataminer/images/RAD_Manager_NewLayout.png)

### Relational Anomaly Groups

The **Relational Anomaly Groups** table in the left pane lists all RAD parameter groups that have been configured in the system.  

When you start the app for the first time, this table will typically be empty. To create a new group, use the header bar options:

- [*Add Single Group*](#adding-a-single-group)
- [*Add Shared Model Group*](#adding-a-shared-model-group)

For each group, the following configuration options are displayed (see also [*Options for relational anomaly groups*](xref:Relational_anomaly_detection#options-for-relational-anomaly-groups)):

- ![AnomalyTresholdIcon](~/dataminer/images/AnomalyThresholdIcon.png) Anomaly Threshold: The score threshold used for generating anomalies. When the anomaly score exceeds this threshold, RAD flags the behavior and triggers a suggestion event.
- ![MinimumAnomalyDuratonIcon](~/dataminer/images/MinimumAnomalyDurationIcon.png) Minimum Anomaly Duration: The minimum amount of time that abnormal behavior must persist before being considered a significant anomaly.  This works similarly to alarm hysteresis. If this value is greater than 5 minutes, the anomaly must persist longer before a suggestion event is triggered.
- ![ModelTypeIcon](~/dataminer/images/ModelTypeIcon.png) Model Type 
   -  Adaptive Model – RAD continuously updates its internal model as new trend data becomes available. Because the model adapts, it can reduce false positives in systems where “normal” is not constant.  
   -  Static Model – The model is trained once at creation, or again only if you manually define a new training period. It is ideal for consistent, predictable metrics where the baseline doesn’t drift. A static model provides repeatability and control, since it won’t update unless you explicitly retrain it.

To modify group configuration settings, click the **Edit** pencil icon ![EditIcon](~/dataminer/images/EditIcon.png).

![Group](~/dataminer/images/RAD_group.png)

A group with an active relational anomaly suggestion event is marked with the red anomaly icon ![RADAnomalyRedIcon](~/dataminer/images/RADAnomalyRedIcon.png). A group that can no longer be monitored—for example, because the element or a configured parameter no longer exists—is marked with the yellow exclamation icon ![RADExclamationIcon](~/dataminer/images/RADExclamationIcon.png).

Each group is labeled as either a [*Single Group*](#adding-a-single-group), meaning it has its own model, or a [*Shared Model Group*](#adding-a-shared-model-group), where multiple subgroups use the same underlying model. 

When you select a shared model group, a side panel appears showing all of its subgroups. Within the [RAD Manager app](xref:RAD_manager), shared model subgroups flagged by the [Fleet Outlier Detection](xref:Relational_anomaly_detection#identifying-anomalous-subgroups-in-a-shared-model-group) are explicitly labeled as *Outlier Group*. You can easily review these outlier groups by sorting the subgroup view. The outliers are ranked based on a score that quantifies the degree of difference from the rest of the group, with the most statistically anomalous subgroups appearing at the top of the list. 

<img src="~/dataminer/images/RAD_Outlier_Group.png" alt="Outlier Group" width="50%">

Use the *Sorting & filtering* button to apply some filtering on the groups being shown in the *Relational Anomaly Groups* table or to apply a different sorting.

### Viewing Trends and Anomaly Scores

Selecting a group in the **Relational Anomaly Groups** table displays the trend graphs for all parameters in that group. You can adjust the displayed time range as needed.

The **Anomaly score of selected group** graph visualizes how strongly the group’s behavior deviates from the relationships learned by the RAD model. Higher scores indicate more anomalous behavior, while low scores reflect normal, expected behavior.

If RAD detects a score in new data that exceeds the group’s **Anomaly Threshold**, it flags an anomaly and generates a suggestion event.  
You can find these events under **Suggestion events** in the Alarm Console (see [*Relational anomalies in the Alarm Console*](xref:Relational_anomaly_detection#relational-anomalies-in-the-alarm-console)) in Cube. If an anomaly event occurs within the selected time range, it is also shown in the timeline component beneath the graphs in the RAD Manager.

For Shared Model Groups, you must first select one of the subgroups. The displayed graphs will then show:

- The trend data for the selected subgroup
- The historical anomaly score and anomaly events for that subgroup


## Adding a relational anomaly group

To add a new relational anomaly parameter group, select *Add Single Group* or *Add Shared Model Group* in the top-left corner of the app. This will open a window where you can configure the group you want to add.

> [!TIP]
> The RAD Manager offers an intuitive interface for creating, configuring, and inspecting relational anomaly groups. However, if you need to create a large number of groups or perform repeated or automated updates, consider using the [RAD API](xref:RAD_API) for more control.

### Adding a single group

A single group uses its own dedicated relational anomaly model trained solely on that group’s parameters. Use a single group when you want the highest accuracy for a specific set of parameters, without comparing it to others, and when there is sufficient healthy data available for that group.

![Adding a single group](~/dataminer/images/RAD_Manager_AddSingleParameterGroup_NewLayout.png)

If you have selected to add a single group, you can configure it as follows:

1. Specify the name of the group.

   The group name will be used when listing the configured groups in the main window and in suggestion events generated when an anomaly is detected.

1. Add at least two parameter instances:

   1. Select the correct element in the *Element* dropdown.

   1. Select the parameter.

   1. If you have selected a table parameter, specify the display key of the parameter instance under *Display key filter*. If your table parameter has no display key, specify the primary key instead.

   1. Click the *Add* button.

   1. Repeat the previous steps until you have added all the parameter instances you want.

      You can specify multiple instances for the same parameter by using wildcard characters \* and ? under *Display key filter*. (See [Searching with wildcard characters](xref:Searching_in_DataMiner_Cube#searching-with-wildcard-characters).)

   > [!NOTE]
   > Only parameters that meet the [limitations and prerequisites for RAD](xref:Relational_anomaly_detection) are shown in the *Add Single Group* window.

1. Optionally, select different [options for the relational anomaly group](xref:Relational_anomaly_detection#options-for-relational-anomaly-groups).

1. When you have fully configured the group, click *Add group*.


### Adding a shared model group

A [shared model group](xref:Relational_anomaly_detection#shared-model-groups) allows multiple relational anomaly subgroups to utilize a common detection model, leveraging their combined data for training. This is ideal when monitoring many similar entities or when some subgroups suffer from insufficient healthy training data. Use a shared model group when consistency and scalability are prioritized over the specialized, subgroup-specific accuracy of isolated models.

![Adding a shared model group](~/dataminer/images/RAD_Manager_AddSharedParameterGroup.png)

If you have selected to add a shared model group, you can configure it as follows:

1. Specify the name of the shared model group.

1. Specify the number of parameters per subgroup, and optionally use *Edit Labels* to assign a descriptive label to each.
For example, a shared model group can be used to monitor a fleet of AC units across a large building complex. Since all units operate under similar principles, they can share a common anomaly detection model, which helps to mitigate the sparse healthy training data that might exist for any single unit. if monitoring multiple AC units (subgroups) that relate Temperature to Power, you would define the labels *Supply_Air_Temperature* and *Compressor_Power* in the Shared Model Group.
These consistent, descriptive labels will then appear in RAD suggestion events and the RAD Manager app, ensuring uniform interpretation across the entire fleet of units.

1. Add at least two subgroups of parameters:

   1. Click the *Add subgroup* button.

   1. Optionally specify a group name for the subgroup. If no subgroup name is provided, the name of the shared model group will be used when creating suggestion events.

   1. Select the parameters. If you select a table parameter, specify the display key of the parameter instance under *Display key filter*.

      > [!NOTE]
      > - Only parameters that meet the [limitations and prerequisites for RAD](xref:Relational_anomaly_detection) are shown in the *Add Shared Model Group* window.  
      > - Ensure that the parameter order is consistent across all subgroups. For example, if *Supply_Air_Temperature* is selected as the first parameter and *Compressor_Power* as the second in the first subgroup, then *Supply_Air_Temperature* must also be the first parameter in every other subgroup.

   1. Optionally select different [options for the relational anomaly group](xref:Relational_anomaly_detection#options-for-relational-anomaly-groups) for the subgroup. If no options are selected, the subgroup will be monitored using the options defined for the shared model group.

   1. Click *OK* to add the subgroup.

1. Optionally, select different [options for the relational anomaly group](xref:Relational_anomaly_detection#options-for-relational-anomaly-groups) for the shared model group.

1. When the configuration is complete, click *Add group*.

## Editing a relational anomaly parameter group

To edit an existing group, select it in the table under *Relational Anomaly Groups* and click the Edit button.

This will open a window where you can change the group name, add or remove parameters, and modify group options. For more details, refer to [Adding a single group](#adding-a-single-group) and [Adding a shared model group](#adding-a-shared-model-group).

## Configure model training

The Edit window also gives you the option to retrain the relational anomaly model and to open a *Configure model training* window.
Retraining RAD’s internal model can be beneficial in certain cases. It enables you to define time periods during which the relational anomaly group was behaving normally, helping RAD more accurately detect future deviations. By default, RAD trains each group upon creation using all available five-minute average trend data (up to a maximum of two months). If this initial training period included anomalous data, contained limited data, or if parameter behavior has changed over time, retraining with a specified time range can improve model accuracy.

![Configure model training](~/dataminer/images/RAD_Manager_ConfigureTraining.png)

 In the *Configure model training* window you can specify one or more time ranges that will be used to retrain the selected relational anomaly group.

1. To add a time range, select the desired start and end time in the pickers near *From* and *to*, and then click *Add*.

1. Repeat the process to add additional time ranges.

1. Once you have added the desired time ranges, click *Apply*.

   This will immediately retrain the relational anomaly group, and you will see the resulting anomaly scores in the main window.

## Removing a relational anomaly parameter group

To delete one or more groups, select them in the table under *Relational Anomaly Groups* and click the *Remove Group* button.

When a group is removed, it will no longer be monitored by RAD. From DataMiner 10.5.6/10.6.0 onwards<!--RN 42602-->, all active suggestion events linked to the group will automatically be cleared.

## View historical anomalies

The *Historical Anomalies* button in the upper right corner of the RAD Manager app opens a side panel listing all historical anomaly detections for the selected relational anomaly group. Clicking the *Show* button highlights the anomaly occurrence in the trend graphs of the main window.

You can also open the *Historical Anomalies* side panel by clicking the *Show anomalies in last 30 days* button displayed on each relational anomaly group tile in the *Relational Anomaly Groups* table. This ![HistoricalAnomaliesIcon](~/dataminer/images/RAD_Manager_HistoricalAnomalies.png) button also provides a quick visual indication of the number of anomalies detected in the past 30 days.
