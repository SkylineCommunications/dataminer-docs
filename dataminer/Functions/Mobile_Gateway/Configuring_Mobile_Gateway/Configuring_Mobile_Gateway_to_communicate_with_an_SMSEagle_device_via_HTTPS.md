# Configuring Mobile Gateway to communicate with an SMSEagle device via HTTPS

It is possible to set up communication with an SMSEagle device via HTTPS. To do so:

1. Open `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Mobile Gateway\Config.xml`.

1. In the `<HttpGsm>` tag, add the following subtags:

   - **UseHttps**: Set to "true" to enable HTTPS.
   - **RequireValidSsl**: Set to "true" to require a valid certificate on the SMSEagle device (recommended). In that case, the *HttpGSM.Location* tag must contain "smseagle" instead of the IP address of the device.

1. Make sure the port attribute of the `<Location>` tag is set to the port on which the SMSEagle device is listening. This will most likely be port 443.

   Example of the `<HttpGsm>` configuration in *Config.xml*:

   ```xml
   <HttpGsm>
     <Location port="443">smseagle</Location>
     <Schedule>3</Schedule>
     <UseHttps>true</UseHttps>
     <RequireValidSsl>true</RequireValidSsl>
     <SMSEagle user="user" pass="pass"/>
   </HttpGsm>
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > From DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.5 onwards, you can also add the *unicode="true"* attribute to the *SMSEagle* element to make the SMSEagle device use Unicode characters when sending text messages.

If `<RequireValidSsl>` is set to *false*, no further configuration is required. If this is set to *true*, follow the procedure below:

1. Make sure the DataMiner Agent trusts the default server certificate of the SMSEagle device:

   1. In your internet browser, go to `https://\<IP address of the SMSEagle device`>.

      If an error message appears, telling you that the site is not secure, ignore it.

   1. Click the warning triangle to the left of the URL bar, and click *certificate*. A window will open.

   1. Go to the *Details* tab, and click *Copy to File.*

   1. Click *Next*, specify a random folder and a file name, and click *Save*.

   1. Open the Microsoft Management Console. To do so, press WINDOWS+R, type "mmc", and press Enter.

   1. In the Microsoft Management Console, press Ctrl+M.

   1. In the *Add or Remove Snap-ins* window, select "Certificate" from the *Available snap-ins* list, and click *Add*.

   1. Select the following options:

      - *Computer Account*

      - *Local Computer*

   1. Click *OK* to close the *Add or Remove Snap-ins* window.

   1. Under the *Console Root*, go to *Certificates (Local Computer) \> Trusted Root Certification Authorities \> Certificates*.

   1. Right-click the *Certificates* folder, and select *All tasks \> Import.*

   1. Select the file where you saved the certificate details. This will load the certificate into the certificate store.

1. Update the Windows hosts file:

   1. Open `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`.

   1. At the bottom, add a line with the IP address of the SMSEagle device, followed by a space and the word "smseagle"

      Example: *10.3.1.41 smseagle*

   1. Save and close the hosts file.

1. To check if the certificate was correctly installed, open an internet browser, and go to `https://smseagle/login`. If no "invalid certificate" errors appear, the certificate was correctly installed.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - In production environments, it is recommended to use the domain certificate of the network (e.g. smseagle.skyline.be) and to generate a server certificate for the SMSEagle device that is trusted by the root skyline.be certificate.
> - The SMSEagle firmware supports HTTPS as from version 2.7.
> - When an SMSEagle device with firmware version 3.32 is used, because of an issue with this firmware version, it is not possible to retrieve the signal strength.
