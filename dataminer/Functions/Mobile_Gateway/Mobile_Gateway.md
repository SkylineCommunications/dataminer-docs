# DataMiner Mobile Gateway

DataMiner Mobile Gateway features support for two-way communication with mobile phones via SMS text messages. For quick interventions in case of emergencies, users can be alerted via text message and quickly adjust the value of any parameter on any device, depending on their user permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> DataMiner Mobile Gateway is only available on DMAs with a Mobile Gateway Server license. Though the Mobile Gateway options will still be displayed even if you do not have this license, you will not be able to use a Mobile Gateway.
