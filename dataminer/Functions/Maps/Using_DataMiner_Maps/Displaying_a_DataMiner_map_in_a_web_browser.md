# Displaying a DataMiner map in a web browser

1. Open a web browser.

1. Enter the mapâ€™s address in the address bar:

    ```txt
    http://[DMA]/maps/map.aspx?config=[configuration file]
    ```

1. Press ENTER.

> [!TIP]
> See also: [Switching map configurations by means of JavaScript](xref:Switching_map_configurations_by_means_of_JavaScript)

> [!NOTE]
> You can override the initial center latitude and longitude defined in the map configuration using the "lat" and "long" URL arguments.

Examples:

- To display a DataMiner map using the settings specified in a configuration file named *mymap.xml*, enter the following address in the address bar of your web browser:

  ```txt
  http://MyDma/maps/map.aspx?config=mymap
  ```

- To display a map using the settings specified in a configuration file named *ExampleConfig.xml*, but with a custom center latitude and longitude:

  ```txt
  http://MyDma/maps/map.aspx?config=ExampleConfig&lat=42&long=12.30
  ```

## Displaying a DataMiner Map in a Visio file

1. In a Microsoft Visio file, draw the shape in which you want the DataMiner map to be displayed.

1. Add a shape data item of type **Link** to the shape, and set its value to:

    ```txt
    #http://[DMA]/maps/map.aspx?config=[configuration file]
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> The # character in front of the address will make sure the DataMiner Map is displayed inside the shape you have drawn. If you do not type the # character in front of the address, the DataMiner Map will be displayed in a new web browser window when you click the shape.
