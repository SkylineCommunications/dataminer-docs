# Selecting a matrix

At the top of the *Router Control* module, underneath the gray header area, you will find a list of all matrix elements in the DataMiner System. Click one of them, and the default configuration (i.e. user interface) for that particular matrix will appear:

- At the top: a grid with all the inputs.

- At the bottom: a grid with all the outputs.

- At the center:

  - two information panels (the left one showing information about the selected input, and the right one showing information about the selected output), and

  - three buttons ([Connect](xref:Connecting_an_output_to_an_input), [Disconnect](xref:Disconnecting_an_output_from_an_input), and [Lock](xref:Locking_an_output), [Unlock](xref:Unlocking_an_output) or *N/A*).

> [!NOTE]
> The *N/A* button is displayed if no input or output is selected. Otherwise, *Lock* or *Unlock* is displayed, depending on whether an input and output are already locked.
