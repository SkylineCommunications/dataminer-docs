# DataMiner Router Control

DataMiner Router Control is a DataMiner module that allows you to intuitively configure the matrices in your DataMiner System in a single, customizable user interface.

When you open the module for the first time, you will find a default user interface (called a configuration) that contains a tab page for every standard matrix found in your DMS. If no standard matrices have been defined yet, a message will be displayed instead.

Next to the default configuration, you can [create additional configurations](xref:Creating_and_customizing_Router_Control_configurations). All configurations (including the default) can be customized.

> [!NOTE]
> Only [standard matrix parameters](xref:UIComponentsMatrix) are supported in Router Control. [Table-based matrix parameters](xref:UIComponentsTableMatrix) can only be viewed in Data Display.
