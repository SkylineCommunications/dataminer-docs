# About the Resources module

The Resources module is usually used as part of the [Service & Resource Management Framework](xref:About_SRM).

You can find this module in DataMiner Cube by selecting *Apps* > *Modules* > *Resources* in the sidebar.

It can be used to get an overview of the available resources and resource pools in the system and to configure these.

> [!NOTE]
> This module requires [STaaS](xref:STaaS) (recommended) or a [self-managed DataMiner storage setup](xref:Supported_system_data_storage_architectures) with Cassandra-compatible database and indexing database.
