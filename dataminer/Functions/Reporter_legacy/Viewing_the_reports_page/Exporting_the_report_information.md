# Exporting the report information

For each of the graphs, the information can be exported as a .csv file.

To do so:

1. Click the spreadsheet icon in the lower-right corner next to the graph.

1. Browse to the location where you want to save the exported file, optionally specify a custom file name, and click *Save*.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the CSV separator is the separator defined in the Cube user settings. See [Regional settings](xref:User_settings#regional-settings). If this setting cannot be retrieved, the system will fall back to the Windows regional settings on the DataMiner Agent.
