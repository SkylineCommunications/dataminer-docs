# Working with custom report templates in a third-party editor

The report templates you create in the Reporter app using the built-in template editor (which is accessible via *Start \> Apps \> Reports & Dashboards* or via *http(s)://\[MyDataMiner\]/reports*) are Classic ASP pages that call JScript methods from the DMS Reporter Framework. On a DataMiner Agent, they are stored in the following folder: `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Webpages\Reports\templates`.

Alternatively, you can also create report templates using your favorite ASP editor and then manually add them to the list of available templates.
