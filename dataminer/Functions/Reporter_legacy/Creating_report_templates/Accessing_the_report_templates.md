# Accessing the report templates

To go to the report templates page:

1. Open the Reporter app:

   - In DataMiner Cube, go to *Apps* > *Reports & Dashboards*, or

   - Go directly to the link`https://[MyDataMiner]/reports` or `http://[MyDataMiner]/reports`, depending on your setup.

1. In the navigation menu on the left, click *Reports*.

   Alternatively, you can also click the *Templates* tab on the *System* page.

On the report templates page, you can:

- Edit report templates, by clicking the pencil icon in the top-right corner of the template.

- Delete report templates, by clicking the x in the top-right corner of the template.

- Add new report templates. See [Adding a new report template](xref:Adding_a_new_report_template).

- Generate reports based on custom templates. See [Report template components](xref:Report_template_components).

> [!NOTE]
> The Reporter user interface functions as a single-page application. This means that when you work with the *http(s)://\[MyDataMiner\]/reports* page, you can bookmark the URL of a particular report, or copy the URL in order to make a direct link to the report, for example in Visual Overview.
