# Viewing the built-in reports in the Reporter app

To view the built-in reports in the Reporter app:

- In DataMiner Cube, go to *Apps* > *Reports & Dashboards*, or

- Go directly to the link `https://[MyDataMiner]/reports` or `http://[MyDataMiner]/reports`, depending on your setup, or

- To go directly to a particular type of built-in report, use that report’s URL as indicated below. Note that depending on your setup, you may need to use https instead of http in the indicated URLs.

In the navigation menu on the left, you can see an overview of the available reports and dashboards. The pages at the top of the navigation menu contain the built-in reports. With the view filter in the top-right corner, you can display information for certain views only.

- [System reports](xref:System_reports)

- [Element reports](xref:Element_reports)

- [Service reports](xref:Service_reports)

- [Business reports](xref:Business_reports)

- [Booking reports](xref:Booking_reports)

- [Using the View filter for built-in reports](xref:Using_the_View_filter_for_built-in_reports#using-the-view-filter-for-built-in-reports)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The *Reports* section below the built-in reports contains custom report templates, and allows the creation of report templates. See [Creating report templates](xref:Creating_report_templates).
> - If you do not have the necessary rights to view certain elements or services, you will not be able to view information on these elements or services in reports.
> - The Reporter user interface functions as a single-page application. This means that when you work with the *http(s)://\[MyDataMiner\]/reports* page, you can bookmark the URL of a particular report, or copy the URL in order to make a direct link to the report, for example in Visual Overview.
