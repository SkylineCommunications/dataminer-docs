# Viewing the built-in reports in the Reporter app

To view the built-in reports in the Reporter app:

- In DataMiner Cube, go to *Apps* > *Reports & Dashboards*, or

- Go directly to the link `https://[MyDataMiner]/reports` or `http://[MyDataMiner]/reports`, depending on your setup, or

- To go directly to a particular type of built-in report, use that report’s URL as indicated below. Note that depending on your setup, you may need to use https instead of http in the indicated URLs.

  > [!CAUTION]
  > If you use a DataMiner version prior to DataMiner 10.1.7, we strongly advise that you use HTTPS when you use DataMiner client applications over public internet. If you do not do so, all information – including logon credentials – is sent as plain, unencrypted text over the internet. From DataMiner 10.1.7 onwards, client-server communication is encrypted by default. See also: [Setting up HTTPS on a DMA](xref:Setting_up_HTTPS_on_a_DMA).

In the navigation menu on the left, you can see an overview of the available reports and dashboards. The pages at the top of the navigation menu contain the built-in reports. With the view filter in the top-right corner, you can display information for certain views only.

- [System reports](xref:System_reports)

- [Element reports](xref:Element_reports)

- [Service reports](xref:Service_reports)

- [Business reports](xref:Business_reports)

- [Booking reports](xref:Booking_reports)

- [Using the View filter for built-in reports](xref:Using_the_View_filter_for_built-in_reports#using-the-view-filter-for-built-in-reports)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The *Reports* section below the built-in reports contains custom report templates, and allows the creation of report templates. See [Creating report templates](xref:Creating_report_templates).
> - If you do not have the necessary rights to view certain elements or services, you will not be able to view information on these elements or services in reports.
> - The Reporter user interface functions as a single-page application. This means that when you work with the *http(s)://\[MyDataMiner\]/reports* page, you can bookmark the URL of a particular report, or copy the URL in order to make a direct link to the report, for example in Visual Overview.
