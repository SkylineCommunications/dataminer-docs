# DMS Reporter

DMS Reporter is a legacy module that allows you to view built-in reports and create custom reports, which can then be viewed online or sent by email. In recent DataMiner versions, this module has been replaced by the [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D).

> [!NOTE]
> This module is by default disabled from DataMiner 10.4.0/10.4.1 onwards.<!-- RN 37786 --> If you want to keep using it, you need to enable it with the [*LegacyReportsAndDashboards* soft-launch option](xref:Overview_of_Soft_Launch_Options#legacyreportsanddashboards). Prior to this, starting from DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.12, the legacy Reporter module can optionally be disabled with this soft-launch option.

> [!CAUTION]
> This module is being retired. For more detailed information, see [DataMiner functionality evolution and retirement](xref:Software_support_life_cycles#dataminer-functionality-evolution-and-retirement). ![EOL](~/dataminer/images/EOL_Duo.png)
