# Generating a report with the Reporter app

To generate a report using the Reporter app:

1. Go to the report templates page. See [Accessing the report templates](xref:Accessing_the_report_templates).

1. Click any of the available custom report templates.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also directly click a report template name in the navigation menu; however, you will only be able to set the elements, parameters, etc. to be included in the report if the link in the navigation menu links to the template, rather than directly to the report. For more information, see [Adding a new report template](xref:Adding_a_new_report_template).

1. If you want to apply default options that were previously saved for this report, click *Load default options*. If so, skip to step 8.

1. Optionally, enter a title and message to show at the top of the report.

1. Select the views, elements, parameters, etc. as required for the report.

1. Choose whether to generate an HTML or PDF report.

1. For tables or graphs, optionally select to export these as .ods, .csv, or .xml, instead of generating a full report.

1. If you want to keep these options as default options for the report, click *Save As Default Options*.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If default options have been saved for a report template and you go directly to a report using a link in the navigation menu, the default options will be loaded automatically.

1. Click *Generate* to generate the report.
