# Adding a field

The DOM Editor allows you to add a field to an existing section definition. This is possible even when there are instances of that specific object already.

1. In the Automation app in DataMiner Cube, run the *DOM Editor* script. You can find this script in the folder `DOM\DOM Main scripts`.

   The script window will show a list of the available modules, as well as several buttons.

1. Next to the module in which you want to add a field, click *Edit*.

   A window with four buttons will be displayed.

1. Click *Section Definitions*.

1. Click *Edit* next to the section definition you want to add the field to.

1. Click *Field Descriptors*, and click the *+* button.

1. Fill in the necessary information for the field and click *Back*.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you add a mandatory field, whenever an existing instance is saved, that added mandatory field will need to be filled in.

1. Click *Back* again and then click *Apply* and *OK*.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also add a new section to an existing module and add new fields to that. See [Adding a section](xref:DOM_editor_adding_section).
