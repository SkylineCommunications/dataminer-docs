# Dom helper class

## CRUD methods

The `DomHelper` class can be used in a script, protocol, or app to execute create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) actions on DOM objects.
See the [CRUD methods](xref:DOM_helper_crud_methods) sub-page for all the info on how the helper and all its functionality can be used.

## Special methods

In addition to the CRUD methods, the following special methods are also supported on a `DomInstance` CRUD helper component:

- DoStatusTransition: Used to transition a `DomInstance` from one status to another. See [DOM status system](xref:DOM_status_system).

- ExecuteAction: Used to execute an action in the context of a `DomInstance` that was defined on a `DomBehaviorDefinition`. See [DOM actions](xref:DOM_actions).

## Stitching

The stitching functionality makes it easier to work with a `DomInstance`. With this, there is no need to use the helper each time and retrieve the linked objects using an ID filter. When a `DomInstance` is stitched, it is possible to:

- Retrieve the full `DomDefinition` object that the `DomInstance` is linked to, by calling `GetDomDefinition()` on the instance.
- Retrieve the full `SectionDefinition` object that a `Section` is linked to, by calling `GetSectionDefinition()` on the `Section`
- Retrieve the full `FieldDescriptor` object that a `FieldValue` is linked to, by calling `GetFieldDescriptor()` on the `FieldValue`.

> [!NOTE]
> When an item is not stitched, and one of the above-mentioned get methods is called (e.g., GetDomDefinition), an exception will be thrown.

There are two ways to stitch DOM instances:

- `DomHelper.StitchDomInstances(List<DomInstance> domInstances)`: This will stitch the given list of `DomInstances` by retrieving all objects from the server using the SLNet callback on the helper.

- `DomHelper.StitchDomInstances(List<DomInstance> domInstances, List<SectionDefinition> existingSectionDefinitions, List<DomDefinition> existingDomDefinitions)`: This will stitch the given list of `DomInstances` by trying to retrieve the other objects from the given lists. This is a more efficient option when you already have all necessary objects.

> [!NOTE]
> If stitching is used and an object cannot be found, a null value will be assigned to the related property. The `DomInstance` will still be marked as stitched. This way, when that property is retrieved, you can know it is not available.
>
> For example: If the second of the two methods above is used, but the provided `existingDomDefinitions` list is empty, the stitching logic will not be able to find the `DomDefinition` object linked to the instance. When you try to retrieve the `DomDefinition` using the `DomInstance.GetDomDefinition()` method, "null" will be returned.

## Attachments

From DataMiner 10.1.3/10.2.0 onwards, it is possible to save attachments with the `DomHelper`. These are linked to a `DomInstanceId`. You can use the `Attachments` helper on the `DomInstance` CRUD component.

```csharp
var domHelper = new DomHelper(engine.SendSLNetMessages, PermissionTestModuleId);
var fileBytes = File.ReadAllBytes("C:\MyDocuments\ImportantDocument.txt");

// Adding an attachment
domHelper.DomInstances.Attachments.Add(domInstanceId, "ImportantDocument.txt", fileBytes);

// Get the names of all attachments
List<string> fileNames = domHelper.DomInstances.Attachments.GetFileNames(domInstanceId);

// Get the content of an attachment
byte[] file = domHelper.DomInstances.Attachments.Get(domInstanceId, "ImportantDocument.txt");

// Delete an attachment
domHelper.DomInstances.Attachments.Delete(domInstanceId, "ImportantDocument.txt");
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The size limit of the attachments is determined by the [Documents.MaxSize](xref:MaintenanceSettings.Documents.MaxSize) setting in *MaintenanceSettings.xml*. The default value for this is 20 MB. Trying to upload a larger file using the helper will result in a `DataMinerException`.
> - Deleting a `DomInstance` will delete all attachments from the file system. The attachments cannot be recovered.
> - To view or download `DomInstance` attachments, read permission is required, and to add or edit them, edit permission is required.
> - To include `DomInstance` attachments in a [custom backup](xref:Backing_up_a_DataMiner_Agent_in_DataMiner_Cube#configuring-the-dataminer-backups) in Cube, select *All documents located on this DMA*.
> - The attachments are synced in the DMS.
