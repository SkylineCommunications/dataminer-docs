# DomInstanceHistorySettings

>[!NOTE]
> From 10.4.4/10.5.0 onwards<!-- RN38294 -->, it is possible to override this setting on `DomDefinition` level with the [ModuleSettingsOverrides](xref:DomDefinition#modulesettingsoverrides) property.

The `DomInstanceHistorySettings` object is introduced in DataMiner version 10.3.9/10.4.0<!-- RN 36785 --> and contains the settings related to the DOM instance history. It currently includes the option to alter the history saving behavior.

## StorageBehavior

The `StorageBehavior` property of type `DomInstanceHistoryStorageBehavior` allows you to define how the DOM instance history objects should be saved. The following options are available:

- **EnabledAsync**: The DOM instance history objects will be stored or deleted asynchronously, and DOM instance create, update, or delete calls will not be blocked until the database operation for the history object is completed. This improves the performance of the DOM instance calls. This is the default option.
- **EnabledSync**: The DOM instance history objects will be stored or deleted synchronously, and DOM instance create, update, or delete calls will be blocked until the database operation for the history object is completed. With this option, you can read the most recent history record from an update right after the call for that update returns. This option should be avoided, as this impacts the DOM instance call performance.
- **Disabled**: The DOM instance history will not be stored or deleted. Any existing history for this manager will not be deleted when the associated DOM instance is deleted. This option is recommended when no history is needed, as it reduces the load on the database and the storage required.
