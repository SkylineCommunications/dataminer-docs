# Working with the Experience and Performance Management user interface

The user interface of an EPM element (formerly known as CPE Manager) can be very different depending on your configuration, your DataMiner version, and the protocol used for the EPM Manager elements. However, there are some aspects that return for all EPM elements. These are detailed in the following topics:

- [Accessing the Experience and Performance Management user interface](xref:Accessing_the_Experience_and_Performance_Management_user_interface)

- [Using the EPM Topology app](xref:EPM_Topology_app)

- [EPM user interface components](xref:EPM_user_interface_components)

- [Using the EPM filter section](xref:Using_the_EPM_filter_section)

- [Using the EPM overview section](xref:Using_the_EPM_overview_section)

- [EPM alarm monitoring and trending](xref:EPM_alarm_monitoring_and_trending)

- [Creating a link between DataMiner elements and the EPM element](xref:Creating_a_link_between_DataMiner_elements_and_the_EPM_element)
