# DataMiner Experience and Performance Management

DataMiner Experience and Performance Management (EPM), previously known as Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) Management, is a software platform specifically designed to manage very high volumes of devices in cable, telco, terrestrial and satellite environments.

The platform enables operators to collect valuable operational data from each relevant object in their ecosystem and to optimize the service quality and availability.

DataMiner Experience and Performance Management can be deployed as a standalone platform with northbound interfaces for integration with your OSS/BSS. However, it can also be fully integrated into a DataMiner System.
