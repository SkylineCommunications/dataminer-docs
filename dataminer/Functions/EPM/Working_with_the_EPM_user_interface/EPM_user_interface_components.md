# EPM user interface components

The interface usually consists of the following components:

- At the top of an EPM card, there are several tabs, known as “chains”, which you can navigate between.

- At the left-hand side is a filter section, which you can use to navigate to specific objects in the topology.

- At the right-hand side, a large pane provides an overview of whatever object is selected in the currently selected chain.

- In the lower-right corner, a panel shows detailed information about the objects in the overview pane. To copy this information to the clipboard, click *Copy data to clipboard*.

> [!NOTE]
> You can adjust the width of the filter pane and the width and height of the details pane, by placing the mouse pointer on the edge of the pane and dragging. For each of the chains, the size of the panes is stored in the user settings.
