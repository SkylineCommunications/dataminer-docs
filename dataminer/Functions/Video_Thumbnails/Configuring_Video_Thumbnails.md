# Configuring video thumbnails

You can configure a video thumbnail in two main places: in Visual Overview (Visio shapes rendered in DataMiner Cube) and in the web component (Dashboards and Low‑Code Apps).

Both approaches rely on the same underlying mechanism: linking a shape or component to the *VideoThumbnails* webpage and specifying the required video type, source URL, and additional parameters (optional).
