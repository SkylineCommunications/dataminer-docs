# About video thumbnails

A video thumbnail is a built-in DataMiner feature that allows you to display a video feed or regularly refreshed image [in a Visio shape in Visual Overview](xref:Configuring_a_video_thumbnail_in_Visio) and [in a web component](xref:Configuring_a_video_thumbnail_in_a_web_component) in Dashboards and Low-Code Apps.

The thumbnail is generated by a dedicated internal webpage hosted by the DataMiner Agent:

```txt
http(s)://<DMAIP>/VideoThumbnails/Video.htm?VideoServerParameters
```

The `VideoServerParameters` determine the type of feed, source URL, optional authentication, and rendering behavior. You can use placeholders to build dynamic URLs.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the *EscapeDataString* placeholder when you add parameters, properties or other DataMiner data sources in the URL (see [\[EscapeDataString:x\]](xref:Placeholders_for_variables_in_shape_data_values#escapedatastringx)). For example: `https://<DMAIP>/VideoThumbnails/Video.htm?type=Generic%20VLC&source=[EscapeDataString:[param:*,10014]]`

Both Visual Overview and the web component embed this webpage: Visual Overview through the *Link* shape data field, and the web component through its *URL* setting. For detailed instructions, see:
