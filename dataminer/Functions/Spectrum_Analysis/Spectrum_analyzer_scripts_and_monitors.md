# Spectrum analyzer scripts and monitors

Apart from real-time remote interaction, DataMiner Spectrum Analysis also offers around-the-clock performance monitoring. Thanks to extensive, but highly intuitive scripting capabilities, administrators can automate just about every measurement that an operator would perform manually.

Automated RF performance measuring allows operators to track vital RF parameters (such as Eb/No, carrier levels, C/N, carrier power, average power, ...) and to generate alarms whenever one of those parameters goes out of range. It also allows them to perform a long-term trend analysis on those parameters in order to identify emerging problems before they affect services.

DataMinerâ€™s automated performance monitoring is based on the one hand on scripts, which define what needs to be measured, and on the other hand on monitors, which define when the scripts need to be executed and how.
