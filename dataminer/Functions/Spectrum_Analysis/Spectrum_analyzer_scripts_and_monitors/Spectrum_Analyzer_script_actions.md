# Spectrum Analyzer script actions

When you add action lines to a spectrum analyzer script, a vast array of actions is available. You can select this in the *Operation* drop-down list in the *Edit Monitor Script* pane. When you select an action, a brief description is shown below, and the input fields for the statement are adjusted to the selected action.

> [!NOTE]
> Some actions only become available if certain other actions have been used earlier in the script. E.g. the *Check Threshold* action is not available unless an action *Get Threshold* is used first.

## Variables

Below, the following abbreviations will be used to indicate the different types of variables in the script actions.

| Variable | Description                                      |

| b        | condition (true/false)                           |

## Actions

The following table provides an overview of the available actions in spectrum scripts. For some of the actions, more information is provided below the table.
