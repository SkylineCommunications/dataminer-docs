# Searching the database

To search the entire database for a particular word:

- Enter a search term in the *Search* box, which is located in the top-left corner of the *Asset Manager* user interface.

    The search results will appear in the tree structure on the left.

In addition, you can filter a table in the data pane:

- To filter a table to only show certain items, enter a search term in the filter box in the top-right corner, just above the table.

- To remove the filter again, click the X in the filter box.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If a filter has been applied to a table and you switch between tables, the filter will also be applied on the newly selected table.
