  1. Click the *Edit row* button.

  1. Make the necessary changes and click *Apply*.

- From a table row in the *All linked items* view:

  1. In the overview pane on the left, select the table row.

  1. If not in *All linked items* view, click *All linked items* at the top of the data pane.

  1. Select the row again in the pane on the right, and click the *Edit row* button.

  1. Make the necessary changes and click *Apply*.

- From the table row in the *Row View*:

  1. In the overview pane on the left, select the table row.

  1. If not in *Row View*, click *Row View* at the top of the data pane.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - When you select a table in the tree structure on the left, you can update data directly in the table grid on the right. Just click inside a cell and change its value.
> - If a field in a row has a link to a foreign table, the possible values are shown in a combo box. You can also add a new row to the foreign table by selecting *Add new row* in the combo box.
> - It is not possible to edit fields containing a primary key. Editing of foreign keys is only possible via the *Edit row* button.
> - Values in columns of type "Bool" and of type "Enum" are displayed as checkboxes and as selection boxes, respectively.
