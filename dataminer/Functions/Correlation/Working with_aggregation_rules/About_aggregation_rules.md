# About aggregation rules

With aggregation rules, you can calculate statistical information within your DataMiner System. This makes it easy to, for example, monitor large volumes of devices from a statistical perspective, or monitor evolutions in your operation.

The rules can calculate data based on real-time parameter values or alarm states, with or without conditions. The rules themselves can be monitored and trended like regular parameters. The results of the calculations are also accessible in other DataMiner applications, such as Reports & Dashboards.

The Aggregation UI itself is accessible from view cards. However, Aggregation is considered part of the *Correlation* module as far as licensing and user permissions are concerned.
