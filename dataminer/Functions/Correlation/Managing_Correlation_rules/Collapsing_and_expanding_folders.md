# Collapsing and expanding folders

You can collapse or expand folders in the tree view of the Correlation module:

- By clicking the triangle in front of the folder.

- By right-clicking the tree view and selecting *Collapse all* or *Expand all*.

- By selecting the folder, clicking the More... button at the bottom of the pane, and selecting *Collapse all* or *Expand all*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you select *Collapse all*, the root folder will not be collapsed.
