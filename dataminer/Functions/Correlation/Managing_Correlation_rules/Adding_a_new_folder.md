# Adding a new folder

To add a new folder in the Correlation module:

- Click the *New Folder* button at the bottom of the pane, or

- Right-click the folder where you want a new folder and select *New folder*.

> [!NOTE]
> If you create a new folder, it will only be saved if a rule is added to it. Empty folders are automatically deleted when you close the *Correlation* module.
