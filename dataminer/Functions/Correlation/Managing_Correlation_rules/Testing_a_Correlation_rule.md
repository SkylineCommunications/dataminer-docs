# Testing a correlation rule

To test a correlation rule in DataMiner Cube:

1. In the *Correlation* module, select the rule in question in the tree view.

1. In the details pane, click the *Test rule* button.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the rule contains errors, the button will be disabled.

1. Specify the time range for the historical alarms against which the rule is to be tested, and click *Test*.

   The results, i.e. the correlated alarms and the corresponding base alarms, will be displayed in the *test results* window.

> [!NOTE]
> The *Test rule* button is not available for rules created with the deprecated System Display Correlation engine.
