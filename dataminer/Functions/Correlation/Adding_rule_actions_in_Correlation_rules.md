# Adding rule actions in correlation rules

In the *Correlation* module in Cube, select a rule in the tree view pane on the left in order to add rule actions to it in the details pane on the right.

In the *Actions* section of the details pane, specify the actions that will be executed when the correlation rule is triggered.

There are several possible types of actions:

- Acknowledging a base alarm. See [Acknowledging a base alarm](xref:Acknowledging_a_base_alarm).

- Creating a ticket (soft-launch option). See [Creating a ticket](xref:Creating_a_ticket).

- Escalating an event. See [Escalating an event](xref:Escalating_an_event).

- Creating a new, correlated alarm. See [Triggering a correlated alarm](xref:Triggering_a_correlated_alarm).

- Running an automation script. See [Running an automation script from a correlation rule](xref:Running_an_Automation_script_from_a_Correlation_rule).

- Sending an email. See [Sending an email](xref:Sending_an_email).

- Sending a text message. See [Sending a text message](xref:Sending_a_text_message).

- Setting a parameter. See [Triggering a parameter set](xref:Triggering_a_parameter_set).

These actions can be combined, so that they will be triggered in a particular order. To change the order of the actions:

- Hover the mouse pointer over the actions and move them up or down in the list using the upward or downward triangles.

To delete an action:

- Hover the mouse pointer over the action and click the X.
