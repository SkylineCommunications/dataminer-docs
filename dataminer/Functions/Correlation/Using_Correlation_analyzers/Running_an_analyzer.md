# Running an analyzer

To run a Correlation analyzer:

1. In the Correlation module, select the analyzer in the tree view of the *analyzers* pane.

1. Click the *Start analyzing* button at the bottom of the details pane.

1. If the option *Enable real-time analyzing* was not selected, select a time range for the history alarms you want to analyze and click *Apply*.

   While the analyzer is working, its status will change from *Idle* to *Collecting*.

1. To stop real-time analyzing, click *Stop analyzing*. Analysis of history alarms will stop automatically as soon as the analyzer is ready.

   The status of the analyzer will return to *Idle*, and a correlation rule will be proposed under *Results*.

1. To view the proposed Correlation rule, right-click the result and select *Add to correlation*.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The new correlation rule is not automatically enabled and saved.
