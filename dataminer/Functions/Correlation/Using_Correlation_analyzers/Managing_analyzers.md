# Managing analyzers

Like the main Correlation module, the *Analyzers* tab consists of a tree structure on the left, and a detailed view on the right. The way the different available analyzers are managed is very similar to the management of correlation rules in the *Correlation* tab.

- To add or delete folders and analyzers, use the buttons at the bottom of the tree view pane .

    Alternatively, you can also use the right-click menu to do this.

- To duplicate an analyzer, right-click it and select *Duplicate*.

- Drag and drop analyzers to move them to and from folders in the tree view.

- To collapse all folders in the tree view or expand all folders in the tree view, right-click a folder and select *Collapse all* or *Expand all* respectively.
