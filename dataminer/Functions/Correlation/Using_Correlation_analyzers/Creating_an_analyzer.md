# Creating an analyzer

There are two ways to create a Correlation analyzer:

- In the *Analyzers* tab of the *Correlation* module, click the *Add analyzer* button.

- In the Surveyor, right-click an element or view for which you wish to create an analyzer, and select *Actions \> Analyze*.

You will then be able to further configure the analyzer. See [Configuring an analyzer](xref:Configuring_an_analyzer).
