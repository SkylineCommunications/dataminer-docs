# Sharing a dashboard as a PDF report from the Dashboards app

> [!NOTE]
> From DataMiner 10.2.2/10.2.0 onwards, you can generate a PDF report in the Dashboards app if the *ReportsAndDashboardsExport* [soft-launch option](xref:SoftLaunchOptions) is activated. From DataMiner 10.2.12/10.3.0 onwards, this feature is fully available.

To share a dashboard as a PDF report in the Dashboards app:

## [From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.3 onwards](#tab/tabid-1)

1. Click the ... button in the top-right corner of the dashboard, and select *Share*.

   > [!NOTE]
   > From DataMiner 10.2.12/10.3.0 onwards, the *Share* button is only available in read mode.

1. Click *Email report*.

1. In the *To* box, specify the email address(es) you want to send the PDF report to.

1. Optionally, specify additional addresses in the *CC* and *BCC* boxes.

1. In the *Subject* box, specify the subject for the email.

1. Optionally, in the *Message* box, add the message body for the email.

1. To include a CSV file for each component of the dashboard, select *Include CSV*. This is only supported for specific components, such as the line graph, pivot table, and table component.
