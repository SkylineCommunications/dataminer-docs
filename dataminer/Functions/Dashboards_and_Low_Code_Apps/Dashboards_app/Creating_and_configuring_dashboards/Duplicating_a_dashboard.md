1. To modify the folder that should contain the duplicated dashboard, specify the folder name in the *Location* box, or select the folder in the tree view below this box.

   By default, the folder containing the dashboard you duplicated is selected.

   You can also create folders at this point, by hovering the mouse pointer over the folder in the tree view where you want to create a folder and clicking the + icon. Then specify the folder name and click the check mark icon.

1. In the *Security* box, select whether other users should be able to view and edit the dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
> The following characters are not allowed in the name of a dashboard or dashboard folder: / \\ : ; \* ? \< \> \| °

> If you do specify a backslash (“\\”) in a folder name, this will not become part of the folder name. Instead, a subfolder will be created, with the characters after the backslash as its name.
