# Managing dashboard folders

## Adding a folder

1. In case you want to create the folder within an existing folder, select that existing folder. Otherwise, make sure no folder is selected. You can do so by clicking the *Dashboards* button in the header bar.

1. Either right-click the dashboards list or click the ... button in the top-right corner of the list and select *New folder*.

1. Specify the name of the folder and click *Create* or *OK*, depending on your DataMiner version.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - A dashboard folder name must not start with a space.
   > - The following characters are not allowed in a dashboard folder name:
   >
   >   / \\ : ; \* ? \< \> \| °
   >
   > - If you do specify a backslash (“\\”) in a folder name, this will not become part of the folder name. Instead a subfolder will be created, with the characters after the backslash as its name.

1. From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU20]/10.4.0 [CU8]/10.4.11 onwards <!--RN 40600-->, you can select whether other users should be able to view and edit the folder in the *Security* box.

   > [!NOTE]
   > - Once the folder has been created, you can further refine which users have which level of access in the dashboard folder options. See [Changing dashboard settings](xref:Configuring_dashboard_security).
   > - The built-in Administrator account always has full access to all folders.

## Deleting a folder

1. Select the folder in the navigation pane.

1. Either right-click the folder in the dashboards list or click the ... button in the top-right corner of the list and select *Delete*.

1. Click OK to confirm the deletion.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - When you delete a folder, any dashboards or folders within that folder will also be deleted.
> - If a folder contains a dashboard you are not allowed to modify, you will not be able to delete that folder.

## Renaming a folder

1. Select the folder in the navigation pane.

1. Either right-click the folder in the dashboards list or click the ... button in the top-right corner of the list. From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.3 onwards<!--RN 38278-->, select *Settings*. Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.3, select *Rename*.

1. Enter a new folder name, and click *Apply* or *OK*, depending on your DataMiner version.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - When you rename a folder, the location and URL of all dashboards in that folder and any of its subfolders will automatically be adapted.
> - If a folder contains a dashboard you are not allowed to modify, you will not be able to rename that folder.
