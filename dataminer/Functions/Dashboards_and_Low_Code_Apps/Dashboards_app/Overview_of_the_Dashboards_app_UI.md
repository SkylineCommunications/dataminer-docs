The list gets updated with new suggestions as you type. Select a suggestion in the list to open the corresponding dashboard or dashboard folder.

- WebSocket connection status: Available from DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU13]/10.4.0 [CU1]/10.4.4<!--RN 38676--> up to DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU10]/10.5.1. This indicator shows the current status of your WebSocket connection. The available statuses include:

## The Dashboards app sidebar

| ![Private dashboards icon](~/dataminer/images/DashboardsX_private.png) | Displays a list of private dashboards. These are dashboards that can only be accessed by specific users (configured in the [dashboard settings](xref:Configuring_dashboard_security)). This icon is displayed from DataMiner 10.2.7/10.3.0 onwards if there are private dashboards available. |
| ![Shared dashboards icon](~/dataminer/images/DashboardsX_shared.png) | Displays a list of dashboards that have been shared via dataminer.services. This icon is displayed from DataMiner 10.2.7/10.3.0 onwards if there are shared dashboards available. |

Right-click in either of the panes or click the ... button to open a menu with the following options:

- *Open in new tab*: Opens the selected dashboard in a new browser tab.

- *Create folder* or *New folder*: Adds a new folder in the selected folder.

- *Create dashboard* or *New dashboard*: Adds a new dashboard. By default, it will be added in the selected folder, but a different folder can be specified. See [Creating a completely new dashboard](xref:Creating_a_completely_new_dashboard).

  The pop-up window also contains the option *Preserve feed selections*. When this option is selected, any selection you make in a dashboard in the folder is preserved when you navigate to another dashboard in the folder. Note that this only applies to the folder itself, not to any other folders it may contain.

- *Rename*: Only available if a non-shared dashboard is selected, or if a folder is selected prior to DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.12. Allows you to rename the dashboard or folder. Obsolete from DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.3 onwards<!--RN 38278-->.

Opens a pop-up window where you can rename or move a dashboard or folder, or edit access to the dashboard or folder. See [Managing dashboard folders](xref:Managing_dashboard_folders).

  When a dashboard folder is selected and the parameter *showAdvancedSettings=true* has been added to the URL, the pop-up window also contains the option *Preserve selections*. Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9]/10.4.12, this option is labeled *Preserve feed selections*. When this option is selected, any selection you make in a dashboard in the folder is preserved when you navigate to another dashboard in the folder. Note that this only applies to the folder itself, not to any other folders it may contain.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU20]/10.4.0 [CU8]/10.4.11<!--RN 40709-->, the *Preserve feed selections* option is available in the settings pop-up window regardless of whether the *showAdvancedSettings=true* parameter is present in the URL.

- *Delete*: Only available if a dashboard or folder is selected. See [Deleting a dashboard](xref:Deleting_a_dashboard).

## The Dashboards app details pane

The large pane on the right shows any folder or dashboard selected in the navigation pane.

If no dashboard is selected, buttons are available that allow you to create a new blank dashboard, to create a dashboard based on an example or to navigate to a recently used dashboard.

If an empty folder is selected, buttons are available that allow you to create or import a dashboard directly in that folder.

If a dashboard is selected, the header bar of this pane can display a number of buttons, depending on the dashboard and the settings of the app:

- Refresh button ![Refresh button](~/dataminer/images/DashboardsX_refresh.png) : Loads the most recent data in the displayed dashboard.

- **Start editing**: Allows you to start editing the dashboard. In edit mode, the navigation pane on the left will be hidden.

- **Stop editing**: Closes edit mode.

- **Clear selections**<!--RN 41141-->/**Clear all**: Only displayed if the dashboard contains at least one component. Clears the selection of all the data in the dashboard.

- **PDF**: Available from DataMiner 10.2.12/10.3.0 onwards. Only displayed in read mode. Allows you to export the dashboard as a PDF file.

- **Share** or **Start sharing**: Allows you to share the dashboard using dataminer.services. See [Sharing a dashboard](xref:Sharing_a_dashboard). This feature is only available in read mode, if the DataMiner System is connected to dataminer.services. See [Connecting your DataMiner System to dataminer.services](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud).

In the [settings of the Dashboards app](#the-dashboards-app-header-bar), you can configure whether the edit mode, clear selections, export as PDF, and share dashboard buttons are always displayed (i.e. “pinned” to the header bar) or instead accessible via a button in the top-right corner of a dashboard.
