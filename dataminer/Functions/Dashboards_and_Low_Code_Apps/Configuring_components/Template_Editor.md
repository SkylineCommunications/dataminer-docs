# Using the Template Editor

Available from DataMiner 10.4.1/10.5.0 onwards.

The Template Editor allows you to **design and customize the layout of supported components** in your dashboards and low-code apps. It offers a flexible layer-based interface where you can add icons, text, shapes, and HTML content, apply conditions, and configure styling and actions. This gives you full control over how data is visually represented in your dashboards and low-code apps.

![Template Editor](~/dataminer/images/TemplateEditor.png)<br>*Template Editor in DataMiner 10.5.8*

The Template Editor is currently supported for the following components:

- [Grid](xref:DashboardGrid)
- [Timeline](xref:DashboardTimeline)
- [Table](xref:DashboardTable)
- [Maps](xref:DashboardMaps)

## Accessing the Template Editor

The way you can access the Template Editor depends on the type of component:

### [Grid and timeline](#tab/grid-timeline)

1. Select the component and go to the *Layout* pane on the right.

1. In the *Item templates* section, click *Edit*.

   > [!NOTE]
   > A preview of the template currently used for this component is displayed in the *Item templates* section.

### [Table](#tab/table)

1. Select the table component and go to the *Layout* pane on the right.

1. In the *Column appearance* section, click the downward arrow next to *Select a column* and select the column you want to create a template for.

1. Click the ellipsis button ("...") in the top-right corner and select *Customize preset*.

### [Maps](#tab/maps)

1. Select the maps component and go to the *Layout* pane on the right.

1. Under the *Layer settings* for a specific layer of the map, click *Edit* in the template section.

   These settings will only be available once a set of markers has been added to the component.

## Template Editor UI overview

![Template Editor](~/dataminer/images/Template_Editor.png)<br/>*The Template Editor in DataMiner 10.4.1*

The Template Editor UI consists of the following main components<!--RN 34858-->:

- Side pane:

  - The *Layers* tab (1A)

  - The *Tools* tab (1B)

- Preview (2)

- *Settings* pane (3)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any changes made in the Template Editor are only saved once you click the *Save* button in the lower-right corner. When you close the Template Editor by clicking the "X" in the top-right corner or the *Cancel* button in the lower-right corner, you will be alerted of any unsaved changes that may be lost if you close the editor prematurely.

## Working with layers

In the side pane of the Template Editor, the *Layers* tab offers an overview of all layers. Layers are used to make non-destructive edits by stacking icons, text, HTML content, rectangles, and ellipses one on top of the other without compromising the pixels of individual elements.

The benefits of working with layers:

- You can [add elements](#adding-a-new-layer) on top of each other without removing data.

- You can [apply conditions](#adding-conditional-cases-to-a-layer) to only one layer of the template.

- You can [discard any layers](#deleting-a-layer) you no longer need without affecting the entire template.

- You can [mask layers](#temporarily-masking-a-layer) so that they are temporarily hidden without the need to delete them.

### Adding a new layer

In the *Tools* tab, you can find an overview of available tools, each corresponding to a type of layer that can be added to your template. The following layer types are available:

- Icon

- Text

- HTML (available from DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2]/10.5.5 onwards<!--RN 42519-->)

- Rectangle

- Ellipse

![*Tools* tab](~/dataminer/images/Tools_Tab.png)<br/>*The Template Editor in DataMiner 10.5.5*

To add a new layer:

1. In the *Tools* tab, click the button for the layer type you want to add.

1. In the preview area, press and hold down the left mouse button to draw the layer. Drag to define the size and position, then release the button to place it.

1. Optionally, adjust the size or position of the layer:

   - Drag the frame edges to resize.

   - Click and drag the entire layer to move it.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Alternatively, you can also adjust the size, shape, and position of the layer in the [*Dimensions* section](#resizing-and-positioning-a-layer) of the *Settings* pane.

1. Optionally, configure additional settings for the layer:

   - [Customize the layer's appearance and behavior](#customizing-layer-appearance-and-behavior).

   - [Add conditional cases to the layer](#adding-conditional-cases-to-a-layer).

### Changing the order of layers

If one layer is positioned higher than another, the higher layer will appear in front of the lower one. To change the order of layers, click the ![*Drag-and-drop*](~/dataminer/images/drag-and-drop.png) button and drag the layer up or down in the *Layers* tab. Release the mouse button when you reach the position where you want to place the selected layer.

![Change order layers](~/dataminer/images/Change_Order_Layers.gif)<br/>*Template Editor in DataMiner 10.5.8*

### Temporarily masking a layer

To temporarily mask a layer within the Template Editor, hover the mouse pointer over the layer and click the *eye* icon in the lower-right corner. This action renders the layer invisible while you modify the template. To bring the layer back into view, click the *eye* icon again.

![Temporarily mask layer](~/dataminer/images/Temporarily_Mask_Layer.gif)<br>*Template Editor in DataMiner 10.5.8*

> [!TIP]
> If you want to render a layer invisible in the final result, you can mask the layer by adjusting its properties in the *Settings* pane. See [Customizing layer appearance and behavior](#customizing-layer-appearance-and-behavior).

### Deleting a layer

To delete a layer, hover the mouse pointer over the layer, click the ellipsis button ("...") in the top-right corner, and select *Delete*.

![Delete layer](~/dataminer/images/Delete_Layer.gif)<br>*Template Editor in DataMiner 10.5.8*

Prior to DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2]/10.5.5 onwards<!--RN 42479-->, hover the mouse pointer over the layer and click the *delete* button in the top-right corner.

Alternatively, regardless of the DataMiner version, select the layer in the preview and press *Delete* on your keyboard.

### Duplicating a layer

To duplicate a layer, hover the mouse pointer over the layer, click the ellipsis button ("...") in the top-right corner, and select *Duplicate*. Available from DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2]/10.5.5 onwards<!--RN 42479-->.

![Duplicate layer](~/dataminer/images/Duplicate_Layer.gif)<br>*Template Editor in DataMiner 10.5.8*

## Changing template settings

With the *Settings* pane to the right side of the preview, you can change the settings for the entire template and the different layers. The preview is then immediately updated according to the changes.

- To modify the **template settings**, make sure no layers are selected. In the *Settings* pane, you can specify the width and/or height of the template in pixels.

- To modify the **layer settings**, make sure a layer is selected. In the *Settings* pane, you can adjust the following layer settings in three collapsible sections:

  - [Dimensions](#resizing-and-positioning-a-layer)

  - [Properties](#customizing-layer-appearance-and-behavior)

  - [Conditional cases](#adding-conditional-cases-to-a-layer)

### Resizing and positioning a layer

In the *Dimensions* section of the *Settings* pane, you can resize and position a layer<!--RN 37476-->:

| Icon | Setting | Description |
|--|--|--|
| ![Width](~/dataminer/images/Dimensions_Width.png) | Width | Specify the width of the layer (in pixels or percent). This value should be lower than or equal to the width of the overall template. |
| ![Height](~/dataminer/images/Dimensions_Height.png) | Height | Specify the height of the layer (in pixels or percent). This value should be lower than or equal to the height of the overall template. |
| ![Top](~/dataminer/images/Dimensions_Top.png) | Top | Specify the location of the top of the layer (in pixels or percent). This value should be lower than the height of the overall template. |
| ![Bottom](~/dataminer/images/Dimensions_Bottom.png) | Bottom | Specify the location of the bottom of the layer (in pixels or percent). This value should be lower than the height of the overall template. |
| ![Left](~/dataminer/images/Dimensions_Left.png) | Left | Specify the location of the left edge of the layer (in pixels or percent). This value should be lower than the width of the overall template. |
| ![Right](~/dataminer/images/Dimensions_Right.png) | Right | Specify the location of the right edge of the layer (in pixels or percent). This value should be lower than the width of the overall template. |

To change the unit used for the dimension values, click the unit itself. For instance, clicking *px* will switch to *%*.

You can secure one or multiple dimension settings of a layer by clicking the ![Lock](~/dataminer/images/Dimensions_Lock.png) icon next to the chosen setting. This lock functionality enhances the security of your design, preserving your template's intended appearance, especially when dealing with variable widths and heights. For example, when adjusting a table column width, you may want to maintain specific proportions. Once a setting is locked, any attempt to override the specified dimension will be restricted. This includes moving or resizing the layer in the preview and adjusting the component size in the dashboard or low-code app edit mode (e.g. changing the size of a table column). The locked dimensions ensure that the template remains in its designated position. If you are unable to lock a dimension setting because of the locking of other settings, the lock icon will be grayed out.

From DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU20]/10.5.0 [CU8]/10.5.11 onwards<!-- RN 43740 -->, it is also possible to lock a dimension setting of a shape to the virtual bounds of a component instead of the visual bounds. To do so, keep the CTRL button pressed while clicking the lock icon. The icon will then take the accent color (blue) to indicate that virtual bound locking is enabled. Functionally, this ensures that when virtualization is supported (e.g. in the timeline), shapes will align to the virtual boundary rather than the visible shape boundary, allowing them to extend outside the visible area (i.e. viewport). This way, time-based elements such as pre-roll and post-roll bars that extend beyond the viewport can be visualized.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - In the preview, when you use the drag-and-drop functionality to move a layer, or when you resize a layer by dragging the frame edges, the dimension settings in the *Settings* pane will automatically be adjusted.
> - For some layers, the width and height is determined by the left and right position and can therefore not be modified.
> - Virtual bounds locking of the *Width* dimension is only possible when the unit is set to percent.

### Customizing layer appearance and behavior

Depending on the type of layer, you can specify different layer properties in the *Settings* pane.

Common properties:

| Icon | Property | Description | Layer types |
|--|--|--|
| ![Show layer](~/dataminer/images/Show_Layer-type.png) | Show [layer type] | Toggle the switch to determine whether the layer is visible in the final output. When disabled, the layer is visible (with lowered opacity) in the preview, but not in the end result. | All |

> [!NOTE]
> Certain HTML tags, such as `<iframe>` and `<object>`, are not supported in HTML layers because embedded content is currently restricted in templates. If you want to use these tags, consider using the [web component](xref:DashboardWeb) instead. To display content like video thumbnails in a template, you can convert the content to a base64-encoded image and display it using an `<img>` tag.

### Adding conditional cases to a layer

You can make a layer respond dynamically to certain conditions, such as whether an item is selected or a specific column has a certain value. Conditional cases are defined in the *Conditional cases* section of the *Settings* pane.

Each case includes:

- Conditions: Criteria that determine when the case applies.

- Actions: What happens when the conditions are met (e.g. show or hide the layer, change styling, trigger events).

To configure a conditional case:

1. Click *Add case*.

1. Choose a state or a column from the dropdown list.

   - The available states:

     - *Is selected*: The action will be executed when a user selects the item<!--RN 34761-->.

     - *Is busy*: The action will be executed when the component is busy<!--RN 34859-->.

     - *Hovering*: The action will be executed when a user hovers the mouse pointer over the item<!--RN 34761-->.

   - When you have chosen a state, select *Yes* or *No*.

     - *Yes*: The action is only executed when the element is in the specified state.

     - *No*: The action is only executed when the element is not in the specified state.

   - When you have chosen a column, provide the necessary details based on the column type.

     For example:

     - Element name: The action is only executed when the element name matches this entry.

     - Parameter description: The action is only executed when the parameter description matches this entry.

     - Root time: The action is only executed when the current time aligns with the specified timestamp.

       - `= dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm`: The root time matches the specified timestamp.

       - `> dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm`: The root time occurs after the specified lower bound.

       - `≥ dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm`: The root time occurs at or after the specified lower bound.

       - `< dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm`: The root time occurs before the specified upper bound.

       - `≤ dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm`: The root time occurs at or before the specified upper bound.

1. Optionally, add more conditions by clicking *and condition* and repeating the step above.

1. Use the toggle next to `Show [layer type]` to control the layer's visibility when the conditions are met:

   - Enabled: The layer is shown.

   - Disabled: The layer is hidden.

1. Define how the layer should behave when the conditions are met. You can customize the appearance of the layer or configure on-click actions that can be triggered when the conditions apply.

   - Styling options: Change the appearance of the layer, such as text color, background color, or size. The available options depend on the layer type and are the same as those listed in the [Customizing layer appearance and behavior](#customizing-layer-appearance-and-behavior) section.

   - Event actions: Click the *Events* button to [configure an on-click action](xref:LowCodeApps_event_config) that can be executed when the conditions are met. Only available for DataMiner Low-Code Apps. For *Text* layers, this feature is only available from DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2]/10.5.5 onwards<!--RN 42473-->.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - Any visual changes made when configuring a conditional case will not show up in the preview.
   > - From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.3 onwards<!--RN 38368-->, you can reset visual changes made when configuring a conditional case by clicking the ![reset](~/dataminer/images/Reset_Button.png) button to the right of the option you want to reset. Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.3, you can only reset custom text entered for a *Text* layer.

#### Example

This is a possible conditional case configuration:

![Conditional case](~/dataminer/images/Conditional_Case.png)<br/>*Template Editor in DataMiner 10.4.1*

This is the behavior that will result from this configuration:

## Reusing a template

### [From DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU13]/10.5.0 [CU1]/10.5.4 onwards<!--RN 42226-->](#tab/tabid-1)

If you have already configured at least one other template for a component in the same dashboard or low-code app you are working on, you can reuse it for a second component that supports templates.

- For the **grid and timeline** components:

  1. Select the component and go the *Layout* pane on the right.

  1. Under *Item templates*, click *Browse templates*.

     A list of existing components and their templates is displayed, ordered by component type. A preview shows how the current component would look if the template in question was applied.

  1. Select a template from the list and click *Apply* in the lower-right corner of the pop-up window.

- For the **table** component:

  1. Select the component and go to the *Layout* pane on the right.

  1. In the *Column appearance* section, click the downward arrow next to *Select a column* and select the column you want to assign a template to.

  1. Click the ellipsis button ("...") in the top-right corner and select *Browse templates*.

     A list of existing components and their templates is displayed, ordered by component type. A preview shows how the current component would look if the template in question was applied.

  1. Select a template from the list and click *Apply* in the lower-right corner of the pop-up window.

- For the **maps** component:

  1. Select the component and go to the *Layout* pane on the right.

  1. Under the *Layer settings* for a specific layer of the map, click *Browse templates* in the *Template* section.

     A list of existing components and their templates is displayed, ordered by component type. A preview shows how the current component would look if the template in question was applied.

  1. Select a template from the list and click *Apply* in the lower-right corner of the pop-up window.

### [Earlier DataMiner versions](#tab/tabid-2)

If you have already configured a template for a component of the same type in the same dashboard or low-code app you are working on, you can reuse a template<!--RN 34948-->. Only available for the grid and timeline components.

1. Select the component and go the *Layout* pane on the right.

1. Under *Item templates*, click *Reuse template*.

1. Click *Filter* and select a template from the dropdown list.

   A preview of the template you have selected will appear.

1. Select *Reuse*.

***

Keep in mind that when you reuse templates, you may need to **manually update column references**: In a text layer of a template, you can enter a column name surrounded by curly brackets (e.g. {CustomerName}) to insert the corresponding cell value into your text. However, when you reuse a template, these linked columns will not be automatically updated. If the component you are applying the template to has columns with different column IDs, you will need to manually update the column reference in the template to ensure the correct data is displayed.
