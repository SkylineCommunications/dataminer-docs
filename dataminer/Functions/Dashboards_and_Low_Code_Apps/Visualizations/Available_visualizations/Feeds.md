# Feeds

In versions prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9]/10.4.12<!--RN 41141-->, a separate "feed" component category was used to group the time range, list, tree, parameter picker, EPM picker, query filter, and trigger components. The [Dropdown](xref:DashboardDropdown) visualization was part of this category but, from DataMiner 10.3.5/10.4.0 onwards<!--  RN 35902 -->, it is available under *Basic controls* instead.

Feeds can be added to a dashboard to allow a user to select a DataMiner object for which information can be displayed in other components.

From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9]/10.4.12 onwards, these components are organized under the following categories:

- General: [Time range](xref:DashboardTimeRange), [query filter](xref:DashboardQueryFilter), and [trigger](xref:DashboardTrigger) components.

- Other: [List](xref:DashboardList), [tree](xref:DashboardTree), [parameter picker](xref:DashboardParameterPicker), and [EPM picker](xref:DashboardEPMPicker) components.

> [!NOTE]
> Feeds can be pre-configured in dashboard URLs. See [Specifying data input in a dashboard or app URL](xref:Specifying_data_input_in_a_URL).

> [!TIP]
> Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9]/10.4.12, the term "feeds" is also used for [component data](xref:Component_Data) and [URL data](xref:URL_data).
