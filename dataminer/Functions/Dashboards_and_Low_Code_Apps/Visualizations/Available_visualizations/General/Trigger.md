# Trigger

The trigger component allows you to **manually or automatically refresh other components** in a dashboard or low-code app. It is most often used to refresh the results of a query shown in another component, such as a table or grid component.

![Trigger](~/dataminer/images/Trigger.png)<br>*Trigger component in DataMiner 10.4.6*

With this component, you can:

- Manually [refresh data](#refreshing-data) in another component at the click of a button.

- Automatically refresh data [at regular intervals](#automatically-triggering-updates-with-a-timer), helping you keep your view up to date without interaction.

- [Pause, resume, or reset automatic updates](#letting-users-control-the-trigger-timer), for example to temporarily stop refreshing while analyzing data.

- Visually [track when data was last refreshed](#displaying-when-the-trigger-was-last-activated), thanks to the optional countdown and timestamp.

## Supported components

At present, the trigger component can only be used as a filter for a component displaying a [GQI query](xref:Query_Data) result. It will function as a refresh trigger for that query.

You can for example use this in a low-code app or a dashboard to refresh a [table component](xref:DashboardTable) based on a timer. From DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU12]/10.5.3 onwards<!--RN 41799-->, you can also use this component to refresh a [query filter component](xref:DashboardQueryFilter).

## Refreshing data

To use a trigger component to **refresh the data in another component**:

1. Add a trigger component to your dashboard or app.

1. In the *Data* pane, navigate to *All available data* > *Components* > *Trigger* > *Last trigger* > *Triggers* and drag this component data onto a compatible component (e.g. a table or grid component).

1. Optionally, [enable a trigger timer](#automatically-triggering-updates-with-a-timer) to automatically refresh the data in the linked component at regular intervals.

1. In read mode, either click the trigger button (default: ![Trigger button](~/dataminer/images/Trigger_Button.png)) to manually update the data, or wait for it to refresh automatically based on the configured timer.

## Configuration options

### Trigger layout

In the *Layout* pane, you can find the default options available for all components. See [Customizing the component layout](xref:Customize_Component_Layout).

Additionally, the following layout options are also available:

| Section | Option | Description |
|--|--|--|
| Trigger label | Label | Specify text that should be displayed on the trigger button.|
| Trigger label | Icon | Select which icon will be displayed on the trigger button. You can search for a specific icon using the filter box. Default: ![Trigger button](~/dataminer/images/Trigger_Button.png) |
| Time label | Show when the last trigger happened | Select this option to have the component display when the trigger last went off. Enabled by default. For more information, see [Displaying when the trigger was last activated](#displaying-when-the-trigger-was-last-activated). |
| Time label | Time description format | Only available when *Show when the last trigger happened* is selected. Customize the format used to display when the trigger last went off. For more information, see [Displaying when the trigger was last activated](#displaying-when-the-trigger-was-last-activated). |
| Layout | Align | Determine whether the label and icon are displayed on the left side, in the middle or on the right side of the component. |

#### Displaying when the trigger was last activated

If your dashboard or app includes data that gets refreshed manually or on a timer, it can be helpful for users to **see when the data was last updated**. This provides reassurance that the information is still current and helps users quickly spot if anything might be outdated.

You can show this information directly in the trigger component, so users can always see how recent the data is.

By default, the *Show when the last trigger happened* option is enabled, and the following default text is used:

`was triggered {duration}`

You can customize this text in the *Time description format* box to change how the time is shown when the trigger last activated.

The following placeholders are supported:

| Placeholder | Description |
|--|--|
| {duration} | Shows how long ago the trigger last went off. Example: "2 minutes ago" |
| {time} | Shows the exact time the trigger last went off. Example: "Jun 27, 2025, 12:33" |

Use these placeholders in the text wherever the duration or time should be displayed.

For example:

![Time description format](~/dataminer/images/Time_Description_Format.png)<br>*Trigger layout options in DataMiner 10.5.8*

In the end result:

![Last triggered](~/dataminer/images/Trigger_Last_Triggered.png)<br>*Trigger component in DataMiner 10.5.8*

### Trigger settings

In the *Settings* pane for this component, you can customize its behavior to suit your requirements.

| Section | Option | Description |
|--|--|--|
| WebSocket settings | Inherit WebSocket settings from page/panel | Clear the checkbox to use a custom polling interval for this component. When cleared, you can specify a different polling interval (in seconds). |
| General | Trigger timer | Toggle the switch to determine whether the trigger will automatically go off based on a timer. If this option is enabled, a countdown bar will show when the trigger will go off again. For more information, see [Automatically triggering updates with a timer](#automatically-triggering-updates-with-a-timer). |
| General | Time | Only available when *Trigger Timer* is selected. Determine after how many seconds the data is refreshed. By default, this is set to 60 seconds. |

#### Automatically triggering updates with a timer

If you want to keep the data displayed in your components up to date without manually refreshing it, you can configure a trigger timer that **automatically activates the trigger at regular intervals**.

To set up automatic refresh with a timer:

1. In the *Settings* pane, enable the *Trigger timer* option.

1. Under *Time*, specify the interval in seconds between trigger activations.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The interval must be 5 seconds or higher.

In view mode, a countdown bar will appear in the trigger component, showing when the next refresh is scheduled to occur.

##### Letting users control the trigger timer

From DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU17]/10.5.0 [CU5]/10.5.8 onwards<!--RN 43184-->, you can make the timer interactive by allowing users to manually pause, resume, reset it, or trigger an update immediately. This can be useful, for example, if users want to temporarily stop automatic updates while analyzing data.

![Control the timer](~/dataminer/images/Trigger_Timer_Actions.gif)<br>*Trigger component and button components in DataMiner 10.5.8*

You can do this by configuring component actions in your low-code app using events. These actions can be linked to button components or other UI elements, giving users more control over how and when data is refreshed.

To configure this:

1. Add an event to your app. See [Configuring app events](xref:LowCodeApps_event_config).

1. From the dropdown list, select *Execute component action*.

1. Under *I want to*, choose one of the available options under *Trigger*:

   - *Continue timer*: Resumes the timer if it is currently paused.

   - *Pause timer*: Pauses the timer. If [*Show when the last trigger happened*](#displaying-when-the-trigger-was-last-activated) is enabled, the displayed time continues updating based on the last trigger.

   - *Reset timer*: Resets the timer. The paused or running state of the timer is not affected. If [*Show when the last trigger happened*](#displaying-when-the-trigger-was-last-activated) is enabled, the displayed time is not reset.

   - *Trigger*: Immediately activates the trigger, without resetting or affecting the timer.
