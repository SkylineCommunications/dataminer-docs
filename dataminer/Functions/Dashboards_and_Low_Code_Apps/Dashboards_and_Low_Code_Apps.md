# Dashboards and Low-Code Apps

With the [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D) and [Low-Code Apps](xref:Application_framework) module, you can consolidate any data from your monitored system, so you can access it on any device.

Dashboards and low-code apps can be as simple or complex as you want, using [components](xref:Available_visualizations) that are configured in the same way across both modules. They are particularly useful for selectively [sharing specific data with third parties](xref:Sharing_a_dashboard), without the need to grant access to your entire system.

The main difference between a dashboard and a low-code app is that the latter can combine multiple "dashboards" in one application, with additional functionality: [actions can be triggered based on specific events](xref:LowCodeApps_event_config) (e.g., a user clicks a button, a page is loaded, a panel is closed, etc.), you can [configure panels](xref:LowCodeApps_panel_config) that can for instance be shown as a pop-up window or an overlay, and you can [incorporate menus and submenus into the header bar](xref:LowCodeApps_header_config).
