# Custom operator

Out of the box, GQI offers basic operators for filtering, sorting, aggregating, etc. However, there could be many more operations that you may want to perform on your data. For these scenarios, you can define a custom operator, i.e., an operator that you fully define yourself to extend query functionality. This could for example be for any of the following purposes:

- Adding, removing, and renaming columns
- Transforming data by changing cell values, display values, and metadata
- Filtering out rows based on custom conditions
- Optimizing the behavior of downstream operators

For information about how you can create such a custom operator, refer to [Custom operators](xref:GQI_Custom_Operator).
