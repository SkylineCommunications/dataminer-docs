# GQI DxM

The GQI DxM is a [DataMiner Extension Module (DxM)](xref:DataMinerExtensionModules) that hosts the GQI core engine, enabling efficient data retrieval through [GQI queries](xref:About_GQI).

Running GQI as an extension module has several advantages:

- **Independent updates**: Using a [web-only upgrade package](xref:Upgrading_Downgrading_Webapps), GQI can be updated independently from the main DataMiner core software, eliminating the need for a core software restart during updates.
- **Load balancing**: With the DxM, GQI operations can distribute system load more effectively across multiple DataMiner Agents within a DataMiner System (DMS).
- **Resource visibility**: Running each extension in a separate process provides greater insight into its resource consumption, allowing you to monitor every extension individually.
- **Improved dependency resolving**: Using the DxM simplifies and optimizes the resolution of DLL dependencies, preventing conflicts.
- **Performance enhancements**: The GQI DxM leverages the latest advancements in .NET 8 for improved speed and efficiency, uses proto-first communication, prevents SLNet throttling, etc.

## Installation

The GQI DxM is supported from DataMiner 10.5.0 [CU1]/10.5.4 onwards, and automatically gets installed and updated by upgrade packages from that version onwards. It also gets updated when you install a web-only upgrade package.<!-- RN 41811 --> Earlier DataMiner versions starting from 10.5.0/10.5.2 also include a preview version of the GQI DxM, but this should only be used on staging systems.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, DataMiner web applications will continue to use the SLHelper process for GQI-related operations. To switch to using the GQI DxM, see [Enabling the use of the GQI DxM](#enabling-the-use-of-the-gqi-dxm).

> [!NOTE]
> [Data Aggregator](xref:Data_Aggregator_DxM) supports queries via the GQI DxM from version 3.1.0 onwards. See [Using the GQI DxM for queries](xref:Data_Aggregator_settings#using-the-gqi-dxm-for-queries).

## Enabling the use of the GQI DxM

To enable the use of the GQI DxM in the DataMiner web apps, add the following configuration key to the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Webpages\API\Web.config` file:

```xml
<appSettings>
    <add key="gqi:useDxM" value="true" />
</appSettings>
```

The WebAPI process will automatically restart when you save the file. Once this setting is applied, web applications accessed through the configured server will utilize the GQI DxM. For web applications accessed via other servers, the SLHelper process will continue to be used unless the same configuration is applied to those servers.

From DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU12]/10.5.0/10.5.3 onwards<!--RN 42003-->, to verify that the GQI DxM is enabled for a web app, open the user menu in the top-right corner and select *About*. If the version of the GQI DxM is displayed next to *GQI*, the web app is using the GQI DxM. If `No DxM` is displayed, the web app is still using the SLHelper process.

> If you encounter issues when trying to enable the GQI DxM, refer to [GQI DxM repair](xref:Investigating_Web_Issues#gqi-dxm-repair)

## Configuration

The GQI DxM can be configured via JSON configuration files. The default configuration can be found in `C:\Program Files\Skyline Communications\DataMiner GQI\appsettings.json`. Do **not** use this file to change settings, because it will be overwritten whenever a new version of the GQI DxM is installed.

To change configuration settings, use the configuration file named `appsettings.custom.json` in `C:\Program Files\Skyline Communications\DataMiner GQI\appsettings.json`. If this file does not exist yet, create it in the mentioned location.

Below you can find an overview of the settings that can be configured in this file.

### Logging

See [GQI logging](xref:GQI_Logging) and [GQI extensions logging](xref:GQI_Extensions_Logging).

### Termination of idle child processes

In the *appsettings.custom.json* file, you can specify when idle child processes should be terminated.

See the following example. Idle child processes will be terminated within the configured *WorkerExpiration* time (in this case 1 day) + 30 seconds.

```json
{
  "GQIOptions": {
    "Extensions": {
      "WorkerExpiration": "1.00:00:00"
    }
  }
}
```

### Message handler configuration

The `MessageHandler` manages requests from clients to the GQI DxM. Requests are placed in a queue, and a specified number of requests can be processed concurrently.

You can configure the following options in the `MessageHandlerOptions` in the *appsettings.custom.json* file:

- **RequestTimeout**: Maximum time a request can take before timing out (default: 15 minutes). This includes the time in the queue.
- **MaxConcurrentRequests**: Maximum number of requests that can be processed at the same time (default: 100). Note that prior to DataMiner 10.5.0 [CU8]/10.5.11<!-- RN 43730 -->, a lower default number of 20 is applied.
- **MaxPendingRequests**: Maximum number of requests allowed in the queue (default: 1000).

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "MessageHandlerOptions": {
    "RequestTimeout": "00:15:00",
    "MaxConcurrentRequests": 100,
    "MaxPendingRequests": 1000
  }
}
```
