## Step 1: Create an app

The DataMiner Low-Code Apps are available on the DataMiner landing page. To access this page, browse to the IP or hostname of a DMA or to `https://[Your DMA]/root`, depending on your configuration.

1. Hover over a section below the DataMiner apps section until you see the "+" icon, and then click that icon to start creating a new app.

   A preliminary version of a new application, also known as a draft, will be generated. Drafts serve as temporary iterations that aid in the development of an app. Once the necessary adjustments and modifications have been made, you can release a draft for public use.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If no other apps have been created yet, you can click the *Create a new app* option instead.

1. To modify the appearance of your app, click the icon in the top-left corner.

1. Change the color of your app to one of the following possibilities:

   - *Hex* "#2c746c"
   - *RGB* "rgb(44,116,108)"

1. Click the icon in the top left-corner again to return to your app.

## Step 2: Publish the app

Your app is currently in the "Draft" stage, but you can now take it live by publishing it. This will make it visible to everyone with the rights to access DataMiner Low-Code Apps.

1. Click the leftmost icon in the top-right corner.

1. Provide a short description for your app, "Something about IPs", and confirm by clicking *Publish*.

   You will be redirected to the live version of your app.

1. Go take a look at your app on the DataMiner landing page.
