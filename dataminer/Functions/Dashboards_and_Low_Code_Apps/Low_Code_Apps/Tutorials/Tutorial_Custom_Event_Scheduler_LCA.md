## Step 1: Install the example package from the catalog

1. Go to <https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/a7776ac5-dfef-4242-ace0-fac33c1834d4>.

1. Click the *Deploy* button to deploy the package to your DMA

   This package contains the final solution that you can use as a guideline, as well as the necessary DOM models, and it will create some sample events to work with upon installation.

## Step 2: Create the app and the pages

1. Go to `http(s)://[DMA name]/root`.

   In the *Event Planning* section, you should see the **Sport event manager** application.

   > [!TIP]
   > In this tutorial, you will mainly learn about the functional aspects of an event scheduler app. If you want to experiment with the layout and with custom templates as well, you can use the *Sport event manager* app as an example.

1. Hover over the section name and click the "+" icon to create a new app.

   ![Add app icon](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_Add_app.png)

1. Specify a name for the new app.

1. Rename the first page of the app to `Event table`.

1. In the pane to the right of the navigation pane, select an icon of your choosing for the page.

1. Click the *Create page* button under your current page to add a new page.

1. Name this new page `Timeline` and select a suitable icon for it.

   For example:

   ![app pages](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_events_app_pages.png)

These are the only pages that you will need for this tutorial.

## Step 3: Create the GQI queries

In this step, you will create two queries: a full events query and a table events query.

### Full events query

1. On either of the pages of your app, in the *Data* pane on the right, expand the *Queries* section and click "+" to add a new GQI query.

1. In the *Name* box for your query, add the name `Full Events`.

1. Select the data source *Get object manager instances*, and configure it as follows:

   - Module: *sporteventmanagement*
   - Object manager definition: *Event*

1. Add a *Select* operator, keep the selection for all columns that are selected by default for the operator, and select the column *ID* as well.

1. Add an *Apply custom operator* operator, and select the operator *Date comparer*.

1. Configure the operator as follows:

   - Start: *Start Time*
   - End: *End Time*

   This  will add a new column called *Compared Times* to the result of your query, indicating if the event is "Ongoing" or "Future".

The complete query should look like this:

![Full events query](~/dataminer/images/Full_events_query.png)

### Table events query

1. In the same way as before, create a GQI query called `Table Events`.

1. Select the data source *Start From* and make sure the previously created query is selected.

1. Add a *Select* operator to only include the following columns in the query:

   - Event Name
   - Priority
   - Type
   - Start Time
   - End Time
   - Tags

The complete query should look like this:

![Table events query](~/dataminer/images/Table_events_query.png)

## Step 4: Configure the event overview page

1. Go to the *Event table* page of your app.

1. Add a title component:

   1. Drag a [web component](xref:DashboardWeb) from the visualizations pane on the left onto the page and position it in the top-left corner.

      ![Web component](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_events_app_add_web_component.png)

   1. Make sure the component is selected and select the *Settings* pane on the right.

   1. Make sure *Type* is set to *Custom HTML* and paste the following custom HTML in the *HTML* box:

      ```html
      <div>
         <h1>Sport <span data-y>Event</span> Manager</h1>
      </div>
      <style>
      div {
         font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;
         line-height: .6;
         font-size: 16px;
         color: 464646;
         display: flex;
         align-items: end;
         height: 100%
      }

      p {
         margin: 0
      }

      [data-b] {
         color: rgb(0, 191, 239)
      }

      [data-y] {
         color: rgb(255, 179, 0)
      }

      [data-p] {
         color: rgb(255, 0, 107)
      }

      </style>
      ```

   1. Go to the *Layout* pane, and enable the *Customize* toggle button.

   1. At the top of the *Styles* section, click *Custom theme*, and select *Transparent*.

1. Add a query filter component:

   1. Drag a [query filter component](xref:DashboardQueryFilter) onto the page so that it is located on the left side under the title.

   1. Drag the *Table events* query onto the component to provide it with data.

   1. Expand the *Table events* query in the *Data* pane, and drag each of the columns in the query, except for the *Priority* column, to the query filter component as a filter.

      ![Add columns as a filter](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_events_app_add_columns_as_filter.png)

1. Add a table component:

   1. Drag a regular [table component](xref:DashboardTable) onto the page next to the query filter component.

   1. In the *Data* pane, expand the *Components* section, and drag the *Query filter* component entry onto your table component to provide it with data based on the selection in the query filter component.

## Step 5: Enable users to add events

In this step, you will make sure the user can create new events by clicking a button on the page. For this, you will first need to create a button and configure it to open a new panel when it is clicked. This panel will contain a form that the user can use to create new events, together with a button that will allow the user to save the event.

1. Drag a [button component](xref:DashboardButton) to the top of the *Event table* page of your app.

1. Make sure the new component is selected, go to *Layout* pane on the right, and configure the layout as follows:

   - Change the label to `Add event`.
   - Customize the icon according to your preferences.

1. In the *Panels* section on the left, create a new panel called `New event`.

   ![Create a new panel](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_events_app_new_event_panel.png)

   > [!TIP]
   > For more information on panels, see [Configuring an app panel](xref:LowCodeApps_panel_config).

1. Click the pencil icon next to the panel name to begin editing the panel.

1. Drag a [form component](xref:DashboardForm) onto the panel.

1. In the *Data* pane, expand *Object Manager Definitions* > *eventmanagement*, and drag the *Event* definition onto the form component.

1. Make sure the header bar is enabled for the panel, and click the "+" button in the header bar to add a button called `Save`.

   ![Add a "Save" button](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_events_app_add_save_button.png)

   > [!TIP]
   > For more information on the header bar, see [Using a header bar](xref:Tutorial_Apps_Headerbar).

1. In the *Events* section for the *Save* button, click *Configure actions*.

1. Configure the following consecutive actions that will run when the button is clicked:

   1. Select *Execute component action* and *Save current changes*.

   1. Click *+ Upon completion* to add the next action, select *Show a notification*, and configure the notification so it indicates that the event has been saved.

   1. Click *+ Upon completion*, and select *Close a panel*.

   1. Click *+ Upon completion*, select *Execute component action*, and select *Fetch the data* for the table component.

   1. Click *+ Upon completion*, select *Execute component action*, and select *Select an item* for the table component.

   1. Click *OK* to save your changes.

   ![Actions configured on the "Save" button](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_events_app_save_button_actions.png)

1. Click the arrow icon in the top-left corner to go back to the *Event table* page.

1. Select the *Add event* button that you added to the page earlier and go to the *Settings* pane on the right.

1. Click *Configure actions*.

1. Select the action *Open a panel*, and configure it so that the *New event* panel is opened when the button is clicked.

## Step 6: Enable users to edit events

In this step, you will add another panel that will open when an event in the table is double-clicked. This new panel will show an overview of the selected event and enable the user to save changes or delete the event.

1. Select an event in the table.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Make sure not to skip this step. If no event is selected in the table, you will not be able to correctly link the selected event with the form component in the panel.

1. Create a new panel called `Event form`.

1. Add a [form component](xref:DashboardForm) to the panel.

1. In the *Data* pane on the right, expand *Components* > *Event table* > *Table X* (e.g. *Table 3*) > *Selected rows*, and drag *Object manager instances* onto the form.

   In the form, you should now see the details of the event you have selected.

1. Add a button named `Save` in the header bar for the panel.

1. In the *Events* section for the *Save* button, click *Configure actions*.

1. Configure the following consecutive actions for the button, using the *+ Upon completion* button to add each consecutive action like before:

   1. A component action *Save current changes* on the form component on the *Event form* panel.

   1. A *Show a notification* action with a message indicating that the changes have been saved.

   1. A *Close a panel* action to close this panel.

   1. A component action *Fetch the data* for the table component.

   ![Actions configured on the "Save" button](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_events_app_save_button_actions_2.png)

1. Add a button named `Delete` in the header bar.

1. In the *Events* section for the *Delete* button, click *Configure actions*.

1. Configure the following consecutive actions for the button, using the *+ Upon completion* button to add each consecutive action like before:

   1. A component action *Delete instance* on the form component.

   1. A *Close a panel* action to close this panel.

   1. A component action *Fetch the data* for the table component.

   ![Actions configured on the "Delete" button](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_events_app_delete_button_actions.png)

1. Click the arrow icon in the top-left corner to go back to the *Event table* page.

1. Select the table component and go to the *Settings* pane on the right.

1. Under *Actions*, next to *On double-click*, click *Configure actions*.

1. Select the action *Open a panel*, and configure it so that the *Event form* panel is opened when the table is double-clicked.

   ![Actions configured on double-click](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_events_app_double_click_actions.png)

## Step 7: Configure the timeline overview page

In this step, you will add a title, a time range component, and a timeline component, and then link the latter two components to one another so that the timeline updates its viewport when a time range is selected, and that the time range selection updates automatically when a user pans in the timeline.

1. Add a title component:

   1. Drag a [web component](xref:DashboardWeb) onto the page and and position it in the top-left corner.

   1. Make sure the component is selected and select the *Settings* pane on the right.

   1. Make sure *Type* is set to *Custom HTML* and paste the following custom HTML in the *HTML* box:

      ```html
      <div>
      <h1>Timeline</h1>
      </div>
      <style>
      div {
         font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;
         line-height: .6;
         font-size: 16px;
         color: 464646;
         display: flex;
         align-items: end;
         height: 100%
      }

      p {
         margin: 0
      }

      [data-b] {
         color: rgb(0, 191, 239)
      }

      [data-y] {
         color: rgb(255, 179, 0)
      }

      [data-p] {
         color: rgb(255, 0, 107)
      }
      </style>
      ```

1. Add a time range component:

   1. Drag a [time range component](xref:DashboardTimeRange) onto the page so that it is located to the right of the title.

   1. Make sure the component is selected and select the *Settings* pane on the right.

   1. In the *Default range* box, select *Last and next 12 hours*.

   1. Go to the *Layout* pane, expand the *Presets* section, and clear all checkboxes to disable all presets.

   1. Select *Use quick picks*, and select the quick pick buttons you want to add to the component.

1. Add a timeline component:

   1. Drag a [timeline component](xref:DashboardTimeline) onto the page so that it is located underneath the title and the time range component.

   1. From the *Data* pane, drag the previously created query *Full events* onto the timeline component.

   1. Expand the *Full events* query in the *Data* pane, and drag the *Type* column to the blue grouping icon that will appear on top of the timeline component.

      ![Group the timeline based on type](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_events_app_group_on_type.png)

      This will group the events on the timeline based on their type.

   1. In the *Settings* pane, set *Default time range* to *Last and next 12 hours*, so that it is the same as for the time range component.

1. Link the time range to the timeline and vice versa:

   1. Make sure the timeline component is selected, go to the *Settings* pane, and click the icon next to *Link time range*.

   1. In the *Link to* box, select the time range component, and click *Link*.

   1. In the *Data* pane, expand *Components* > *Timeline X* (e.g. *Timeline 3*) > *Viewport*, and drag the *Timespans* item below this onto the time range component

## Step 8: Configure actions on the timeline

In this step, you will further configure the timeline so that users will be able to drag and drop events and to change the start and end time of an event by dragging its edges.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure an event is selected in the timeline before you continue. Otherwise, you will not be able to select the event for the actions.

1. Select the timeline component and go to the *Settings* pane.

1. Next to *On item resize*, click *Configure actions*, and configure the actions as follows:

   1. Select *Launch a script* to add a script action.

   1. Select the *Event manager - Update event* script.

   1. Expand the *Parameters* section, and click the link icon next to the *Event ID* box.

   1. Link to *Event info*, with the type *Current item/Tables*, and the property *ID*.

      ![Link "Event ID" to the ID property](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_events_link_to_event_info.png)

   1. Click the link icon for the *From* parameter, and link it to *Event info*, with the type *New/Timespans*, and the property *From*.

   1. Click the link icon for the *Until* parameter, and link it to *Event info*, with the type *New/Timespans*, and the property *To*.

   1. Click *+ Upon completion*.

   1. Add a component action *Fetch the data* on the timeline, and click *OK*.

1. Back in the *Settings* pane, next to *On item move*, click *Configure actions*, and add the same actions as for *On item resize*.
