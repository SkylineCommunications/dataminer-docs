# Deleting an app

You can delete a low-code app from within the app or from the DataMiner landing page.

From the DataMiner **landing page** (supported from DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU10]/10.4.0 onwards<!-- RN 37830 -->):

1. Click the ellipsis ("...") button next to the app and select *Delete*.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Prior to DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU18]/10.5.0 [CU6]/10.5.9<!--RN 43226-->, the ellipsis button only appears when you hover over the app icon.

1. Click *Confirm*.

From **within an application**:

- From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6]/10.4.9 onwards<!--RN 40077-->:

  1. Click the pencil icon in the top-right corner.

  1. Click the ellipsis button ("...") in the top-right corner and select *Delete app*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To delete the current draft version of the app instead, select *Discard draft*.

  1. In the pop-up window, click *Delete*.

- From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU11]/10.4.2 onwards<!--RN 37878-->:

  1. Click the user icon in the top-right corner and select *Edit*.

  1. Click the user icon in the top-right corner and select *Delete app*.

  1. In the pop-up window, click *Delete*.

  > [!NOTE]
  > To delete the current draft version of the app instead, click the ![Delete draft](~/dataminer/images/Delete_Draft.png) icon next to the user icon. This draft version gets created as soon as you click *Edit*, so selecting this option will never remove a previously saved version.

- Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU11]/10.4.2:

  1. Click the user icon in the top-right corner and select *Edit*.

  1. Click the garbage can icon next to the user icon.

  1. In the pop-up window, select to delete the entire application, and click *Delete*.

     You can also select to delete the current draft version of the app instead. This draft version gets created as soon as you click *Edit*, so selecting this option will never remove a previously saved version.
