# Configuring an app panel

In addition to pages, panels can be configured in apps in the Low-Code Apps module. These contain secondary content that can be shown on top of pages. Panels can be shown or hidden via actions, for example when a user clicks a button. They can also be reused on multiple different pages.

1. While you are editing a page, in the page configuration pane, open the *panels* section.

1. To add a new panel, click the "+" button in this section, and then specify a name for your panel.

   Note that from DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU13]/10.5.0 [CU1]/10.5.4 onwards<!--RN 42220-->, panel names are limited to 150 characters.

1. To configure a panel, click the pencil icon next to the panel. This will open the panel configuration pane.

1. To configure a header bar for the panel, follow the same steps as to configure this for a page. See [Configuring the app header bar](xref:LowCodeApps_header_config).

1. To configure general panel settings, see [Configuring the settings for a page of panel](xref:Changing_low-code_app_settings#configuring-the-settings-for-a-page-of-panel).

1. From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4]/10.4.7 onwards<!--RN 39668 + 39636-->, if one or more actions should be triggered when the panel is opened or closed, in the panel configuration pane, open the *Events* section and click the *Configure actions* button next to *On open* or *On close*. Then configure the action(s) that should be triggered. See [Configuring app events](xref:LowCodeApps_event_config).

1. Click the pencil icon to configure the components on the panel. See [Configuring components](xref:Configuring_components) and [Changing dashboard settings](xref:Changing_dashboard_settings). For a list of the available components, refer to [Available visualizations](xref:Available_visualizations).

## Opening a panel

To allow users to open a panel, you will need to configure an event with the action [Open a panel](xref:LowCodeApps_event_config#opening-a-panel-of-the-app).

From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4]/10.4.7 onwards<!--RN 39632-->, an opened panel will by default remain open when you navigate to a different page using the sidebar. However, if a [*Close a panel*](xref:LowCodeApps_event_config#closing-a-panel-of-the-app) or [*Close all panels*](xref:LowCodeApps_event_config#closing-all-panels-of-the-app) action is configured for an *On open* or *On close* page event, the panel will close.

> [!NOTE]
> To ensure older apps function correctly after upgrading to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU16]/ 10.4.0 [CU4]/10.4.7 or higher, an *On close* page event with a [*Close all panels*](xref:LowCodeApps_event_config#closing-all-panels-of-the-app) action is automatically configured for each page of apps created before the upgrade<!--RN 39632-->. As a result, these older apps will continue to show the same behavior as before the upgrade: panels will close when you navigate to another page in the sidebar. New pages and new apps added after the upgrade will not have these events configured.

## Closing a panel

Users can close a panel in different ways:

- If the panel is opened as an overlay (i.e. the background is slightly blurred), clicking outside the panel will close it.

- Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4]/10.4.7<!--RN 39632-->), a panel is closed when you navigate to a different page using the sidebar.

- By means of an event that triggers one of the following actions:

  - A [*Close a panel*](xref:LowCodeApps_event_config#closing-a-panel-of-the-app) action.

  - A [*Close all panels*](xref:LowCodeApps_event_config#closing-all-panels-of-the-app) action (available from DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4]/10.4.7 onwards<!--RN 39625-->).

## Deleting a panel

From DataMiner 10.3.6/10.4.0 onwards, to delete a panel, click the ellipsis button next to the panel name in the page configuration pane, and select *Delete*.<!-- RN 36097 --> Prior to DataMiner 10.3.6/10.4.0, to delete a panel, click the garbage can icon next to the panel name in the page configuration pane, and then click the confirmation icon.

## Duplicating a panel

From DataMiner 10.3.6/10.4.0 onwards, to duplicate a panel, click the ellipsis button next to the panel name in the page configuration pane, and select *Duplicate*. <!-- RN 36097 -->
