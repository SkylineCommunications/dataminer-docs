# Configuring the app header bar

When you are configuring an app in the Low-Code Apps module, you can configure the header bar for each page and panel. Such a header bar consists of different buttons, which can be used to execute actions or show a drop-down menu with additional buttons.

To configure a header bar:

1. Click the *header bar* toggle button.

1. Click the "+" icon on the left or right side of the page header bar, depending on where you want to add a button to the header bar.

1. Enter a name for the button in the page configuration pane or directly on the button in the header bar.

1. In the page configuration pane, expand the *Icon* section to select an icon for the button.

1. If you want the button to be a drop-down box, click the ![Set as drop-down](~/dataminer/images/AppSetAsDropdown.png) icon.

1. To configure what will happen when a user clicks the button:

   1. Expand the *Events* section for the header bar in the page configuration pane, and click the configuration button to the right of *On click*.

   1. Select and configure the action(s) that should be triggered when the button is clicked. See [Configuring app events](xref:LowCodeApps_event_config).

1. Add and configure additional buttons if needed.

> [!NOTE]
> To delete a button, click the garbage can icon next to that button in the page configuration pane, and then click the check mark icon to confirm.
