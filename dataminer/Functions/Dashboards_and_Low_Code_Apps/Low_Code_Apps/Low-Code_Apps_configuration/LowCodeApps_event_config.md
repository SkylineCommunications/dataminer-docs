# Configuring app events

You can configure actions for different types of events in DataMiner Low-Code Apps. These are the main types:

- *On open*: This event takes place when an app, a page, or a panel is opened. See [Changing app settings](xref:Changing_low-code_app_settings), [Configuring an app page](xref:LowCodeApps_page_config), or [Configuring an app panel](xref:LowCodeApps_panel_config).

  > [!NOTE]
  > Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4]/10.4.7<!--RN 39604 + 39682 + 39636-->, this type of event is only available for low-code app pages and is called "On page load".
  > Prior to DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU12]/10.5.3<!--RN 42039-->, this type of event only executes its actions when all components are done loading. This also includes the components that need scrolling down to be loaded.

- *On click*: This event takes place when a user clicks a button. (See [Configuring the app header bar](xref:LowCodeApps_header_config).)

- *On close*: Available from DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4]/10.4.7 onwards<!--RN 39604 + 39682 + 39668-->. This event takes place when a page or panel is closed.

  - A page can be closed either by manually navigating away using the sidebar or via an action.

  - A panel can be closed by clicking outside of it (if it was opened as an overlay), or when a [*Close a panel*](xref:LowCodeApps_event_config#closing-a-panel-of-the-app) or [*Close all panels*](xref:LowCodeApps_event_config#closing-all-panels-of-the-app) action is executed.

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > - Navigating to the next page is blocked until all configured actions are executed.
  > - A panel will close only after all configured actions are executed.
  > - Actions linked to an *On close* page or panel event will not be executed when you close the app.

Other types are possible depending on the component and the DataMiner version. For each of these events, you can configure actions as detailed below.

> [!TIP]
> Actions can be combined and chained to create more complex behavior. For example, an *Open a page* action can be followed by an *Open a panel* action to open a panel on a specific page. While the panel is being opened, a *Launch a script* action can execute an Automation script that updates parameters that will be displayed on that panel. All of this can be triggered from a header bar button, for example on the initial page.
>
> See also: [Tutorials — Running a script when a page opens](xref:Tutorial_Apps_Script_Upon_Page_Load) and [Tutorials — Chaining actions](xref:Tutorial_Apps_Chaining_Actions).

## Launching a script

To configure an event to launch a script:

1. Select *Launch a script* and select the script.

1. If the script requires input such as dummies and parameters, configure these as well.

   When applicable, you can link a parameter to existing data. To do so, you can use the link icon (from DataMiner 10.3.5/10.4.0 onwards<!--  RN 35837 -->), or the *Use feed* checkbox (in earlier DataMiner versions).

1. Optionally, click the *Show settings* button to configure [script execution options](xref:Script_execution_options).

> [!NOTE]
> Data can often contain multiple values, and therefore the values will be wrapped in a JSON array. To be consistent, this will also be the case when only a single value is provided.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU14]/10.4.0 [CU2]/10.4.5 onwards<!-- RN 39027 -->, linking a script parameter to empty data (or to an empty feed, prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9]/10.4.12<!--RN 41141-->) will fill it with an empty array. The dialog to manually enter a parameter will no longer be shown when the action is launched. This change can break existing implementations when it is not handled by the script.

From DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU18]/10.5.0 [CU6]/10.5.9 onwards<!--RN 43222-->, the output of an Automation script can be used in the post actions of a *Launch a script* action. See [Configuring another action for the same event](#configuring-another-action-for-the-same-event).

To use this output as data:

1. If available, click the link icon in the action configuration.

1. Navigate to the *Action* tab.

1. Set *Type* to `Script outputs`.

1. Enter the desired property name.

1. Select *Link*.

> [!NOTE]
> If a referenced key does not exist in the output, an empty string is returned by default.

## Navigating to a URL

To configure an event to navigate to a URL:

1. Select *Navigate to a URL* and specify the URL.

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > - You can link the URL to data using the [appropriate syntax](xref:Dynamically_Referencing_Data_in_Text#syntax).
   > - In the Template Editor (available from DataMiner 10.4.1/10.5.0 onwards), you can create dynamic links or pass context to a script by incorporating variables within the URL, denoted by enclosing the column name within curly brackets ("`{}`")<!--RN 34761-->. See [Dynamically referencing data in text](xref:Dynamically_Referencing_Data_in_Text).

1. Optionally, to open the webpage in a new tab, enable the option *Open in new tab*.

## Copying text to the clipboard

Available from DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU11]/10.5.2 onwards<!--RN 41729-->.

To configure an event to copy text to the clipboard:

1. Select *Copy to clipboard*.

1. In the text box, enter the content to be copied when the event is triggered. Alternatively, use curly brackets to insert variables dynamically.

In the following example, an on-click *Copy to clipboard* action was configured for an icon added to a table column:

![Copy to clipboard](~/dataminer/images/Copy_to_Clipboard.png)<br>*Copy to clipboard action configuration in DataMiner 10.5.2*

When the icon is clicked, the content of the associated "Order ID" cell is copied to the clipboard.

Optionally, you can configure a [*Show a notification* action](#showing-a-notification) to run after the *Copy to clipboard* action. This notification confirms that the content was successfully copied to the clipboard:

![Copy to clipboard](~/dataminer/images/Copy_to_Clipboard.gif)<br>*Low-Code Apps module in DataMiner 10.5.2*

## Opening a page of the app

To configure an event to open another page of the app:

- Select *Open a page* and select the page.

## Opening a panel of the app

To configure an event to open a panel of the app:

1. select *Open a panel* and select the panel.

1. In the *Where* box, select where the panel should be opened: in a pop-up window, on the left, or on the right.

1. In the *Width* box, specify the width of the panel (in %) compared to the rest of the app.

1. Specify how the panel should be opened:

   - From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4]/10.4.7 onwards<!--RN 39649-->, you can select one of the following options:

     - *Basic*: The panel opens on top of the page.

     - *As overlay*: If a panel is opened as an overlay, the background for the panel is slightly blurred, and the panel is automatically hidden as soon as the user clicks outside of it. This is the default setting.

     - *Draggable*: This option is only available when *Where* is set to open the panel in a pop-up window. When the panel is draggable, you can move the panel by left-clicking and dragging the header of the panel to its destination.

   - Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4]/10.4.7, to set the panel to open as an overlay, toggle the *As overlay* button.

## Closing a panel of the app

To configure an event to close a panel of the app:

1. Select *Close a panel* and select the panel.

1. In the *Where* box, select where the panel that should be closed is located: in a pop-up window, on the left, or on the right. This is necessary in case the same panel is opened multiple times in different places.

## Closing all panels of the app

Available from DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU16]/ 10.4.0 [CU4]/10.4.7 onwards<!--RN 39625-->.

To configure an event to close all panels of the app:

- Select *Close all panels*.

> [!NOTE]
> Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU16]/ 10.4.0 [CU4]/10.4.7, navigating to a different low-code app page would close any open panels. From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU16]/ 10.4.0 [CU4]/10.4.7 onwards, panels remain open when you navigate to a different page. To ensure older apps function correctly after upgrading to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU16]/ 10.4.0 [CU4]/10.4.7 or higher, an *On close* page event with a *Close all panels* action is automatically configured for each page of apps created before the upgrade<!--RN 39632-->. New pages and new apps added after the upgrade will not have these events configured.

## Opening an app

To configure an event to open another low-code app that has been published in your DMS:

- Select *Open an app* and select the app.

  > [!NOTE]
  > *Drafts* apps are included in the list of apps you can select.

## Executing a component action

This option is only displayed if there is a component action that can be executed.

To configure an event to execute a component action:

1. Select *Execute component action* and specify which action should be executed.

> [!NOTE]
> Actions applied to components will exclusively take effect on components that are currently visible. Any action attempted on an invisible component will be disregarded, along with any subsequent actions related to it.

Examples:

- If you configure this action for a [Table](xref:DashboardTable) component, you can select the options *Clear selection*, *Fetch the data*, or *Select an item*. Or from DataMiner 10.2.10/10.3.0 onwards, you can select *Fetch the data* for any component that uses query data as input, so that users can manually refresh the displayed data.

- If you add a line chart component and a button component, you can configure this action on the button and select the option *Set viewport*<!-- RN 39254 -->, so that users can use the button to set the viewport for the line chart. The action has two arguments, *To* and *From*, which can be either set to a static value or linked to numeric value data. Available from DataMiner 10.3.5/10.4.0 onwards. Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU14]/10.4.0 [CU2]/10.4.5, this option is named *Set timespan*<!-- RN 35933 -->.

- From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU4]/10.4.0 [CU2]/10.4.5 onwards<!--RN 38974-->, if you configure this action for a [Node edge graph](xref:DashboardNodeEdgeGraph) component, you can select the option *Clear selection*.

- From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU18]/10.4.0 [CU6]/10.4.9 onwards<!--RN 40252-->, if you add a [numeric input](xref:DashboardNumericInput), [text input](xref:DashboardTextInput), or [search input](xref:DashboardSearchInput) component, you can configure this action on, for example, a button and select the option *Set value*, so that users can use the button to set the current value of the component, which can either be set to a static value or linked to data.

  ![Set value](~/dataminer/images/Set_Value.gif)<br>*Grid, text input, and table components in DataMiner 10.4.9*

- From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU20]/10.4.0 [CU8]/10.4.11 onwards<!--RN 40569-->, if you add a [time range component](xref:DashboardTimeRange), you can configure this action on, for example, a button and select the option *Set value*, so that users can use the button to set the current value of the component, which can either be set to a preset or custom time range.

## Changing a variable

Available from DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU10]/10.5.1 onwards<!--RN 41324 + 41253-->. This option is only displayed if at least one [variable](xref:Variables) is configured in the low-code app.

To configure an event to change a variable:

1. Select *Change variable*.

1. In the *Variable* box, select the variable you want to modify.

1. Depending on the type of variable, specify the action to be performed when the event is triggered:

   - *Set [variable type]*<!--RN 41253-->: Set the value of the variable. Depending on the variable type, you can:

     - Enter a static value.

     - Select a value from the dropdown list.

     - Link the value to dynamic data in the app using the ![Link to data](~/dataminer/images/Link_to_Data.png) icon.

     > [!NOTE]
     > For table variables, you can only set a static value. The columns in the table are locked to the default values specified during the variable setup.

   - *Update* > *Add row*<!--RN 41324-->: Add a new row to a table variable. Enter the data for each column in the row or link the values to dynamic data in the app using the ![Link to data](~/dataminer/images/Link_to_Data.png) icons.

   - *Update* > *Clear table*<!--RN 41324-->: Remove all rows from a table variable.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - You can only click the *Apply* button to confirm a link to dynamic data when a valid link has been configured<!--RN 41251-->.
   > - A value linked to dynamic data can be identified by the ![Unlink](~/dataminer/images/Unlink.png) icon. To unlink dynamic data, click this icon and select *Unlink*<!--RN 41251-->.

1. Optionally, add more actions for the variable if needed.
