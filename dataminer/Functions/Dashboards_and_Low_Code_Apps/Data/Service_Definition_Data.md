# Service definition data

The *Service definitions* data category allows you to use data from [service definitions](xref:srm_definitions#service-definition) in your DataMiner System as input for components in your dashboards or low-code apps.

When you expand the *Service definitions* section in the *Data* pane, a list of all available service definitions is displayed. To quickly find a specific service definition, use the filter box at the top of the data section.
