# Spectrum preset data

The *Spectrum presets* data category allows you to use data from [spectrum presets](xref:Using_Spectrum_Analysis_presets) in your DataMiner System as input for components in your dashboards or low-code apps.

When you expand the *Spectrum presets* section in the *Data* pane, you first need to select a Spectrum Analyzer protocol. When this is done, all available spectrum presets are listed. To quickly find a specific spectrum preset, use the filter box at the top of the data section.

> [!NOTE]
> Spectrum preset data can also be used as a filter in the [spectrum analyzer component](xref:DashboardSpectrumAnalyzer).
