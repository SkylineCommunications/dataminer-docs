# Spectrum buffer data

The *Spectrum buffers* data category allows you to use data from [spectrum buffers](xref:Working_with_spectrum_monitors#watching-spectrum-buffers) in your DataMiner System as input for components in your dashboards or low-code apps.

When you expand the *Spectrum buffers* section in the *Data* pane, you first need to select a Spectrum Analyzer element. When this is done, all available spectrum buffers are listed. To quickly find a specific spectrum buffer, use the filter box at the top of the data section.

A common use case is to drag the entire *Spectrum buffers* dataset onto a component as data input and then apply an [*Element* filter](xref:Element_Data). This allows you to display all buffers that belong to a particular element.
