# Protocol data

The *Protocols* data category allows you to use data from [protocols](xref:Protocols1) in your DataMiner System as input for components in your dashboards or low-code apps.

When you expand the *Protocols* section in the *Data* pane, a list of all available protocols is displayed. To quickly find a specific protocol, use the filter box at the top of the data section.

To use all protocols in your DataMiner System as data input, select the *Protocols* header and drag it onto a compatible visualization.

Protocol data can also be used as a filter. For example, if you have a component that uses the entire *Elements* dataset as input, you can drag a protocol data item onto it to show only the elements that use that specific protocol.
