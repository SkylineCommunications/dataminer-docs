# Object manager definition data

The *Object manager definitions* data category allows you to use data from [DOM definitions](xref:DomDefinition) in your DataMiner System as input for components in your dashboards or low-code apps.

When you expand the *Object manager definitions* section in the *Data* pane, the available items are shown in a tree-like structure. Each module appears as a top-level item, with its corresponding DOM definitions listed underneath it.

To quickly find a specific DOM definition, use the filter box at the top of the data section.

Object manager definition data are often used as a filter. For example, if you have a component that uses the entire [*Object manager instances* dataset](xref:Object_Manager_Instance_Data) as input, you can drag an object manager definition data item onto it to show only the DOM instances that belong to a particular definition.
