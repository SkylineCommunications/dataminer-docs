# Service data

The *Services* data category allows you to use data from [services](xref:About_services#services) in your DataMiner System as input for components in your dashboards or low-code apps.

When you expand the *Services* section in the *Data* pane, a list of all available services is displayed. To quickly find a specific service, use the filter box at the top of the data section.

To use all services in your DataMiner System as data input, select the *Services* header and drag it onto a compatible visualization.
