# Redundancy group data

The *Redundancy groups* data category allows you to use data from [redundancy groups](xref:RedundancyGroups) in your DataMiner System as input for components in your dashboards or low-code apps.

When you expand the *Redundancy groups* section in the *Data* pane, a list of all available redundancy groups is displayed. To quickly find a specific redundancy group, use the filter box at the top of the data section.

To use all redundancy groups in your DataMiner System as data input, select the *Redundancy groups* header and drag it onto a compatible visualization.
