# Booking data

The *Bookings* data category allows you to use data from [bookings](xref:srm_instantiations#booking) in your DataMiner System as input for components in your dashboards or low-code apps.

When you expand the *Bookings* section in the *Data* pane, a list of bookings is displayed.

To find a specific booking, you can select one of the default time ranges from the filter box (e.g., *Today so far*, *This month*, *Last 30 days*, etc.), or select *Custom* to configure a custom time range:

![Custom time range](~/dataminer/images/Custom_Time_Range_Bookings.png)<br>*Low-Code Apps module in DataMiner 10.5.6*

To use all bookings in your DataMiner System as data input, select the *Bookings* header and drag it onto a compatible visualization.

> [!NOTE]
> If you add the entire *Bookings* dataset to a dropdown, list, or tree component, you will also need to link this to a time range component.
