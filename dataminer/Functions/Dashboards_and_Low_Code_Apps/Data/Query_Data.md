# Query data

The *Queries* data category allows you to access a wealth of data in your DataMiner System by constructing custom queries using the [Generic Query Interface (GQI)](xref:About_GQI).

When you expand the *Queries* section in the *Data* pane, an alphabetical list of all previously created queries is displayed.

To add a new query, click the + icon and follow the steps described under [*Creating a query*](xref:Creating_GQI_query#creating-a-query).
