# Object manager instance data

The *Object manager instance* data category allows you to use data from [DOM instances](xref:DomInstance) in your DataMiner System as input for components in your dashboards or low-code apps.

When you expand the *Object manager instance* section in the *Data* pane, you first need to select a DOM module from the dropdown list. Once a module is selected, all available DOM instances for that module are listed. To find a specific DOM instance, you can scroll through the list or use the search field.

A common use case is to drag the entire *Object manager instances* dataset onto a component as data input and then apply a [*Object manager definition* filter](xref:Object_Manager_Definition_Data). This allows you to display all DOM instances that belong to a particular definition.
