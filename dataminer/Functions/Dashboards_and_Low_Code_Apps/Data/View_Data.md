# View data

The *Views* data category allows you to use data from [views](xref:About_views) in your DataMiner System as input for components in your dashboards or low-code apps.

When you expand the *Views* section in the *Data* pane, a list of all available views is displayed. To quickly find a specific view, use the filter box at the top of the data section.

To use all views in your DataMiner System as data input, select the *Views* header and drag it onto a compatible visualization.
