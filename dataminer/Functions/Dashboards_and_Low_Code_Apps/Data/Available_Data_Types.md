# Available data types

When you configure a component in a dashboard or low-code app, you typically need to combine a visualization with data.

The type of data you select determines what information the component will show and where that information comes from, e.g. data passed from another component or real-time values from an element, service, view, etc.

When you edit a dashboard or app, all available data types are listed in the *Data* pane under *All available data*.

- If you select a visualization first, only compatible data types can be used. Some visualizations require a specific type of data, while others support multiple types.

- If you select data first, only compatible visualization types will be shown when you hover over the component and click the ![Visualization](~/dataminer/images/DashboardsX_visualizations00095.png) icon.
