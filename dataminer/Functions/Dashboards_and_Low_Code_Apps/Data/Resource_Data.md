# Resource data

The *Resources* data category allows you to use data from [resources](xref:srm_instantiations#virtual-function-resource) in your DataMiner System as input for components in your dashboards or low-code apps.

When you expand the *Resources* section in the *Data* pane, a list of all available resources is displayed. To quickly find a specific resource, use the filter box at the top of the data section.

To use all resources in your DataMiner System as data input, select the *Resources* header and drag it onto a compatible visualization.
