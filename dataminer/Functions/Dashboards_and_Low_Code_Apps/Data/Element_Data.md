# Element data

The *Elements* data category allows you to use data from [elements](xref:About_elements) in your DataMiner System as input for components in your dashboards or low-code apps.

When you expand the *Elements* section in the *Data* pane, a list of available elements is displayed.

To quickly find a specific element, use the filter box at the top of the data section. From DataMiner 10.2.5/10.3.0 onwards, you can click the filter icon next to the filter box to get additional filtering options:

- Specify a view in the *View* bow to only load elements in that view (and its subviews).

- Specify a protocol in the *Protocol* box to only load elements using that protocol.

- Select the *EPM managers* checkbox to only load EPM Manager elements.

- Select the *Spectrum analyzers* checkbox to only load Spectrum elements.

To use all elements in your DataMiner System as data input, select the *Elements* header and drag it onto a compatible visualization.
