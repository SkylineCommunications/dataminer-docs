# Index data

The *Indices* data category allows you to use data from table parameters in your DataMiner System as input for components in your dashboards or low-code apps.

When you expand the *Indices* section in the *Data* pane, you first need to select an element or service and then a specific table parameter. Once a parameter is selected, all available indices for that parameter are listed. To find a specific index, you can scroll through the list or use the filter box.

Each index represents a unique row in the table, and selecting an index allows you to retrieve and display data specific to that row.

> [!NOTE]
> Index data can also be used as a filter in components such as the parameter table and line and area chart.
