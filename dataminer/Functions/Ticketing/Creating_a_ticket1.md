# Creating a ticket

You can create a ticket both from within the Ticketing app and from the Surveyor or Alarm Console.

- Within the Ticketing app: click the *New* button in the header bar.

- From the Surveyor or Alarm Console: Right-click the item for which a ticket should be created and select *Ticket* > *New ticket*.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can create tickets for elements, services, views, and alarms.

In either case, a *Create new ticket* form will be created, where you should do the following:

1. Check if the correct domain is displayed in the domain selector at top. If it is not, click the domain selector and select the correct domain.

1. Fill in the necessary fields (determined by the domain) and click *Save*.

> [!NOTE]
> Creating new tickets is only possible if at least one domain has been configured in the Ticketing app. Otherwise the *New ticket* option will be disabled.
