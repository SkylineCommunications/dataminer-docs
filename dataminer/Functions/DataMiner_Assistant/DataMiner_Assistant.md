# DataMiner Assistant app

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The DataMiner Assistant app is an upcoming feature that is not yet available in current DataMiner versions. The information below provides a preview of what will be available in a future release and may be subject to change.

The DataMiner Assistant is an integrated AI assistant, accessible via the [DataMiner landing page](xref:Accessing_the_web_apps#dataminer-landing-page), that helps you interact with your DataMiner System more efficiently. It can answer DataMiner-related questions and assist in interpreting data from your system.

The DataMiner Assistant relies on [context](xref:Assistant_Context) to provide the most accurate answers to your questions and requests. To tailor responses to your organization, you will be able to add your own [user context](xref:Assistant_UserContext), providing insights specific to your environment. This will complement Skyline's default context, which includes system instructions, general data descriptions, and other baseline information.

The Assistant app will be available in two tabs, each designed for a specific type of interaction: the [*Insights* tab](#insights), where it analyzes live data from your system, and the [*Documentation* tab](#documentation), where it provides conceptual and procedural guidance based on the official documentation.

Together, these two tabs will make the application a convenient way to access both system insights and reliable information.

## Insights

In the *Insights* tab, the Assistant will have access to your data and will be able to analyze it on your behalf. It will provide summaries and detailed insights into elements, alarms, and other key components of your system.

For example, you will be able to ask which alarms require immediate attention, and the Assistant will identify and prioritize them, providing possible resolution steps. This will make it easier to monitor system health and take timely action without manually going through large datasets.

## Documentation

In the *Documentation* tab, the Assistant will focus on conceptual and procedural questions. It will have direct access to DataMiner Docs, allowing it to provide accurate and up-to-date information directly from the source.

You will be able to ask questions such as which low-code app visualization type is best for large data sets, how to configure an alarm template, or how DataMiner user permissions work. The Assistant will then retrieve the relevant information for you, allowing you to find documentation content quickly without needing to browse through the DataMiner documentation manually.
