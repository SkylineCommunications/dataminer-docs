# DataMiner Assistant DxM

The DataMiner Assistant module is available as a DxM ([DataMiner Extension Module](xref:DataMinerExtensionModules)) and is responsible for bringing conversational AI into DataMiner.

The initial 1.0.0 version only supports the [natural language to GQI](xref:NL2GQI) feature, but more features, such as the [DataMiner Assistant app](xref:DataMinerAssistant), will be added soon.

> [!NOTE]
> Prior to version 2.0.0, the DxM is called "Copilot".

## Installation

DataMiner Assistant is currently not included in DataMiner upgrade packages and [needs to be deployed separately](xref:Managing_cloud-connected_nodes#deploying-a-dxm-on-a-dms-node). However, once it has been deployed, it gets upgraded when you install DataMiner upgrades from DataMiner 10.5.7/10.6.0 onwards.<!-- RN 42896 -->

To upgrade to version 2.0.0 (where Copilot is renamed to DataMiner Assistant), you will need to install DataMiner Assistant manually, even if the Copilot DxM was already installed. After that, automatic upgrades will resume.

For DataMiner Assistant to run correctly, the following **prerequisites** must be met:

- **Connection to dataminer.services**: The DataMiner System [must be connected to dataminer.services](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud).
- **GQI**: For the "natural language to GQI" feature to work, the [GQI DxM](xref:GQI_DxM) needs to be installed.

## Logging

Errors and warnings are logged to log files in the `C:\ProgramData\Skyline Communications\DataMiner Assistant\Logs` folder.

This folder will only store at most two log files. A new log file is created when the current file exceeds a predefined size. In case the folder already contains two log files, the oldest will be removed to make room for the new one.
