# Adding custom predefined questions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is currently still being developed. The description below is subject to change, and the feature may not yet be included in the upcoming DataMiner Assistant release.

When you start a new chat session in the *Insights* or *Documentation* tab, six predefined questions will be displayed to help you get started quickly. Instead of typing a question, you will be able to click one of the question tiles.

On the *Insights* tab, you will be able to use custom predefined questions to tailor the Assistant to your workflows, making it faster and easier to get the insights you need most. To add a new custom question, you will need to edit the JSON file directly:

1. On the DMA, go to the following folder: `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\assistant`.

1. Open the file *insights_questions.json*.

1. Locate the question you want to replace. Each question in the file will be defined as a JSON object with the following properties:

   | # | Property | Description |
   |:--:|--|--|
   | (1) | `icon` | Name of the [Material icon](https://fonts.google.com/icons) displayed next to the question. |
   | (2) | `title` | The text that appears as the heading of the predefined question. |
   | (3) | `content` | The question that will be sent to the Assistant when you click the predefined question. |
   | (4) | `color` | The RGB color (comma-separated values) used for the icon. |

1. Replace the existing question with your own, keeping the same structure and ensuring the JSON syntax remains valid.

   For example:

   ```json
   {
     "icon": "notifications_active",
     "title": "Active alarms",
     "content": "Can you give me a brief overview of the active alarms in my system?",
     "color": "102, 204, 0"
   }
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > Use clear and specific wording in your questions to get the most accurate responses.
