# Exporting a job to PDF

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Jobs app is obsolete. It is not supported with [STaaS](xref:STaaS) and is no longer available from DataMiner 10.5.0 onwards.

To create a PDF report of a job:

1. Select the job on the main page of the app (either in the list view or on the timeline).

1. In the header bar, click *Export*.

1. Depending on your browser settings, you may then need to select where the report needs to be stored. Alternatively, it may also be stored automatically in your usual downloads folder.
