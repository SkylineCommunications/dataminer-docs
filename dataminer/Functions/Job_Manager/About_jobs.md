# About jobs

In essence, a "job" is a description of one or more things that need to be planned in a service provider network. However, the level of a detail can differ greatly between organizations, so this is highly customizable in the Jobs app. It is possible to configure jobs with such a level of detail that the planning can occur entirely without operator intervention, for instance in case the service provider provides an online booking system or self-service portal for end-customers.
