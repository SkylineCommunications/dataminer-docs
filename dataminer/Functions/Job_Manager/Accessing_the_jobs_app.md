# Accessing the Jobs app

To access the Jobs app, depending on your setup, go to one of the following addresses in a browser:

```txt
http://[DMA]/jobs
https://[DMA]/jobs
```

> [!CAUTION]
> If you use a DataMiner version prior to DataMiner 10.1.7, we strongly advise that you use HTTPS when you use DataMiner client applications over public internet. If you do not do so, all information – including logon credentials – is sent as plain, unencrypted text over the internet. From DataMiner 10.1.7 onwards, client-server communication is encrypted by default. See also: [Setting up HTTPS on a DMA](xref:Setting_up_HTTPS_on_a_DMA).

## Accessing the Jobs app via dataminer.services

If you have been granted remote access to a DataMiner System via dataminer.services, you can connect as follows:

1. Go to the public URL of the remote DataMiner System. See [Remote access](xref:About_Remote_Access).

1. Log on to dataminer.services. See [Logging on](xref:Logging_on_to_dataminer_services#logging-on).

1. Log on to the remote DataMiner System using your DataMiner login credentials.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your DataMiner account is linked to your dataminer.services account, you will be logged in automatically with that linked DataMiner account.

1. Click the *Jobs* icon.
