# Script actions

A script consists of a series of script actions (i.e. lines). These are represented in the *Script* section of the right pane. You can add or modify script actions at any time during script configuration.

To create a script action:

- In the *Actions* section, click *Add* and select the action. This will add the script action below any actions that have already been added.

- Alternatively, to insert the new script action between existing actions, right-click the location where you want to add it, click *Insert*, and select the action.

Further configuration options depend on the type of script actions added. For more information on this, see [Automation script actions in DataMiner Cube](xref:Automation_script_actions_in_DataMiner_Cube).

However, for all script action, the following options are available with the buttons to the right of the action:

- To move an action one position up or down in the list, click the up or down triangle. Alternatively, you can also drag a script action to a different position in the script.

- To add a copy of a script action, click the duplicate icon. The duplicated script action will be added immediately below the action it is duplicated from.

- To delete an action, click the x.
