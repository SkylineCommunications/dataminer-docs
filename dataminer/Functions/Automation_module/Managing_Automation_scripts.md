# Managing Automation scripts

To manage the Automation scripts in a DMS, you need to open the Automation module (via apps \> *Automation*). When you do so, a card is opened that consists of two panes:

- A pane on the left, where all scripts are represented in a tree view. A search box at the top of the pane allows you to quickly find a particular script.

- A pane with script details on the right, where you can [view and edit scripts](xref:Designing_Automation_scripts), [execute scripts](xref:Running_Automation_scripts), <!-- [view logging](xref:Automation_logging) for a script,  -->or [create an API](xref:UD_APIs_Define_New_API) based on a script.

Managing Automation scripts, e.g. adding and deleting scripts or organizing them in folders, is done in the pane on the left:

- [Collapsing and expanding Automation script folders](#collapsing-and-expanding-automation-script-folders)

- [Adding a new Automation script](#adding-a-new-automation-script)

- [Adding a new Automation script folder](#adding-a-new-automation-script-folder)

- [Moving Automation scripts or folders](#moving-automation-scripts-or-folders)

- [Deleting an Automation script or folder](#deleting-an-automation-script-or-folder)

- [Renaming an Automation script folder](#renaming-an-automation-script-folder)

- [Importing and exporting Automation scripts](#importing-and-exporting-automation-scripts)

<!-- The Automation module also includes scripts that have been deployed as part of packages from the Catalog. From DataMiner Cube ... onwards (RN 42773, other RN TBD), the description of such scripts will indicate the name and version of the package that was used to deploy them. You can make changes to such scripts, but that does mean you are customizing the deployed package. In that case, the description of the script will display "[Customized]" in front of the package name. To restore the original script, you can redeploy the package. -->

## Collapsing and expanding Automation script folders

You can collapse or expand folders in the tree view:

- By clicking the triangle in front of the folder.

- By right-clicking the tree view and selecting *Collapse all* or *Expand all*.

- By selecting the folder, clicking the More... button at the bottom of the pane, and selecting *Collapse all* or *Expand all*.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you select *Collapse all*, the root folder will not be collapsed.

## Adding a new Automation script

To add a new script:

- Select the folder where you want to add the script, and click the *Add script* button at the bottom of the pane, or

- Right-click the folder where you want a new script and select *Add script*.

You can also add a new script by duplicating an existing script and then changing this duplicate as required.

- To duplicate a script, right-click the script and select *Duplicate*.

  Alternatively, you can also select the script, click the More... button at the bottom of the pane, and select *Duplicate*.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot create two Automation scripts with the same name.

To create a functional new script, you will then need to configure it further. For more information, see [Designing Automation scripts](xref:Designing_Automation_scripts).

## Adding a new Automation script folder

To add a new folder:

- Click the *New Folder* button at the bottom of the pane, or

- Right-click the folder where you want a new folder and select *New folder*.

> [!NOTE]
> If you create a new folder, it will only be saved if a script is added to it. Empty folders are automatically deleted when you close the *Automation* module.

## Moving Automation scripts or folders

To move scripts or folders in the Automation tree view:

- Drag the script or folder and drop it in the new location in the tree view.

## Deleting an Automation script or folder

To delete a script or folder:

- Select the script or folder, and select the *Delete* button at the bottom of the pane, or

- Right-click the script or folder and select *Delete* in the right-click menu.

> [!NOTE]
> When you delete a folder, you delete all scripts in that folder.

## Renaming an Automation script folder

You can change the name of a folder in the following ways:

- Right-click the folder, and select *Rename*.

- Select the folder and press *F2*.

- Select the folder, click the More... button at the bottom of the pane, and select *Rename*.

> [!NOTE]
> Using a period at the beginning or at the end of a folder name is not allowed.

## Importing and exporting Automation scripts

- To upload a locally stored XML file containing a script and add it to a folder, right-click the folder and select *Import*.

- To download a script as an XML file, right-click the script and select *Export*.

  Alternatively, you can also select the folder or script, click the More... button at the bottom of the pane, and select the *Import* or *Export* option there.

> [!NOTE]
> To import Automation scripts, you need the user permission *Automation: Add*. To export Automation scripts, you need the user permission *Automation: Edit*. See [DataMiner user permissions](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions).
