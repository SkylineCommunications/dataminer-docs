1. In the list on the left side of the *Automation* card, select the script to be executed.

1. Click the *Execute* button at the bottom of the pane on the right.

1. Specify the required dummies, parameters and memory files, and select or deselect the available options if necessary. For an overview of the options, see [Script execution options](xref:Script_execution_options).
