# Designing Automation scripts

In the *Automation* module, select a script in the tree view pane on the left in order to configure it in the details pane on the right. Alternatively, if you want to view the script details in a separate card, right-click the script and select *Open in new card* or *Open in new undocked card*.

Once a new blank script has been added (see [Adding a new Automation script](xref:Managing_Automation_scripts#adding-a-new-automation-script)), you can begin to configure it. To do so, you need to specify the general configuration, add script actions, and specify variables when necessary:

- [General script configuration](xref:General_script_configuration)

- [Script variables](xref:Script_variables)

- [Script actions](xref:Script_actions)

As soon as there are unsaved changes in a script, “*\[modified\]*” is added to the script name in the tree view pane, as a reminder in case you navigate to a different script. However, note that if you close the Automation module, such changes will not be saved. To make sure changes to a script are saved, click the *Save script* button. While the script is saving, you will temporarily not be able to make any other changes.

> [!NOTE]
> If a script contains errors, a warning message will be displayed in red at the bottom of the editor pane, and the *Save script* button will be temporarily disabled.
