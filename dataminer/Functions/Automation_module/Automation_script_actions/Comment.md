# Comment

Use this action to add extra comments to the script:

- Click the *Text of the comment* section and fill in the comment.

Some possible comments are of particular note:

- If you add a comment line containing *debug=true*, the debug mode will be enabled. During script execution, all comments will appear as information events. They will also be added to the SLAutomation.txt log file. A comment line containing *debug=false* disables the debug mode.

- If you add a comment line containing *skipElementChecks=true*, the script will not verify the current state of the element. This way, scripts can be executed even if included elements are in a timeout state or not active.

- If you add a comment line containing *skipInformationEvents=true*, you will prevent information events from being generated by the SET statements in the script.
