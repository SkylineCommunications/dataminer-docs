# Troubleshooting - SLProtocol

Starting from DataMiner 10.4.12/10.5.0 an SLProtocol crash will cause all elements inside the crashed process to be restarted.
Follow [Investigating element restarts due to process crashes](xref:Investigate_Reoccurring_Element_Restarts) to identify which elements and/or protocols are causing the crashes.
