# Troubleshooting - SLProtocol

Starting from DataMiner 10.4.12/10.5.0, when an SLProtocol instance crashes, all elements that depend on that instance will be restarted.

To identify which elements and/or protocols are causing this issue, refer to [Investigating reoccurring element restarts due to process crashes](xref:Investigate_Reoccurring_Element_Restarts). This procedure applies both for SLScripting and SLProtocol crashes.
