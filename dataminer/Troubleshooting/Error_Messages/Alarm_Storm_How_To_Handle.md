# What is an Alarm Storm?
When the system gets flooded with alarms, this will trigger the [alarm storm protection](xref:Alarm_storm_protection).
In short, it's a protective measure to avoiding the system to get stuck.  
  
[Alarm storm prevention](xref:Configuring_alarm_storm_prevention_for_notifications) can be configured on 3 levels.

# Symptoms
If there's an alarm storm on the system, it's visible in several ways:
* popup
* Alarm entry
The column _Parameter Description_ will indicate "Alarm storm" and column _Value_ will tell you how many alarms were generated
* Alarm Console - visual marker bottom left

# What to do
It's important to understand what triggered the alarm storm, only then you can resolve it.

have a look at the alarm details to figure out what alarm events are causing the alarm storm. 
The description in the popup gives an indication, but there could still be various alarm events found within the alarm storm itself.
