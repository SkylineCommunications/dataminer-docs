ImpactOrStateIssue{{Service impact or state issue?}}
StateIssue{{Check SLElement service states in Client Test Tool => Diagnostics => DMA. Check __service_'serviceName'.txt logging.}}
ImpactIssue{{Are there duplicate display keys from partially included elements?}}
NotFixedProtocolIssue{{Rows should have unique display keys. Contact the author of your element's connector.}}
IsolateIssue{{Try to isolate and simulate the actual issue. e.g. if the elements are partially included check if it also happens with full inclusion. e.g. does the issue occur on standalone or column parameters?}}
Alarms{{If your issue is not resolved, click this node to go to the alarm flow.}}

## Service alarm issues

If you encounter issues related to service alarms, you will need to gather the following information from the DMAs involved and then contact [support.data-core@skyline.be](mailto:support.data-core@skyline.be):

- While the issue is active on the system, [use SLLogCollector](xref:Collecting_data_to_report_an_issue_to_TechSupport#log-collector-packages) to collect **memory dumps of the SLElement, SLDataMiner, and SLNet processes** from both the Agents hosting the affected elements and the Agent hosting the affected services.

  When you share these files, make sure to also include the **element ID and service ID**, as this will help us quickly locate the relevant information in the logs and dumps.

- Provide [a **DELT export package**](xref:Exporting_elements_services_etc_to_a_dmimport_file) that includes the alarms from the affected services and elements.

- If the service was generated from a **service template**, include the template. You can find this *Service.xml* file on the DataMiner server hosting the service template in the folder `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Services\[ServiceTemplateName]`.
