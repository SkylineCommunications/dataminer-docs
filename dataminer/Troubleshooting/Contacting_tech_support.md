# Contacting DataMiner Support

When you encounter an issue with the software and you need help to resolve it, contact DataMiner Support by creating a ticket using the [Support application](xref:User_operations_support).

Alternatively, you can consult the DataMiner Community first by posting a question in the [DataMiner Dojo Q&A](https://community.dataminer.services/questions/).

If for some reason you cannot access the Support application and create a ticket, you can instead contact Skyline's Support helpdesk:

- Email: <support@dataminer.services>

- Phone (during business hours):
  - Belgium: +32 51 33 19 25
  - Portugal: +351 308 80 6270
  - United States: +1 754 218 2040

- 24/7 support (only for critical issues with severe impact; additional charges will apply):
  - All regions: +32 474 101 888
  - North America: +1 754 218 2045

For our 24/7 support terms, refer to [Out-of-business hours support](xref:Overview_Out_Of_Business_Hours_Support).

For more information about our general support terms, refer to [Support services terms: on premises](xref:Support_Terms_On_Premises) or [Support terms: SaaS](xref:Support_Terms_SaaS), depending on your setup.
