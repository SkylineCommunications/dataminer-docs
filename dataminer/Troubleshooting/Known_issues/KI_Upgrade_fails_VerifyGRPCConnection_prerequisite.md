# Upgrade fails because of VerifyGRPCConnection.dll prerequisite

## Affected versions

From DataMiner 10.5.10 onwards.<!-- RN 43506 -->

## Cause

The [VerifyGRPCConnection](xref:VerifyGRPCConnectiondmupgrade) upgrade prerequisite checks if the DMS is ready to use gRPC as the default communication type. The check can fail for two reasons:

- **Configuration**: One or more DataMiner network-related settings have been changed from their default value. This is not necessarily a problem, especially if no connectivity checks are failing, but manual intervention is required to reconsider why the setting was changed and if this could affect the switch to gRPC.

- **Connectivity**: One or more gRPC connection checks between Agents in the cluster have failed. This is a functional problem and indicates the cluster is not ready to use gRPC.

The following articles can help to analyze the configuration:

- [Overview of IP ports used in a DMS](xref:Configuring_the_IP_network_ports#overview-of-ip-ports-used-in-a-dms)
- [DataMiner Agent hardening](xref:DataMiner_hardening_guide#dataminer-agent-hardening)
- [Disabling .NET Remoting](xref:Configuration_of_DataMiner_processes#disabling-net-remoting) (MaintenanceSettings.xml)
- [Configuring the port for .NET Remoting](xref:Configuration_of_DataMiner_processes#configuring-the-port-for-net-remoting) (SLNet.exe.config)
- [ConnectionSettings.txt Options](xref:ConnectionSettings_txt#connectionsettingstxt-options) (ConnectionSettings.txt)
- [Connection strings](xref:Connection_strings) (DMS.xml)
  - [Redirects subtag](xref:DMS_xml#redirects-subtag)
  - [Editing the connection string between two DataMiner Agents](xref:SLNetClientTest_editing_connection_string)

## Fix for configuration failures

### Prerequisite fails on ConnectionSettings.txt

Error message:

```txt
ConnectionSettings.txt was changed, only default config is allowed without MaintenanceSetting flag
```

This will occur if one of the following changes have been made in *ConnectionSettings.txt*:

- Polling was configured (e.g. `polling=1000`)
- A server port other than 8004 was configured (e.g. `serverport=1234`)
- Different settings for different IP ranges have been configured.

**Fix**: Modify [ConnectionSettings.txt](xref:ConnectionSettings_txt#connectionsettingstxt-options) to use *GRPCConnection* for all clients and evaluate if Cube connections work as expected:

```txt
* type=GRPCConnection
```

### Prerequisite fails on SLNet.exe.config

Error message:

```txt
SLNet.exe.config .NET Remoting port should be 8004 but was {port}
```

This will occur if a server port other than 8004 was configured in `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Files\SLNet.exe.config` (e.g. `<channel ref="http" name="SLNetRemoting" port="1234" timeout="300000" clientConnectionLimit="200">`)

**Fix**:

1. Modify [ConnectionSettings.txt](xref:ConnectionSettings_txt#connectionsettingstxt-options) to use gRPC for all clients and evaluate if Cube connections work as expected:

   ```txt
   * type=GRPCConnection
   ```

1. [Manually disable .NET Remoting](xref:Configuration_of_DataMiner_processes#disabling-net-remoting) on all Agents and verify that Agents can still communicate correctly (by checking in Cube under *System Center* > *Agents*).

### Prerequisite fails on DMS.xml redirects

Error message:

```txt
{redirect} is not of format 'https://*/APIGateway'
```

This will occur if any non-APIGateway redirects URIs have been configured in *DMS.xml*.

APIGateway redirect URIs or username/password redirects will not trigger a failure:

```xml
<Redirects>
  <Redirect to="10.0.0.21" via="" user="dataminer" pwd="abc123" />     <!-- OK -->
  <Redirect to="10.0.0.22" via="https://10.0.0.22:443/APIGateway" />   <!-- OK -->
  <Redirect to="10.0.0.23" via="http://10.0.0.23:8004/SLNetService" /> <!-- fail -->
  <Redirect to="10.0.0.24" via="auto://nodetect/" />                   <!-- fail -->
</Redirects>
```

**Fix**: Change the connection strings to the format `https://{ip}/APIGateway` and verify whether Agents can still communicate correctly (by checking in Cube under *System Center* > *Agents*).

## Fix for connectivity failures

Error messages:

```txt
{ip}: APIGateway version check failed: APIGateway is unavailable.
{ip}: gRPC call failed: Status(StatusCode="...", Detail="...")
{ip}: No response was received
{ip}: Connection test returned an error, possible causes are APIGateway not running or port 443 is closed
```

Where the previous failures on configuration may be false positives, the connection check failures indicate a functional problem.

Verify the following items:

- Are all DataMiner Agents running?

- Is the *SLNet* service running on all Agents?

- Is the *DataMiner APIGateway* service running on all Agents?

- Is the `https://{ip}/APIGateway/api/version` endpoint reachable on all Agents and does it return the version information?

  - A **connection refused** error indicates that IIS, APIGateway, or HTTP services are not running
  - A **connection timeout** indicates a firewall issue.
  - A **404 Not Found** error indicates that either APIGateway is not running, or only IP-specific or hostname-specific bindings are defined in IIS.

- Is there a proxy configured for the SYSTEM user? Verify the output of the following commands:

  ```txt
  netsh winhttp show proxy
  reg query "HKU\S-1-5-18\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings" /f Proxy
  reg query "HKU\S-1-5-18\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings" /f AutoConfigURL
  ```

  The expected output contains this:

  ```txt
  Direct access (no proxy server).
  ProxyEnable    REG_DWORD    0x0
  End of search: 0 match(es) found.
  ```

## Workaround

It is possible to keep using .NET Remoting as the default communication type by applying the [EnableDotNetRemoting.dmupgrade](https://community.dataminer.services/download/enabledotnetremoting-dmupgrade/) package.

This upgrade package will set `<SLNet><EnableDotNetRemoting>` to true in *MaintenanceSettings.xml* on all Agents in the cluster.

This does not trigger a restart and can immediately be followed by a full upgrade to 10.5.10/10.6.0 or higher.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - If you decide to keep using .NET Remoting as the communication type between DataMiner Agents, and you add a new Agent to the cluster at some point, that Agent must also first be configured with EnableDotNetRemoting set to true.
> - Keep in mind that .NET Remoting will eventually be removed in a future version, and at that point the upgrade will be blocked again.

## Issue description

Upgrading a cluster is blocked because the *VerifyGRPCConnection* prerequisite fails.
