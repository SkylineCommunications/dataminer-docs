# SRM - Auto Select Resource not read for silent booking

## Affected versions

SRM 1.2.30 CU2.

## Cause

When a booking was created silently, the *Auto Select Resource* node property was not read.

## Fix

Install SRM 1.2.30 CU3<!--RN 35998-->.

## Description

When a booking was created silently, resources were automatically selected even if the *Auto Select Resource* node property was set to *False*.
