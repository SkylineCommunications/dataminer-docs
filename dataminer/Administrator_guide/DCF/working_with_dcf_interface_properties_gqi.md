# Working with DCF interface properties in GQI queries

In this tutorial, you will learn how to work with GQI queries that contain DCF interface information. By way of example, the tutorial will show how you can display information about the DCF interface properties using a grid visualization. Using GQI query filter components, you will then be able to filter the displayed interfaces.

Estimated duration: 20 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A DataMiner System that is [connected to dataminer.services](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud).
- Make sure the [GenericInterface](xref:Overview_of_Soft_Launch_Options#genericinterface) soft-launch option is enabled. See [Soft-launch options](xref:SoftLaunchOptions).

> [!TIP]
> If you use a [DaaS system](xref:Creating_a_DMS_in_the_cloud), these prerequisites are automatically met.

## Overview

- [Step 1: Deploy the tutorial package from the Catalog](#step-1-deploy-the-tutorial-package-from-the-catalog)
- [Step 2: Provision DCF connections and properties](#step-2-provision-dcf-connections-and-properties)
- [Step 3: Configure the visualizations](#step-3-configure-the-visualizations)

## Step 1: Deploy the tutorial package from the Catalog

To deploy the package:

1. Go to the [Kata DCF package](https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/1b2baca9-9fa6-4a62-84c1-69e836612a8e) in the Catalog.

1. Deploy the latest version of the package on your DMA using the *Deploy* button.

   The package will deploy the following components:

   - The **Generic Data Simulator** connector, which exposes DCF interfaces and will be used by the elements created for this tutorial.

   - The **SLC-AS-Kata-DCF** Automation script, which will be used to provision the view, elements, DCF interface properties, DCF connections, and properties required for this tutorial.

   - The **kata_dcf_view.vsdx** Visio file, which will be used to visualize DCF interfaces, connections, and related properties in Cube.

   - The **KATA_DCF** dashboard, located in the dashboard folder with the same name. This is the dashboard used in the previous tutorial [Getting started with DCF](xref:getting_started_dataminer_connectivity_framework) and in [Kata #45](https://community.dataminer.services/courses/kata-45/).

   - The **KATA_DCF_ADVANCED** dashboard, located in the same folder. This blank dashboard will be used for this tutorial and contains the following GQI queries:

      - **DCF_ELEMENTS**: The nodes representing the routers, switches, and PCs available in the network diagram.
      - **DCF_ELEMENTS_POSITION**: The positions for the nodes available in this tutorial.
      - **DCF_INTERFACES**: The DCF interfaces exposed by the elements created for this tutorial.
      - **DCF_CONNECTIONS**: The DCF connections created for this tutorial.
      - **DCF_CONNECTIONS_PROPERTIES**: Properties related to the DCF connections available in this tutorial.

1. When the package has been fully deployed, in the **Automation** module in DataMiner Cube, go to the folder **Kata DCF** and execute the script **SLC-AS-Kata-DCF** to provision the components required for this tutorial.

   > [!TIP]
   > See also: [Manually executing a script](xref:Manually_executing_a_script)

   When the script is complete, the following items should become available in the Surveyor:

   - Views:
     - SLC_KATA_DCF
     - 00_ROUTER
     - 01_SWITCH
     - 02_PC
     - 10_PROVISIONING

   - Elements:
     - RO-01
     - SW-01
     - SW-02
     - PC-11
     - PC-12
     - PC-13
     - PC-21
     - PC-22
     - PC-23
     - SKYLINE_GENERIC_PROVISIONING

   ![Kata DCF Advanced Provisioned Elements](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_advanced_tutorial_0.png)

1. If you have not yet done so in the [previous tutorial](xref:getting_started_dataminer_connectivity_framework), assign a Visio file to the *DLC_KATA_DCF* view:

   1. In the Surveyor, select the view *SLC_KATA_DCF*.

   1. Right-click the *VISUAL* page, select *Set as active Visio file* > *Existing*, and select the file **kata_dcf_view.vsdx**.

      If you cannot see that Visio file listed in the window, click *Other file* and browse to the folder `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Views`. You will be able to select the file there. If you do not have access to this folder, restarting the DMA will also make the Visio file become available in the window.

## Step 2: Provision DCF connections and properties

> [!NOTE]
> If you are doing this tutorial on the same system where you have already done the previous tutorial [Getting started with DCF](xref:getting_started_dataminer_connectivity_framework), you can skip this step completely, because you have already taken care of the provisioning.

1. In the **Automation** module in DataMiner Cube, go the folder *Kata DCF* and execute the script *SLC-AS-Kata-DCF-Advanced* to provision the DCF interface properties.

1. Confirm that these properties have been correctly provisioned:

   1. Open a router, switch, or PC element that was added earlier in this tutorial, and go to the page *General Parameters*.
   1. Next to *DataMiner Connectivity Framework*, click the *Configure* button.
   1. Check if the *[Interface Properties]* table contains the DCF interface property *Bandwidth* for each port available in the *Interfaces* table (4 in total).

      ![DCF Interface Properties](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_advanced_tutorial_1.png)

   > [!TIP]
   > See also: [General parameters](xref:General_parameters)

1. Open the element *SKYLINE_GENERIC_PROVISIONING*.

1. Go to the *DCF Import* page of the element and click the *Import* button.

   When the *Progress* parameter indicates 100, the *Status* parameter should indicate that 8 connections were found and imported.

1. Open the overview available in the view **SLC_KATA_DCF** (tab *dcf*) and confirm that all the DCF connections were provisioned correctly.

   The following connections should be displayed:

## Step 3: Configure the visualizations

1. Go to the [Dashboards app](xref:Accessing_the_web_apps).

1. In the pane on the left, in the *KATA_DCF* folder, select the dashboard *KATA_DCF_ADVANCED*.

1. Click the pencil icon in the dashboard header bar to start editing the dashboard.

1. Drag a *Grid* visualization from the pane on the left onto the dashboard.

    ![Grid Visualization](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_advanced_tutorial_3.png)

1. Drag a *Query Filter* visualization from the pane on the left onto the dashboard.

    ![Query Filter Visualization](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_advanced_tutorial_4.png)

1. Drag the edges of both components to resize them so they will be large enough to display all the interfaces.

1. In the *Data* pane on the right, expand the *Queries* node, and drag the query *DCF_INTERFACES* to both components.

   > [!TIP]
   > Take a look at the GQI query to further understand how the GQI query was built to retrieve the DCF interface property.

1. In the *Data* pane, expand the query *DCF_INTERFACES* and drag the *Bandwidth* column to the *Query filter* visualization.

   ![Query Filter Configuration](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_advanced_tutorial_5.gif)

1. Make sure the query filter component is selected, go to the *Settings* pane on the right, and enable the *Filter assistance* option.

   As a result, you should now see three possible suggestions for the *Bandwidth* column.

   ![Query Filter with filter suggestion](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_advanced_tutorial_6.png)

1. In the *Data* pane on the right, expand *Components* > *Query Filter*, and drag the *Query columns* item to the grid component as a filter.

   ![Query Filter in grid visualization](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_advanced_tutorial_7.gif)

1. Stop editing the dashboard so you can test the query filter.

   When one of the values available for the *Bandwidth* is selected in the query filter, only the DCF interfaces that match the value of this property will be highlighted.

   ![Query Filter in action](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_advanced_tutorial_8.png)

1. Edit the dashboard again, select the grid component, and in the *Layout* tab on the right, click *Edit* at the bottom to open the template editor.

   > [!TIP]
   > See also [Using the Template Editor](xref:Template_Editor)

1. Add two text layers to display the element name of the DCF interface and the *Bandwidth* DCF interface property:

   1. Go to the *Tools* pane on the left, select *Text*, and drag an area below the *{Name}* placeholder to add a text layer there.

   1. In the pane on the right, change the value `Text` to `{Element Name}`.

      ![Template Editor - First text layer](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_advanced_tutorial_9.png)

   1. Repeat the steps above to add another text layer below that with the value `{Bandwidth}`.

      ![Template Editor - Second text layer](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_advanced_tutorial_10.png)

   1. Click *Save*.

   The grid should now display the element name and bandwidth for each interface.
