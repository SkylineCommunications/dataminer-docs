# Getting started with DCF

This tutorial shows how you can get started with DataMiner Connectivity Framework (DCF) based on a basic example. In this example, you will create DCF connections between elements that expose external DCF interfaces and visualize them using a Visio-based overview in Cube and a node edge graph in a dashboard.

The content and screenshot of this tutorial were created in DataMiner version 10.4.11.

Expected duration: 20 minutes

> [!TIP]
> See also: [Kata #45: DataMiner Connectivity Framework (DCF)](https://community.dataminer.services/courses/kata-45/) on DataMiner Dojo.

## Prerequisites

- A DataMiner System that is [connected to dataminer.services](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud).
- Make sure the [GenericInterface](xref:Overview_of_Soft_Launch_Options#genericinterface) soft-launch option is enabled. See [Soft-launch options](xref:SoftLaunchOptions).

> [!TIP]
> If you use a [DaaS system](xref:Creating_a_DMS_in_the_cloud), these prerequisites are automatically met.

## Objective

The objective of this tutorial is to build the following network connectivity diagram in a visual overview and a node edge graph using DCF:

![Kata DCF Network Diagram](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_0.png)

Where:

- RO-x: Router
- SW-x: Switch
- 1/x: Represents the port number from the device

For example, from the diagram you can infer the following:

- RO-01 connects to SW-01 using the interface Port Ethernet 1/1.
- SW-01 connects to RO-01 using the interface Port Ethernet 1/1.
- SW-01 connects to PC-11 using the interface Port Ethernet 1/2.
- PC-11 connects to SW-01 using the interface Port Ethernet 1/1.

## Step 1: Deploy the tutorial package from the Catalog

To deploy the package:

1. Go to the [Kata DCF package](https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/1b2baca9-9fa6-4a62-84c1-69e836612a8e) in the Catalog.

1. Click the *Deploy* button to deploy the package on your DMA.

   The package will deploy the following components:

   - The **Generic Data Simulator** connector, which exposes DCF interfaces and will be used by the elements created for this tutorial.

   - The **SLC-AS-Kata-DCF** Automation script, which will be used to provision the view and elements required for this tutorial.

   - The **kata_dcf_view.vsdx** Visio file, which will be used to visualize DCF connections in Cube.

   - The **KATA_DCF** dashboard, located in the dashboard folder with the same name. This is a blank dashboard containing the following GQI queries, which are required to create the node edge graph for this tutorial:

     - **DCF_ELEMENTS**: The nodes representing the routers, switches, and PCs available in the network diagram.
     - **DCF_INTERFACES**: The DCF interfaces exposed by the elements created for this tutorial
     - **DCF_CONNECTIONS**: The DCF connections created for this tutorial

1. When the package has been fully deployed, in the **Automation** module in DataMiner Cube, go to the folder **Kata DCF** and execute the script **SLC-AS-Kata-DCF** to provision the components required for this tutorial.

   > [!TIP]
   > See also: [Manually executing a script](xref:Manually_executing_a_script)

   When the script is complete, the following items should become available in the Surveyor:

   - Views:
     - SLC_KATA_DCF
     - 00_ROUTER
     - 01_SWITCH
     - 02_PC
   - Elements:
     - RO-01
     - SW-01
     - SW-02
     - PC-11
     - PC-12
     - PC-13
     - PC-21
     - PC-22
     - PC-23

   ![Kata DCF Provisioned Elements](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_1.png)

1. In the Cube Surveyor, select the view **SLC_KATA_DCF**.

1. Right-click the *VISUAL* page, select *Set as active Visio file* > *Existing*, and select the file **kata_dcf_view.vsdx**.

   If you cannot see that Visio file listed in the window, click *Other file* and browse to the folder `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Views`. You will be able to select the file there. If you do not have access to this folder, restarting the DMA will also make the Visio file become available in the window.

## Step 2: Create external DCF connections

1. Define connections between the router and switches:

   1. In the *00_ROUTER* view, right-click the element **RO-01**, and select *Properties*.

   1. In the *Properties* window, go to the *connectivity* > *external* tab.

   1. In the *State* column, select *Connected to* for the interface *Port Ethernet 1/1*.

   1. In the *External* column, select the element **SW-01**.

   1. In the *Interface* column on the right, select the interface *Port Ethernet 1/1*.

      ![DCF Connection Visual Overview](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_2.png)

   1. Click the *Apply* button in the lower-right corner.

      This will apply your changes and create the connection. The *VISUAL* page of the *SLC_KATA_DCF* view will display the DCF connection.

      ![DCF Connection Visual Overview](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_3.png)

   1. Still in the *Properties* window, in the *State* column, select *Connected to* for the interface *Port Ethernet 1/2*.

   1. In the *External* column for this interface, select the element *SW-02*.

   1. In the *Interface* column on the right, select the interface *Port Ethernet 1/1*.

   1. Click *Apply*.

      This new connection should now also be displayed in the visual overview.

   1. Click *OK* to close the *Properties* window.

1. Define connections between the switches and PCs:

   1. In the *01_SWITCH* view, right-click the element **SW-01**, and select *Properties*.

   1. In the *Properties* window, go to the *connectivity* > *external* tab.

      You will notice that there already is a connection for interface *Port Ethernet 1/1*. This is because DCF creates both connections on both ends.

   1. In the *State* column, select *Connected to* for the interface *Port Ethernet 1/2*.

   1. In the *External* column, select the element *PC-11*.

   1. In the *Interface* column, select the interface *Port Ethernet 1/1*.

   1. Click *Apply*.

      The new connection should be displayed in the visual overview.

1. In the same way as detailed above, create the remaining connections according to the [diagram above](#objective).

> [!NOTE]
> Before you proceed to the next step, make sure all the DCF connections [shown in the diagram](#objective) have been created.

## Step 3: Create a node edge graph using DCF connections

1. Go to the [Dashboards app](xref:Accessing_the_web_apps).

1. In the pane on the left, in the *KATA_DCF* folder, select the *KATA_DCF* dashboard.

1. Click the pencil icon in the dashboard header bar to start editing the dashboard.

1. Drag a *Node edge graph* visualization from the pane on the left onto the dashboard.

   ![Node edge graph visualization](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_4.png)

1. Drag the edges of the node edge graph component to resize it so that it will be large enough to easily show all nodes in the diagram.

1. In the *Data pane* on the right, expand the *Queries* node, and drag the following queries to the node edge graph component:

   - *DCF_ELEMENTS*: This GQI query contains the nodes

   - *DCF_CONNECTIONS*: This GQI query contain the connections between the nodes

   ![Add queries to the visualization](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_5.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Although the GQI query *DCF_INTERFACES* is not used directly in the node edge graph, it is used by the GQI query *DCF_CONNECTIONS*. The GQI query *DCF_INTERFACES* contains the link between the DCF interfaces and the parameters from the element.

## Step 4: Configure the nodes

1. Select the node edge graph component you have added.

1. Select the *Settings* pane on the right.

   The queries you added earlier will be listed under *Unassigned queries*.

1. Under the query *DCF_ELEMENTS*, select *Set as node*.

   ![Select GQI query as node](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_6.png)

   The selected query will be moved to the bottom of the pane.

1. For the same query, make sure *Node ID column* is set to the column *Element ID*.

   This indicates that the *Element ID* column contains the ID representing the different entities that should be shown as nodes.

   Nine nodes should now be displayed in the node edge graph component, representing the router, switches, and PCs. By default, the icon displayed for each node is a circle.

   ![Nodes available in the GQI query](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_7.png)

1. Add an override for the **router** node:

   1. Click *Add override*.

      ![Add override to node](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_8.png)

   1. In the *Filter* box, select *Description*. A text box will now be displayed to right of the filter.

   1. In the text box, specify `ROUTER`.

      ![Select node as router](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_9.png)

   1. In the *Weight* box, specify `3`.

      This will ensure that the node representing the router is positioned at the top of the component. This is because with the default layout settings, the higher the weight of a node, the higher the position of the node in the graph.

   1. In the *Shape* box, select *Hexagon*.

      The node representing the router will now have a hexagon shape. Optionally you can also change the color of the shape by clicking the colored circle to the right of the *Shape* box

   1. In the *Icon* box, select the icon *NetworkDeviceScanning*.

      > [!NOTE]
      > To quickly find a specific icon in the list, start typing the name of the icon in the box.

   1. In the *Label* box, make sure *Name* is selected.

      The name of the device should now be displayed below the nodes.

      ![Router node fully configured](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_10.png)

1. Add an override for the **switch** nodes:

   1. Click *Add Override* again.

   1. In the *Filter* box, select *Description*, and enter the value `SWITCH` in the box on the right.

   1. Set the *Weight* to 2.

      This will ensure that the nodes representing the switches are positioned below the router node.

   1. In the *Shape* box, select *Decagon*.

      The node representing the switch will now have a decagon shape. Optionally, you can also change the color of the shape by clicking the colored circle to the right of the *Shape* box.

   1. In the *Icon* box, select *Switch*.

   1. In the *Label* box, make sure *Name* is selected.

   The nodes should now look like this:

   ![Switch node fully configured](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_11.png)

1. Add an override for the **PC** nodes:

   1. Click *Add Override* again.

   1. In the *Filter* box, select *Description*, and enter the value `PC` in the box on the right.

   1. Keep the *Weight* set to 1.

      This will ensure that the nodes representing the switches are positioned below the switch node.

   1. In the *Shape* box, select *Circle*.

      The node representing the switch will now have a circle shape. Optionally, you can also change the color of the shape by clicking the colored circle to the right of the *Shape* box.

   1. In the *Icon* box, select *ThisPC*.

   1. In the *Label* box, make sure *Name* is selected.

The nodes should now look like this:

![Switch node fully configured](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_12.png)

## Step 5: Configure the edges

1. At the top of the *Unassigned queries* list, under the query *DCF_CONNECTIONS*, select *Set as edge*.

   The query will be moved to the bottom of the pane.

1. In the *Source* box, make sure *Source element ID* is selected.

1. In the *Destination* box, make sure *Destination element ID* is selected.

The edges connecting the router and switches will now be displayed in the node-edge graph visualization.

![Edges between router and switch nodes](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_13.png)

## Step 6: Display KPIs related to a connection

By default, when you click a connection in the graph, all the information related to the connection is displayed:

![Default Connection Details](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_14.png)

In this step, you will limit the displayed information so that only the parameters *Operational State* and *Bitrate* will be shown in the connection details.

1. In the *data* pane, expand *Queries* > *DCF_CONNECTIONS*.

   The different columns of the *DCF_CONNECTIONS* query will be shown.

1. Drag and drop the columns *Bit Rate* and *Operational State* to the node edge graph component as filters.

   ![Filtering columns from the query](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_15.png)

1. Click the pencil icon in the dashboard header again to stop editing the dashboard.

1. Select a connection on the dashboard.

   Only the following properties should now be shown:

   ![Filtered Connection Details](~/dataminer/images/kata_dcf_tutorial_16.png)
