# Installing NodeRecovery

## Prerequisites

- The system needs to be Swarming-enabled. If the Swarming feature is not enabled, the process will run but will not take further actions.
- This functionality requires a DataMiner version of at least 10.6.0/10.6.2.

## Installing

- Get access to the NodeRecovery DxM (TBD)

- Install the *DataMiner NodeRecovery* DxM on all the agents in the cluster.

- The DxM will start monitoring the cluster for outages right away. No further actions will happen unless you configure a [trigger script](xref:NodeRecovery_Triggers).
