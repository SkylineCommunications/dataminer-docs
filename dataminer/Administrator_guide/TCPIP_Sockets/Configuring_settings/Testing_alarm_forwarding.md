# Testing alarm forwarding

1. Open a telnet session.

1. Connect to the TCP/IP socket that is specified in the *\<AlarmSocket>* tag of the *DataMiner.xml* file.

You should receive a message similar to the following one:

```txt
---id: 202871 previous: 202868 root: 202868---
            -> Element (2) Philips IRD
            -> Parameter (176): Audio Output Level
            -> Alarm Type : Dropped
            -> Value: 12
            -> Severity: Minor High
            -> Status: Open
            -> Time: 2012/07/18 19:26:44
            -> Userstatus: Not Assigned
```

> [!NOTE]
> Only raw alarms are forwarded via TCP/IP sockets. Alarm messages generated by the DataMiner Correlation engine, for example, are not forwarded via TCP/IP sockets.
