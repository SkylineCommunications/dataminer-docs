# Generating SMIv2 MIB files

For SNMP managers using custom bindings, it is possible to generate SMIv2 MIB files. This is only supported for SNMP managers of type SNMPv2 and SNMPv3.

Exporting such a file can for instance be of use in case you want to integrate an SNMP manager with custom bindings into a third-party system.

To do so:

1. In DataMiner Cube, go to *Apps* > *System Center* \> *SNMP Forwarding*.

1. Select the SNMP manager for which you want to export a MIB file.

1. In the *notification* tab, click the *Generate MIB file* button in the *Custom bindings* section.

1. Select the location where you want to save the export and click *Save*.
