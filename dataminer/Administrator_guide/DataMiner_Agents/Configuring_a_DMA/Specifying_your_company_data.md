# Specifying your company data

In your DataMiner System, you can store general information about your company: the name, address, telephone numbers, email address, logo, and website. The company information you provide will be used throughout the DataMiner System:

- The company name will be the name of the root view of the Surveyor.

- The email address will be used as default “From” address in all email messages sent by DataMiner.

- Report headers will include name, address and logo.

1. Go to *Apps* > *System Center*.

1. Go to the *System* tab.

1. Make the necessary changes:

   - Select a contact in the *System contact* dropdown lists for up to three contact persons.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Next to each of the system contacts, the envelope icon allows you to immediately send the contact in question an email message.

   - Add or replace details in the boxes *Name*, *Address*, etc.

   - If you want to change the company logo, do the following:

     1. Click *Change Logo*.

     1. In the *Choose new logo* dialog box, select the logo image (in *.png*, *.jpg*, *.jpeg* or *.gif* format), and click *Open*.
