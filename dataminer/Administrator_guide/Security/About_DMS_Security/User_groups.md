# User groups

DataMiner users are part of one or more groups. Groups can be granted rights according to three concepts: permissions, views and access levels. Users in those groups simply inherit the rights granted to the groups of which they are a member. User settings can also be configured at group level.

There are different types of groups:

- **Local groups**: Proprietary user groups, created and managed in DataMiner.

- **Domain groups**: User groups available in the Windows domain, managed by the domain administrator.

- **dataminer.services groups**: These groups, also known as "cloud groups", are automatically added when content is shared via dataminer.services. They are entirely managed by DataMiner, which means that you cannot modify them on the *Users/Groups* page.

> [!NOTE]
> Optionally, a user who is a member of a group can be granted a personal access level. That level will then override the access level granted to the group.
