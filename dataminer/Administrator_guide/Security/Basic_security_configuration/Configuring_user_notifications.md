# Configuring user notifications

It is possible to make sure that when an alarm occurs matching a particular alarm filter, a user will receive a notification. This can be done both in System Center and, for personal notifications only, directly from the Alarm Console or the Surveyor.

> [!NOTE]
> When a notification is sent, this is logged in the *SLNotifications.txt* log file.
