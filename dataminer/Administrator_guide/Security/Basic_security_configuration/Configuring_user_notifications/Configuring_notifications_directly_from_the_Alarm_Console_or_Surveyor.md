# Configuring notifications directly from the Alarm Console or Surveyor

To configure an alarm filter for personal notifications directly from the Alarm Console or the Surveyor:

1. Right-click an alarm in the Alarm Console or right-click an element, service or view in the Surveyor, and select *Actions \> Alert me*.

   Your user card will open on the *Alerts* tab, where a filter will be suggested.

1. Modify the suggested filter if necessary, and click *OK*.

1. In the *Delivery types* column, select one or more notification types: *Alerter*, *Email* or *SMS* (i.e. text message).

1. Click the *Apply* button in the lower-right corner.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - User notifications can also be configured on a user card.
> - Notifications can also be configured on group level. See [Configuring a user group](xref:Configuring_a_user_group).
> - Notification filters are server-side filters. As such, in Alerter, the notification filters will be added to the list of server-side filters.
