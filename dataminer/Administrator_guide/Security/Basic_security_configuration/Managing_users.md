# Managing users

In DataMiner Cube, users and user groups are usually [managed in System Center](xref:Accessing_security_in_System_Center). To configure settings for one single user, some functionality can be accessed from a [user card](xref:Viewing_user_information) instead.

To be able to do anything in DataMiner, a user always has to be a member of a specific user group. So when you [add individual users](xref:Adding_a_user), make sure they are also [added to a group](xref:Changing_group_membership_of_a_user), and make sure the necessary [permissions have been configured for this group](xref:Configuring_a_user_group).
