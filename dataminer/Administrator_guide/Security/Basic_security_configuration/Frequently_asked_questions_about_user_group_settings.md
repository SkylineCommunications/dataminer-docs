## Where can I find the clientsettings.dat files?

Users as well as user groups can have a *clientsettings.dat* file.

- The *clientsettings.dat* file of a user can be found in the folder `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Users\[UserName]`.

- The *clientsettings.dat* file of a user group can be found in the folder `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Users\SharedUserSettings\Groups\[GroupName]`.

> [!NOTE]
> A *clientsettings.dat* file only contains user settings, no computer settings.

## Which user permissions are required to manage user group settings?

If you want users to be able to assign and configure user group settings, you have to grant them one of the following user permissions:

- [Modules > System configuration > Security > Group settings > Edit all groups](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#modules--system-configuration--security--group-settings--edit-all-groups)

- [Modules > System configuration > Security > Group settings > Edit own groups](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#modules--system-configuration--security--group-settings--edit-own-groups)

## What if a user is a member of more than one group?

If a user is a member of more than one user group, default user settings for this user will be supplied from the first user group that has been assigned a set of user settings. In other words, the first user group that has a *clientsettings.dat* file will provide the settings for the user.

## When a user logs on to DataMiner Cube, which value will a particular user setting have?

See the following decision flow.

![User setting flowchart](~/dataminer/images/cube_usergroupsettings.jpg)

> [!NOTE]
> Once a user has overridden the (default) value of a setting as found in the group-level settings file, that setting will no longer be controlled by the group-level settings file. In other words, non-default values will never be overwritten.

## Which user permissions are included in which security preset?

The table below shows which user permissions are available in the default security presets available in DataMiner Cube (see [Using presets to assign rights](xref:Configuring_a_user_group#using-presets-to-assign-rights)). An x in a preset column indicates that the user permission in the first column is available in that preset.

> [!NOTE]
> Some user permissions are only available in certain versions of Cube or depending on certain DataMiner licenses.
