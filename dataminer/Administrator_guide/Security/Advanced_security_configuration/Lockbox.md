# Lockbox service for DaaS and STaaS systems

DataMiner Lockbox is an **opt-in service** designed to support controlled access requests to [DataMiner as a Service (DaaS)](xref:Creating_a_DMS_in_the_cloud) or [Storage as a Service (STaaS)](xref:STaaS) systems for a limited time period. This service is not enabled by default and is primarily intended for production systems containing sensitive information.

For more information about this service, contact your Skyline representative.

<!-- The Lockbox service ensures that Skyline cannot access your DataMiner System to perform service operations without your explicit approval. With DataMiner Lockbox, you remain in control via the [approval workflow process](#workflow) that Skyline uses to ensure that only authorized requests allow access to your system.

If you want to grant a support engineer access to your DataMiner System for troubleshooting or maintenance (e.g., installing DataMiner updates), Lockbox enables this process with your approval. Alternatively, if a Skyline support engineer cannot fully resolve an issue without access to your system, they may initiate an access request, which you then have the option to approve or deny.

Once an access request is approved, the support engineer is granted access for the specified time, after which access is automatically revoked.

## Supported services

The following services currently support DataMiner Lockbox:

- DataMiner as a Service (DaaS)

- Storage as a Service (STaaS)

## Workflow

The following workflow outlines the steps involved in initiating, reviewing, and approving access requests through DataMiner Lockbox:

1. The user experiences an issue or requires assistance with the maintenance of their DataMiner System.

1. The user submits a support request to Skyline.

1. A Skyline support engineer reviews the support request and determines whether access to the DataMiner System is necessary.

1. The support engineer submits an access request that includes the duration of the access and the particular service involved.

1. After Skyline reviews and internally approves the request, the user receives an email notification of the pending access request.

1. The user reviews the request and chooses to approve or deny it.

1. If approved, the support engineer receives a confirmation and is granted access to the DataMiner System for the duration specified in the access request.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the request is denied or expires without approval, the access request is automatically rejected, and no further action is taken.

1. The support engineer logs into the DataMiner System to perform the requested troubleshooting or maintenance tasks.

   All actions taken are recorded in the audit logs for complete transparency. You can search for and review these records.

1. Once the support engineer completes the specified tasks, an email is sent to inform the user.

1. When the specified access period ends, access to the DataMiner System is automatically revoked.
