# Securing NATS

By default, NATS does **not** employ TLS encryption, leaving communication susceptible to eavesdropping. Consequently, we **strongly recommend enabling TLS encryption** for enhanced security within your NATS cluster.

Starting from DataMiner 10.5.0 [CU2]/10.5.5, it is possible to [**migrate to BrokerGateway**](xref:BrokerGateway_Migration), which will **configure TLS automatically**. Prior to this, starting from DataMiner 10.5.0/10.5.2, this is available as a [soft-launch feature](xref:SoftLaunchOptions). If BrokerGateway is not in use, you can manually configure TLS as detailed below.

## Manual TLS configuration

> [!CAUTION]
> To manually enable TLS encryption for NATS inter-node or DataMiner-to-NATS node communication, you will need to disable automatic NATS configuration as described below. Otherwise, DataMiner could overwrite your custom NATS configuration, leaving your communication unprotected. However, this means you will become responsible for maintaining the configuration of the [*SLCloud.xml*](xref:SLCloud_xml), [*nas.config*](xref:Investigating_NATS_Issues#nasconfig), and [*nats-server.config*](xref:Investigating_NATS_Issues#nats-serverconfig) files, as well as ensuring the synchronization of the credentials in the system.

### Enabling NATS inter-node TLS communication

To enable NATS inter-node TLS communication, first [request or generate the TLS certificates](#request-or-generate-the-tls-certificates-pem-format), and then [configure the TLS certificates](#configure-the-tls-certificates).

> [!NOTE]
> This applies solely to instances involving a DMS cluster or external DxMs. If you have a single-Agent setup, all communication is confined to the local host, as there is only one NATS node.

#### Request or generate the TLS certificates (PEM format)

To generate self-signed certificates, we recommend that you **use our [scripts for generating TLS certificates](https://github.com/SkylineCommunications/generate-tls-certificates)**, available on GitHub. There is a version of the script for Linux and for Windows machines. The script requires two tools: *openssl* and the *Java keytool*. Both of these can run on Linux and Windows.

#### Configure the TLS certificates

A **NATS node** is always configured on the system where the DataMiner software is hosted. Follow the steps below for **each of the NATS nodes** in the cluster to enable inter-node TLS encryption:

1. Ensure the **NATSForceManualConfig** option is enabled (see [Disabling automatic NATS configuration](xref:SLNetClientTest_disabling_automatic_nats_config)).

   This is crucial as DataMiner does not support automatic TLS configuration on the NATS nodes and will overwrite any additional configurations in the **nats-server.config** file.

1. Update the **nats-server.config** file to incorporate the TLS section within the cluster segment.

   This adjustment is necessary to accommodate the specified location of the PEM files. For example:

   ```json
   "cluster": {
      "tls": {
         "cert_file": "absolute\\path\\to\\certificate_file\\certificate.pem",
         "key_file": "absolute\\path\\to\\private-key_file\\private-key.pem",
         "ca_file":   "absolute\\path\\to\\rootCA_file\\rootCA.pem"
      }
   }
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > The `ca_file` property is only required when self-signed certificates are used.

1. In the *Services* tab in the Windows Task Manager, stop the NATS service.

1. In the *Services* tab in the Windows Task Manager, stop the NAS services.

1. In the *Services* tab in the Windows Task Manager, start the NAS service.

1. In the *Services* tab in the Windows Task Manager, start the NATS service.

1. Verify whether TLS encryption is enabled for inter-node communication:

   1. Go to `http://localhost:8222/varz` in a browser.

   1. Check whether the `urls` property encompasses all the IP addresses of the NATS nodes configured with TLS.

   1. Check whether the `tls_required` and `tls_verify` properties are appropriately configured to **true**.

   For example:

   ```json
      "cluster": {
         "urls": [
         "[NATS_NODE_IP_ADDRESS]:6222",
         ],
         "tls_required": true,
         "tls_verify": true
      }
   ```

### Enabling DataMiner-to-NATS node TLS communication

> [!IMPORTANT]
> TLS encryption for communication between software and NATS nodes is available starting from DataMiner 10.4.3 [CU0]/10.5.0<!-- RN 38302 --> with support for CA-signed certificates (Certificate Authority-Signed Certificates). While support for self-signed certificates will be introduced later, keep in mind that for now only CA-signed certificates are supported and attempting to use self-signed certificates will result in DataMiner startup failures.

Since a **NATS node** is always configured on the system where the DataMiner software is hosted, each node must configure its own DataMiner-to-NATS TLS encryption.

Follow these steps to complete the configuration:

1. Ensure the **NATSForceManualConfig** option is enabled (see [Disabling automatic NATS configuration](xref:SLNetClientTest_disabling_automatic_nats_config)).

   This is crucial as DataMiner does not support automatic TLS configuration on the NATS nodes and will overwrite any additional configurations in the **nats-server.config** file.

1. Update the **nats-server.config** file to incorporate the TLS section.

   This adjustment is necessary to accommodate the specified location of the PEM files. For example:

   ```json
     "tls": {
       "cert_file": "absolute\\path\\to\\certificate_file\\certificate.pem",
       "key_file":  "absolute\\path\\to\\private-key_file\\private-key.pem",
       "ca_file":   "absolute\\path\\to\\rootCA_file\\rootCA.pem"
     }
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > The `ca_file` property is only required when self-signed certificates are used.

1. In the *Services* tab in the Windows Task Manager, stop the NATS service.

1. In the *Services* tab in the Windows Task Manager, stop the NAS services.

1. In the *Services* tab in the Windows Task Manager, start the NAS service.

1. In the *Services* tab in the Windows Task Manager, start the NATS service.

1. Verify whether TLS encryption is enabled for DataMiner-to-NATS communication:

   1. Go to `http://localhost:8222/connz` in a browser.

   1. Check whether the `tls_version` and `tls_cipher_suite` properties are present for each connection.

   For example:

   ```json
    "connections": [
        {
            "cid": 1,
            "kind": "Client",
            "type": "nats",
            "ip": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": 56100,
            "start": "2024-02-23T16:17:34.0336834Z",
            "last_activity": "2024-02-23T16:17:34.0699403Z",
            "rtt": "1ns",
            "uptime": "4s",
            "idle": "4s",
            "pending_bytes": 0,
            "in_msgs": 0,
            "out_msgs": 0,
            "in_bytes": 0,
            "out_bytes": 0,
            "subscriptions": 0,
            "name": "_NSS-test-cluster-send",
            "lang": "go",
            "version": "1.27.0",
            "tls_version": "1.3",
            "tls_cipher_suite": "TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"
        }]
   ```
