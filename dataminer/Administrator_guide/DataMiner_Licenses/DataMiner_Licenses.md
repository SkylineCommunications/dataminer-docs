# Obtaining a DataMiner license

There are two different types of DataMiner license, which are obtained in different ways:

- [Permanent license](xref:Permanent_license)

- [Time-based license](xref:Time-based_license)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Only customers who have received a written agreement from the Skyline Sales Department can request a DataMiner license.
> - When a DataMiner license is about to expire, a pop-up message is displayed that contains the email address to be used for all communication regarding license issues. By default, this message is displayed in Cube if less than 24 days are left before the license expires.
> - In DataMiner Cube, you can find the license information by clicking the question mark in the header bar, and then selecting the *license* tab in the *About* window. Under *Licensed options* you can find the list of DataMiner applications for which you have a license. Under *Used license counters* you can see the number of items in use compared to the total number of items allowed by the license.

> [!TIP]
> In the [Admin app](xref:About_the_Admin_app), license information for your organization is available on the *Organization* > *Overview* page.
