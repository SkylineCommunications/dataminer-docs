# Verify NATS Migration Prerequisites

This BPA test will verify whether DataMiner is ready to [migrate the NATS management to the BrokerGateway DxM](xref:BrokerGateway_Migration).

It will verify that:

- All DxMs installed on the system that use DataMiner MessageBroker are using at least version 3.0.0. This version is capable of setting up connections using BrokerGateway and can automatically switch its connection configuration at runtime.
- `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Configurations\ClusterEndpoints.json` exists and has *IgnitionValues* filled in for every entry.

This BPA test is available on demand. You can [run it in System Center](xref:Running_BPA_tests) (on the *Agents > BPA* tab). From DataMiner 10.5.0/10.5.2 onwards, it is available by default.<!-- RN 40906 -->

  Verify that the NAS/NATS services are installed. If they are missing, install them via the [SLEndpointTool](xref:Investigating_NATS_Issues#remaining-steps).

- **Service \<servicename\> v\<version\> uses \<dll name\> file version \<dll version\>. It must be at least version 3.0.0. Please update this DxM to the latest version:**

  The service is running with an outdated DLL. A minimum version of 3.0.0 is required.

  Upgrade the affected DxMs to the latest version via the [Admin app](xref:Managing_cloud-connected_nodes#upgrading-nodes-to-the-latest-dxm-versions).

- **ClusterEndpoints.json file does not exist at C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Configurations\\ClusterEndpoints.json:**

  The file `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Configurations\ClusterEndpoints.json` is missing.

  Restart the entire DMS to regenerate the file on each DMA.

- **Unable to find IgnitionValue for endpoint \<endpoint\>/IgnitionValue for endpoint \<endpoint\> is null:**

  The *ClusterEndpoints.json* file does not contain the required *IgnitionValue* data.

  Delete the existing *ClusterEndpoints.json* file and restart the DMS to recreate it.

- **Exception while reading C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Configurations\\ClusterEndpoints.json:**

  Check if another process has placed a lock on the file and release it if necessary.
