# Check Deprecated DLL Usage

This BPA test checks for the use of deprecated or outdated DLLs in QActions and Automation scripts. You can [run it in System Center](xref:Running_BPA_tests) (on the *Agents > BPA* tab).

It is available from DataMiner 10.4.6/10.5.0 onwards, but prior to DataMiner 10.5.5/10.6.0 it is known as *Check Deprecated MySQL DLL* instead.

Depending on the DataMiner version, it checks for the following DLLs, in the specified folders:

| Deprecated DLL | Deprecated since DataMiner version | Minimum safe DLL version | Folder                   |
|----------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| MySql.Data.dll | 10.4.6/10.5.0<!--RN 39370-->       | 8.0.0.0                  | `C:\Skyline DataMiner\ProtocolScripts` |
| SLDatabase.dll | 10.5.5/10.6.0<!--RN 42057-->       | N/A                      | `C:\Skyline DataMiner\ProtocolScripts` or `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Files` |

Any version lower than the specified minimum version will be considered outdated, as older versions are known to pose security risks.

If an [outdated DLL file is detected](#error) on your DMA, this indicates the use of an old file version, which may pose a potential security risk. In this event, you should always remove the DLL file.

If a [deprecated DLL file is detected](#warning) on your DMA, the file version is still up to date. However, we recommend removing the DLL file regardless to avoid potential future problems.

## Metadata

- Name: Check Deprecated DLL Usage
- Description: Checks if any protocols and Automation scripts use deprecated DLLs (MySql.Data.dll or SLDatabase.dll)
- Author: Skyline Communications
- Default schedule: Every 7 days

## Results

### Success

Result message: `No issues detected.`

### Error

An outdated DLL file was detected.

- Result message: `Outdated X.dll (version x.x.x.x) at Y detected.`

- Impact: The outdated *X.dll* file could pose a security risk, potentially exposing vulnerabilities in the system. It could also lead to problems in future DataMiner versions, as an upgrade may remove the DLL file.

- Corrective action:

  1. Stop the DataMiner Agent.

  1. Remove the *X.dll* file from the *Y* folder.

     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > When you remove the mentioned DLL file, we strongly recommend keeping a temporary copy and checking the DataMiner log files *Errors* and *Errors in Protocol* for lines mentioning missing references to the file when a QAction or an Automation script is executed.

  1. Start the DataMiner Agent.

One or multiple protocols and/or Automation scripts still use an outdated DLL file.

- Result message: `Outdated X.dll (version x.x.x.x) detected, along with the use of the deprecated Y.dll`

- Impact: The outdated *X.dll* file could pose a security risk, potentially exposing vulnerabilities in the system. It may also cause future DataMiner upgrades to fail when the BPA test detects that the DLL file is still in use.

- Corrective action:

  1. Click the ellipsis button ("...") next to the error message to access an overview of all protocols and Automation scripts that still use the deprecated DLL file.

     This overview contains the names and versions of the protocols that use the file, including the IDs and QActions in which this file is referenced, as well as the names of the Automation scripts that use the file.

     Example:

     ```JSON
      {
         "Protocols": [
            {
               "Protocol": "Generic Network Services Monitor/1.0.0.11",
               "QActions": [
               {
                  "Id": "3",
                  "Deprecated DLLs": [
                     "MySql.Data.dll"
                  ]
               }
               ]
            },
            {
               "Protocol": "iDirect Platform/10.0.1.60",
               "QActions": [
               {
                  "Id": "1",
                  "Deprecated DLLs": [
                     "SLDatabase.dll",
                     "MySql.Data.dll"
                  ]
               },
               {
                  "Id": "2",
                  "Deprecated DLLs": [
                     "SLDatabase.dll"
                  ]
               }
               ]
            }
         ],
         "AutomationScripts": [
            {
               "Name": "DeprecatedDllScript",
               "Deprecated DLLs": [
               "SLDatabase.dll",
               "MySql.Data.dll"
               ]
            },
            {
               "Name": "CheckDatabaseConfiguration",
               "Deprecated DLLs": [
               "MySql.Data.dll"
               ]
            }
         ]
      }
      ```

  1. Replace every reference to a deprecated DLL with a NuGet. See [Replacing Deprecated DLLs with NuGet Packages](#replacing-deprecated-dlls-with-nuget-packages).

  1. Stop the DataMiner Agent.

  1. Remove the outdated DLL file(s) from their folder(s) (mentioned in the result message).

     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > When you remove a DLL file, we strongly recommend keeping a temporary copy and checking the DataMiner log files *Errors* and *Errors in Protocol* for lines mentioning missing references to the file when a QAction or an Automation script is executed.

  1. Start the DataMiner Agent.

### Warning

A deprecated DLL file was detected in the ProtocolScripts folder.

- Result message: `Deprecated X.dll at Y detected.`

- Impact: The deprecated *X.dll* file could lead to problems in future DataMiner versions, as an upgrade may remove the DLL file.

- Corrective action:

  1. Stop the DataMiner Agent.

  1. Remove the *X.dll* file from the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\ProtocolScripts` folder.

     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > When you remove the DLL file, we strongly recommend keeping a temporary copy and checking the DataMiner log files *Errors* and *Errors in Protocol* for lines mentioning missing references to the file when a QAction or an Automation script is executed.

  1. Start the DataMiner Agent.

One or multiple protocols and/or Automation scripts still use a deprecated DLL file.

- Result message: `Deprecated X.dll used.`

- Impact: The deprecated *X.dll* file could lead to problems in future DataMiner versions, as DataMiner upgrades may fail when the BPA test detects that the DLL file is still in use.

  1. Click the ellipsis button ("...") next to the error message to access an overview of all protocols and Automation scripts that still use the deprecated DLL file.

     This overview contains the names and versions of the protocols that use the file, including the IDs and QActions in which this file is referenced, as well as the names of the Automation scripts that use the file.

      ```

  1. Replace every reference to a deprecated DLL with a NuGet. See [Replacing Deprecated DLLs with NuGet Packages](#replacing-deprecated-dlls-with-nuget-packages).

### Not Executed

`Could not execute test due to {ExceptionMessage}`

Click the ellipsis ("...") next to the result message to access more information about the exception.

## Limitations

The BPA test can only detect whether the DLL file is referenced directly. For example, if a QAction contains a reference to a particular DLL that references the deprecated or outdated DLL file, the BPA cannot detect this.

## Replacing deprecated DLLs with NuGet packages

### MySql.Data.dll

You can replace *MySql.Data.dll* with the [MySql.Data Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MySql.Data). This NuGet should be a drop-in replacement as it exposes the same namespace and functions.

### SLDatabase.dll

Depending on the database that SLDatabase was used to communicate with, a different NuGet package is necessary.

The QAction or Automation script will need to be adapted, as each NuGet exposes different functions and ways to interact with a database.

The following list of NuGet packages can be a good start for replacing the SLDatabase.dll:

- [Cassandra](https://www.nuget.org/packages/cassandracsharpdriver/)
- [MS SQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/microsoft.data.sqlclient)
- [MySQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MySql.Data)
- [ODBC](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.Odbc/)
- [Oracle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Oracle.ManagedDataAccess)
