# Virtual device connections

All devices monitored by your DataMiner System can be assigned a virtual IP address.

That way, you can create a virtual setup of your network that masks the underlying complexity of the actual network, which typically consists of a very heterogeneous collection of devices connected via all sorts of interfaces (TCP/IP, serial, ...).

Serial devices, for example, can be “IP enabled” and turned into virtual SNMP agents.
