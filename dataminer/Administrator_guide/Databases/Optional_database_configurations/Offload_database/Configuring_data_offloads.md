# Configuring data offloads

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is not available if [Swarming](xref:Swarming) is enabled.

## Configuring offloads to files

Offloading data to files is supported from DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.1 onwards. To do so:

1. Go to System Center > *Database* > *Offload* and select *File* in the drop-down box at the top.

1. Configure the data offloads as detailed below and set a maximum size for the combined offload files.

Offload files are located in the following folder: `C:\Skyline DataMiner\System Cache\Offload`.

- Alarm properties are located in the subfolder `Alarm_Property`.
- Alarms are located in the root folder (`C:\Skyline DataMiner\System Cache\Offload`).
- Real-time trend data are located in the subfolder `Data`.
- Average trend data are located in the subfolder `Dataavg`.

Each DMA in the cluster will generate its own files. The files available on a specific DMA will contain information about the elements hosted on that DMA.

> [!NOTE]
> Offload files are typically generated with a .csv extension. However, files generated for alarm properties will have a .dat extension, even though they contain plain text.

## Configuring the offload rate

The offload rate for trend data and alarm data can be configured in System Center.

1. In DataMiner Cube, go to *System Center \>* *Database \> Offload*.

1. To set a custom offload interval, at the top of the *Offloads* section, specify a different interval between 1 and 1440 minutes (i.e. 1 day).

   This is the offload rate at which the data will actually be sent to the offload database. The default interval is 5 minutes.

1. To configure alarm data offloads, in the *Offloads* section, select *Alarm data*. You can then fine-tune this configuration as follows:

   - If a particular table should not be included in the offloads, clear the selection from this table.

   - To customize the name of the table containing particular data in the offload database, specify a custom name next to *Remote table name*.

1. To configure real-time trend data offloads, in the *Offloads* section, select *Trend data* > *Enable data offload*. You can then specify the following options:

   - The offload type: *All parameter values* or *All changed parameter values.*

     > [!NOTE]
     > When *All parameter values* is selected, data will still be offloaded even when the parameter value has not changed. However, real-time data is written to the database with the timestamp of the last change, so that there can be multiple consecutive entries with exactly the same timestamp in that case.

   - The interval at which these offloads are generated: A number of minutes between 1 and 1440 (i.e. 1 day), or instantly.

   - The time when the offload to the database first begins, in the format hh:mm:ss. This setting is only implemented at startup, so if you change the setting while the DMA is running, it will need to be restarted for the change to take effect.

   - *Remote table name*: Allows you to customize the name of the table containing this data in the offload database. The default name is *Data*.

1. To configure average trend data offloads, select *Trend data* > *Enable dataavg offload.* You can then fine-tune this configuration as follows:

   - Next to *Offload*, specify which average trended record should be offloaded.

     The available time frame records depend on the trend window configuration. For a default configuration, the following options are available: *All time frame records* (default setting), *Only short time frame records (5 min)* and *Only long time frame records (60 min)*.

     > [!NOTE]
     > For more information on the trend window configuration, see [MaintenanceSettings.Trending](xref:MaintenanceSettings.Trending).

   - *Remote table name*: Allows you to customize the name of the table containing this data in the offload database. The default name is *DataAvg*.

1. To offload snapshots (i.e. parameter information for parameters for which the snapshot option has been set in the protocol), select *Parameter value* and *Enable snapshot offload*. The snapshot offloads can then be further fine-tuned as follows:

   - Select to offload *All parameter values* or only *All changed parameter values*.

   - Specify the offload rate (by default once every five minutes).

   - Specify the offload start time, in the format hh:mm:ss.

   - To customize the name of the table containing the snapshot data in the offload database, specify a custom name next to *Remote table name*.

   - If all previous values should be removed from the database each time a new snapshot is offloaded, make sure the option *Only keep the latest parameter value in the database* is selected. If this option is not selected, all values will be kept.

     > [!NOTE]
     > This option corresponds with the `clean="true"` configuration in the *Offload* tag in *DB.xml*. If it is activated, DataMiner will truncate the data table in the offload database before new information is added. This way, the table always contains the latest snapshot information only.

   > [!TIP]
   > In an information template, you can configure specific parameters to be included in offload database snapshots. See [Creating an information template](xref:Creating_an_information_template).

## Disabling data offloads to the offload database on element level

By default, data offloads are enabled for every element. In every *Element.xml* file, you should find the following setting:

```xml
<Element>
  ...
    <CentralOffload>true</CentralOffload>
  ...
</Element>
```

If, for a particular element, you want to disable data offloads to the offload database, you can modify this setting as follows:

1. Stop DataMiner.

1. In `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Elements\`, go to the subfolder of the element and open *Element.xml*.

1. Set the *\<CentralOffload>* tag to *false*.

   ```xml
   <Element>
     ...
       <CentralOffload>false</CentralOffload>
     ...
   </Element>
   ```

1. Save the file and restart DataMiner.

    The data associated with this element will no longer be offloaded.

## Configuring trend templates to exclude/include data in offloads

It is possible to configure whether real-time and/or average trending for particular parameters should be included in offloads. This can be done directly in the trend template containing these parameters:

1. Open the appropriate trend template in the Protocols & Templates module in Cube.

1. Click the options button in the top right corner and select *Allow offload database configuration*.

1. For each parameter, in the *Offload real-time* and *Offload average* columns, click the buttons until the correct configuration is displayed.

1. Click *OK* to save your changes.
