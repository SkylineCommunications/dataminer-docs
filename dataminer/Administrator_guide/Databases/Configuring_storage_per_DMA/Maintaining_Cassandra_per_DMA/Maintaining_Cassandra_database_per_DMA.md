# Maintaining a Cassandra database per DMA

In this section of the documentation, you can find information on how to [configure backups of a Cassandra database per DMA](xref:Configuring_Cassandra_Backups).

Additionally, to ensure optimal performance, the Cassandra database should be located on a [different drive than DataMiner](xref:Moving_the_Cassandra_database_to_a_different_disk_drive).
