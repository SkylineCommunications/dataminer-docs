# Configuring Cassandra backups

To configure a backup of Cassandra database per DMA, follow the instructions under [Backing up a DataMiner Agent](xref:Backing_up_a_DataMiner_Agent).

From DataMiner 10.1.8/10.2.0 onwards, you can also take a backup of the Cassandra database by using the [Standalone Cassandra Backup tool](xref:Standalone_Cassandra_Backup_Tool).
