# Legacy setup with MySQL or MSSQL database

In legacy DataMiner Systems using DataMiner 9.0 or older, the data storage setup involved a MySQL or MSSQL database. However, such a setup does not have access to many recent DataMiner features. We recommend using [Storage as a Service (STaaS)](xref:STaaS) instead.

While older features will continue to work with MySQL up to DataMiner 10.6.0, MSSQL is no longer supported as from DataMiner 10.3.0. For more information, see [Third-party software support lifecycle](xref:Software_support_life_cycles#third-party-software-support-lifecycle).
