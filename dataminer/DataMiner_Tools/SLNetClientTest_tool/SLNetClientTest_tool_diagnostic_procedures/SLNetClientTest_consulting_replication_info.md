# Consulting replication information for other DMAs in a DMS

It is possible to request information on the number of source elements and services on a DMA that are being replicated by other DMAs in the DataMiner System.

To do so:

1. [Connect to the DMA using the SLNetClientTest tool](xref:Connecting_to_a_DMA_with_the_SLNetClientTest_tool).

1. In the *Diagnostics* menu, select *Caches & Subscriptions* > *ReplicationInfo*.

> [!WARNING]
> Always be extremely careful when using the SLNetClientTest tool, as it can have far-reaching consequences on the functionality of your DataMiner System.
