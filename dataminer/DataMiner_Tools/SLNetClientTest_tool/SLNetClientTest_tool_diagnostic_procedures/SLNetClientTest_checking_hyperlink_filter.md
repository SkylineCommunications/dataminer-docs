# Checking a hyperlink filter

Filters can be specified with a [filterElement](xref:HyperLinks.HyperLink-filterElement) attribute in Hyperlink tags in *Hyperlinks.xml*. In the SLNetClientTest tool, you can test such filters:

1. [Connect to the DMA using the SLNetClientTest tool](xref:Connecting_to_a_DMA_with_the_SLNetClientTest_tool).

1. Go to *Offline Tools* > *FilterElementChecker*.

1. Specify the filter in the *Filter as string* section.

1. On the right, specify the object that has to match the filter.

1. Click *Check Filter* to check whether the filter is valid and matches the specified object.
