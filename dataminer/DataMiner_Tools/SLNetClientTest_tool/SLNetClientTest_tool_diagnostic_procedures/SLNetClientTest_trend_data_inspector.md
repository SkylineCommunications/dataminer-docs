# Consulting the trend data inspector

Go to *Advanced* > *Tests* > *Trend Data Inspectorâ€¦* to open the *Trend Data Inspector*. In this window, you can request trend data for a certain parameter and inspect the raw database records.

If you notice that certain trend graphs contain gaps that should not be there, the *Trend Data Inspector* can help you find the reason why those graphs contain gaps.
