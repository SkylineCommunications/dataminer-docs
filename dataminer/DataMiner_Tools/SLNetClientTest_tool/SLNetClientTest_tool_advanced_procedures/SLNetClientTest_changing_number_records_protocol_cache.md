# Changing the number of records in the protocol cache

You can customize how many records can be contained in the protocol cache, for instance to tweak the performance of a DMA. However, **always check with Skyline** before you make any changes to this setting, as an **incorrect configuration can cause serious issues**.

To change this setting:

1. [Connect to the DMA using the SLNetClientTest tool](xref:Connecting_to_a_DMA_with_the_SLNetClientTest_tool).

1. Go to *Advanced* > *Options* > *SLNet Options*.

1. Select *protocolCacheMru* in the drop-down box at the top of the pop-up window.

1. Right-click the current value and select *Edit Value*.

1. Specify the new value in the pop-up window and click OK.

1. Click OK again to close the *SLNet Options* window.

> [!WARNING]
> Always be extremely careful when using the SLNetClientTest tool, as it can have far-reaching consequences on the functionality of your DataMiner System.
