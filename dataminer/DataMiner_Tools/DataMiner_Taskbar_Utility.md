# DataMiner Taskbar Utility

DataMiner Taskbar Utility is a small system tray application that you will find on every DataMiner Agent.

When the Utility is running, the DataMiner icon will be displayed in the system tray. Hover over the icon to check the current status of the DataMiner Agent:

- “started” or

- “stopped”

> [!NOTE]
> When the DataMiner Agent is running, the DataMiner Taskbar Utility generates an information event each time it is used by someone to perform an action.
