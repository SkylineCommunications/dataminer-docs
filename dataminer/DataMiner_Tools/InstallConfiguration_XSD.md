# InstallConfiguration Schema file

For unattended installation of DataMiner, a correctly configured *InstallConfiguration.xml* file is required. You can check the validity of this file using this XSD.

> You can download this tool from [DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/download/installconfiguration-xsd-to-be-used-from-dataminer-10-1-0-onwards/).

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a DataMiner version **older than DataMiner 10.1.0**, you will need a different XSD file, which you can also download from [DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/download/installconfiguration-xsd/).

> [!TIP]
> For more information about unattended DataMiner installation, see [Unattended DataMiner installation](xref:Unattended_DM_installation).
