# Working with the Alerter alarm list

The *Alarms* tab lists the last 100 alarms Alerter has received.

For every alarm in the list, the *Status* column shows you whether or not the alarm has already been processed and whether or not a pop-up balloon has already been shown.

On this tab, you also find the following button:

- **Cancel Pending Alarms**: Click this button in case of a so-called alarm storm (i.e. when huge amounts of alarms are coming in all at once).
