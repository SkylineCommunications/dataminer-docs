# Configuring Alerter pop-up balloons

By default, a pop-up balloon only shows the alarm severity, element name, parameter name, parameter value and timestamp. However, it is possible to configure the balloons to also show any of the alarm properties that can be shown in the DataMiner Cube Alarm Console.

To do so:

1. Go to *Settings \> Balloon*.

1. For every property you wish to add, click the *Add property* button, and select the property. E.g. *Service impact*, *Services*, etc.

1. To remove a property, select it in the list of additional properties, and click *Remove property*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The default properties cannot be removed.

1. To change the order in which the additional properties will appear in the balloon, use the *Up* and *Down* buttons to move a selected property accordingly.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - You can add as many alarm properties to the pop-up balloons as you like. If too many properties are added to show them at once in the balloon, it will be possible to scroll through them with a scrollbar.
> - An element name, service name or view name will be underlined to indicate that you can click these to respectively open the element, service or view information in your default client application.
