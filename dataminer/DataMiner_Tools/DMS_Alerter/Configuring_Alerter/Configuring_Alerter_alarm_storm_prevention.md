# Configuring alarm storm prevention in Alerter

In case many alarms occur at the same time, it is possible to make sure that you are not flooded with alarm notifications. Instead, an alarm storm can be triggered, so that you receive only one notification that warns about the start of an alarm storm.

To configure alarm storm prevention:

1. Go to *Settings \> Filter*.

1. Click the button *Alarm storm prevention*.

1. In the *Alarm storm prevention* window, select *Override default alarm storm prevention*

1. Enter the *Minimum number of alarms* that triggers an alarm storm, and specify whether this number should be counted *Per filter* or *For all filters*.

1. Below this, enter the time span in which these alarms need to occur.

1. Click *OK*.

> [!NOTE]
> Alerter alarm storm prevention can also be configured on system level, rather than on user level only. For more information, see [Configuring alarm storm prevention for notifications](xref:Configuring_alarm_storm_prevention_for_notifications).
