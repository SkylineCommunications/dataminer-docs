<br>Trap Sender packet configuration and bindings

When a packet is selected in the pane on the left, the middle section of the SNMP Trap Sender window displays the following two sections:

- *Packet configuration*:

  - The *IP Address*Â and *Port* fields are applicable for all SNMP versions

  - The other fields are different for each SNMP version, i.e. they are SNMP version-specific. If you select an SNMPv1 trap, you will see different fields than when you select an SNMPv3 trap.

- *Bindings*: Regardless of the SNMP version, this section displays a list of OIDs, with their type and value
