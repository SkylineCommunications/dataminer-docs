# Spectrum simulation protocol

To test DataMiner Spectrum Analysis, a spectrum simulation protocol is available. You can for example use it to verify the "set parameter" commands that SLSpectrum sends to the protocol, or to get a trace on the screen and test the various features of the spectrum user interface and spectrum monitoring without a real device. You can even simulate various carriers and amplitudes that closely resemble real-life use cases.

To use this protocol:

1. Deploy the protocol from the [Catalog](https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/6f33ec9f-e83d-49d5-8f85-87ad66eaa5c7).

   > [!TIP]
   > See also: [Deploying a Catalog item to your system](xref:Deploying_a_catalog_item)

1. Create an element that uses this protocol.

> [!NOTE]
> For detailed information about this protocol, see [Skyline Spectrum Simulation](https://docs.dataminer.services/connector/doc/Skyline_Spectrum_Simulation.html).
