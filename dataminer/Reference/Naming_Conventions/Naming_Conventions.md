# Naming of elements, services, views, etc.

Names of elements, services, views, redundancy groups, templates and folders can contain any combination of characters. However, some characters may not be used for certain items.

In addition, we strongly advise to adhere to a strict naming convention, as it can significantly improve the efficiency of your management platform. You could, for instance, use element names that contain element metadata like physical location, type of element (e.g. AMP, ORX, HPA, MOD, ...), etc.

For optimal sorting, use a leading 0 for all numbers below 10, e.g. use 05 instead of just 5.

The names of most objects in DataMiner have a limit of at most 150 characters.

The name of each element, service, view and redundancy group should always be unique.

For more information on naming, refer to the following topics:
