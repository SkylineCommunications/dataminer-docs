# Replacing a dead Cassandra node (Linux)

This article describes how you can replace a non-functioning or "dead" Cassandra node running on a **Linux** system. It is applicable for Cassandra versions 3.7 and 3.11 at the time of writing.

Please make sure to validate the required steps with those provided by the Apache Cassandra team. See the [official documentation for Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/).

## Requirements

- Basic Cassandra knowledge
- Access to the Cassandra cluster infrastructure
- Server administrator rights
- DataMiner administrator rights

## Procedure

### Install a new blank Cassandra node

Deploy and install a new blank Cassandra node in the network.

It is important to start from a new **blank Cassandra installation** to prevent any conflicts.

### Update the existing Cassandra nodes

If the dead Cassandra node was a seed node, change the cluster's seed node configuration on each node.

To do so, in the *cassandra.yaml* file of each node, replace the IP address of the dead node from the seeds list with the IP address of the new node.

*Example of seeds list in Cassandra.yaml file*

After you have updated the configuration, restart the Cassandra service:

1. Stop the Cassandra service, using the following command:

    ```txt
    sudo service cassandra stop
    ```

1. Find the Cassandra java process ID and then kill the process using its PID. Use the following commands:

    ```txt
    ps auwx | grep cassandra
    sudo kill {PID}
    ```

1. Start the Cassandra service, using the following command:

    ```txt
    sudo service cassandra start
    ```

### Update the new node

1. Stop the Cassandra service on the new node, using the following command:

    ```txt
    sudo service cassandra stop
    ```

1. Find the Cassandra java process ID and then kill the process using its PID. Use the following commands:

    ```txt
    ps auwx | grep cassandra
    sudo kill {PID}
    ```

1. Clear all data from the new node, using the following commands:

    ```txt
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cassandra/*
    sudo rm /etc/cassandra/cassandra-topology.properties
    ```

1. In the *Cassandra.yaml* configuration file, update the following fields:

   - Cluster_name: Must be set to the same value as other nodes in the cluster. Example: `cluster_name: 'DMS'`
   - Listen_addres: The server host IP. Example: `listen_address: 192.168.1.204`
   - RPC_Address: The server host IP. Example: `rpc_address: 192.168.1.204`
   - Seed list: Must be set to the same value as is configured on the other nodes in the cluster. Example: `seeds: "192.168.1.201,192.168.1.202"`
   - auto_bootstrap: If this setting exists and is set to false, set it to true: `auto_bootstrap: true`

### Start the new node with the replace_address option

On the new node, edit the Cassandra-env.sh file and add the following:

```txt
JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcassandra.replace_address_first_boot={ip of dead node}"
```

For example:

![Example of how to start the new node](~/dataminer/images/ReplaceDeadNode2.png)

When this is done, start the Cassandra service, using the following command:

```txt
sudo service cassandra start
```

Check whether the new node remains in the DN state until bootstrapping is completed. You can check progress using the following command:

```txt
nodetool netstats
```

Confirm that the new node has replaced the dead node using the following command:

```txt
nodetool status
```

![Example of how to confirm that the new node has replaced the dead node](~/dataminer/images/ReplaceDeadNode3.png)

After the node bootstraps, remove the *replace-address* parameter from the *Cassandra-env.sh* file.

### Run a repair

This step is only necessary if the node has been down for longer than the time configured for the *max_hint_window_in_ms* setting in the *cassandra.yaml* file. By default, this is 3 hours.

In this case, use *nodetool* to run a repair. For more information, see <https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/tools/nodetool/repair.html>.

### Update DataMiner

In DataMiner Cube, go to *System Center > Database*. In the *DB server* box, replace the IP address of the dead node with the IP address of the new node.

For example, in DataMiner 10.2.0:

## Time estimate

| Item | Activity | Duration |
|------|----------|----------|
| 1    | Installing a new blank node   | 30 min.     |
| 2    | Updating the existing nodes   | 5 â€“ 10 min. |
| 3    | Updating the new node         | 5 min.      |
| 4    | Starting the new node with the replace_address option | a few minutes to multiple hours,<br>depending on the size of the dataset |
| 5    | Running a repair (only if node was down longer than max_hint_window_in_ms) | a few minutes to multiple hours,<br>depending on the size of the dataset |
| 6    | Updating DataMiner | 1 min. |
