| AppPackages | Uploaded and installed *.dmapp packages. | Partially (only *Installed* subfolder) |
| AssetManager | DataMiner Inventory and Asset Management configuration. Only the *Configs*, *Cache*, and *MediaConfigs* subfolders are synchronized in a DMS. | Partially |
| Backup | Backup settings, backup DLLs, backed-up data. | Partially |
| BPA | BPA tests. See [Running BPA tests](xref:Running_BPA_tests). | Partially (all except *Default* subfolder) |
| Certificates | Certificates for TLS encryption. See [Enabling TLS encryption for serial communication](xref:Enabling_TLS_encryption). | No |
| ClusterNodes | Cluster configuration for Agents connected to dataminer.services. | Partially (only *Configuration* subfolder) |
| Configurations | Contains information about the endpoints in the cluster, required to be able to [migrate to BrokerGateway](xref:BrokerGateway_Migration). | No |
| Connectivity | *Connectivity.xml* files. See [About DCF](xref:About_the_DataMiner_Connectivity_Framework). | Yes |
| Correlation | Correlation rules. See [About Correlation](xref:About_DMS_Correlation). | Yes |
| Dashboards | Configuration for the [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D). | Yes |
| Database | Database-related configuration files. See [Database](xref:Database). | Partially |
| DeployerTokens | Used for the *APIDeployment* soft-launch feature, which is obsolete as of DataMiner 10.4.0. | Yes |
| Documents | Documents added to the DataMiner Agent. | Yes |
| Elements | Element data (one subdirectory per element). See [Elements](xref:Elements1#elements). | No |
| Files | EXEs, DLLs, configuration files, etc. | No |
| Filters | Filters. | No |
| Generic Interface | GQI queries. See [About GQI](xref:About_GQI). | Yes |
| Icons | Custom icons. See [Icons](xref:Icons). | Yes |
| Jobs | Contains configuration related to the migration of the [Jobs](xref:jobs) module to the indexing database. | No |
| Logging | Log files. | No |

| Ownership | Currently unused. | No |
| ProtocolFunctionManager | Advanced SRM configuration. See [Advanced SRM settings](xref:Function_resource_settings). | Yes |
| Protocols | A subdirectory for every protocol installed on the DMA.<br> Each of these protocol subdirectories contain a subdirectory for every version of that protocol. | Yes |
| ProtocolScripts | External scripts, DLLs, and compiled QActions. Most of the content of this folder is synchronized in a DMS, except for any `*.QAction.*.dll` files, because those are generated by SLScripting on each DMA when the protocol QActions are compiled. However, note that it is not possible to add files directly in this folder or its subfolders; this must always be done using the appropriate DataMiner call. | Partially |
| Recycle Bin | Backup of changed data. See [Recycle bin](xref:Recycle_bin). | No |
| Redundancy | Redundancy group configuration. | No |
| RemoteServices | Services hosted on other DMAs in the cluster. Each of the subfolders in this folder has the DMA ID of the DMA hosting the synchronized services. | Yes |
| ResourceManager | Resource Manager configuration. | No |
| Scripts | Automation scripts. | Yes |
| Security | Within this folder, only the *Credentials* subfolder, which contains the credentials library configuration, and the *Ownership* subfolder are synchronized. | Partially |
| ServiceManager | Service Manager configuration. | No |
| Services | Services hosted on the DMA. | See note below. |
| SharedItems | Information about dashboards that have been shared on dataminer.services. See [Sharing a dashboard](xref:Sharing_a_dashboard). | Yes |
| Simulations | Simulation files. | No |
| Sounds | Custom alert sounds. See [Configuring a custom alert sound for an alarm tab](xref:ConfiguringACustomAlertSoundForAnAlarmTab). | Yes |
| Spectrum Alarm Recordings | Alarm records of spectrum elements. | No |
| System Cache | See [System Cache](xref:System_Cache). | No |
| Ticketing | Contains configuration related to the migration of the [Ticketing](xref:ticketing) module to the indexing database. | No |
| Tools | Tools (StandaloneUpgrade, etc.). Within this folder, only the *SLLogCollector* subfolder is synchronized in the DMS. | Partially |
| Upgrades | Information concerning the last upgrade. | No |
| Users | Stored user information. See [ClientSettings.json](xref:ClientSettings_json#clientsettingsjson). This includes private and public [alarm filters](xref:Alarm_filters) (with public alarm filters being stored in the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Users\SharedUserSettings\Filters` subfolder). | Yes |
| Views | Visio files. | Yes |
| VisualData | Visual Data Manager configuration. | No |
| Webpages | All webpages of the DataMiner client applications. Within this folder, only the following things are synchronized in a DMS:<br>- The *CustomerLogo* image files.<br>- The *Public* subfolder (from DataMiner 10.5.10/10.6.0 onwards<!-- RN 43458 -->).<br>- The data for legacy dashboards (`C:\Skyline DataMiner\WebPages\Dashboards\Db\`).<br>- The data for legacy reports (`C:\Skyline DataMiner\WebPages\Reports\Templates\`), except for the `tmp_img` subfolder, which contains temporary files.<br>- The data for legacy annotations (`C:\Skyline DataMiner\WebPages\Annotations\DMS Images\` and `C:\Skyline DataMiner\WebPages\Annotations\Views\`). | Partially |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The synchronization of files across all DMAs in a DataMiner System happens every day at midnight (00:00). It is therefore of great importance that the time settings of the DMAs are synchronized as well. For more information, see [How do I synchronize time settings within a DMS?](xref:General_configuration#how-do-i-synchronize-time-settings-within-a-dms)
