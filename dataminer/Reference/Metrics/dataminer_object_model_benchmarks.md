## Load Test

### Specifications

- Intel i7-12700 (12 core / 20 threads)
- 32 GB DDR5 RAM (4800 MT/s)
- SSD (NVMe) (850K Write IOPS)
- Windows 11 Pro (10.0.22621 Build 22621)
- Elasticsearch version 6.8.23 (8 GB allocated memory)
- DataMiner version 10.3.9

### Summary

A load test was performed using DOM models representing 'transport stream' data. DOM definitions representing 'service', 'PID', and 'transport stream' were created, each containing around 20 fields. Using realistic data, 5,000,000 DOM instances were sequentially created, with a fairly constant average creation time of approximately 90 ms. The Elasticsearch index size reached about 45 GB. Query performance using a GQI query in a low-code app remained consistently smooth compared to a system with significantly less DOM instances.
