| 5 | Retrieve all service alarms of last 24h | DMS | 2.24 s | Test retrieves all service alarms of the last 24h (2,000). | DMA only contains the elements, services, DVE elements and views needed for this test. No other data on it. Also, no other tests are running. |
| 6 | Retrieve all view alarms of last 24h | DMS | 27.96 s | Test retrieves all view alarms of the last 24h (28,622). | DMA only contains the elements, services, DVE elements and views needed for this test. No other data on it. Also, no other tests are running. |
| 7 | Retrieve all element alarms of last 24h | DMS | 17.22 s | Test retrieves all element alarms of the last 24h (20,000). | DMA only contains the elements, services, DVE elements and views needed for this test. No other data on it. Also, no other tests are running. |
| 8 | Retrieve all alarms of last hour | DMS | 26.95 s | Test retrieves all alarms of the last hour (28,622). | DMA only contains the elements, services, DVE elements and views needed for this test. No other data on it. Also, no other tests are running. |
| 9 | Retrieve all service alarms of last hour | DMS | 2.13 s | Test retrieves all service alarms of the last hour (2,000). | DMA only contains the elements, services, DVE elements and views needed for this test. No other data on it. Also, no other tests are running. |
| 10 | Retrieve all view alarms of last hour | DMS | 25.87 s | Test retrieves all view alarms of the last hour (28,622). | DMA only contains the elements, services, DVE elements and views needed for this test. No other data on it. Also, no other tests are running. |
