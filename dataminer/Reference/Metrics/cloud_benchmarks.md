## Benchmarks

| \# | Specification | Scope | Metric | Remarks |
| -- | ------------- | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| 1 | Evaluation of API call through the Web Application Firewall (WAF), e.g. for a shared dashboard.<br>Evaluation of 50 simple static rules per request, with 200 threads running in parallel. | DMS | 730,000 evaluations/second ||
| 2 | Evaluation of API call through the Web Application Firewall (WAF), e.g. for a shared dashboard.<br>Evaluation of 50 simple custom filter rules per request, with 200 threads running in parallel. | DMS | 35,000 evaluations/second ||
| 3 | Evaluation of API call through the Web Application Firewall (WAF), e.g. for a shared dashboard.<br>Evaluation of 50 rules with simple custom filter with LINQ operation, with 200 threads running in parallel.<br>LINQ operation executed on a collection of 1,000 items. | DMS | 644 evaluations/second ||
| 4 | Time to create 10 shares with blank dashboards. | DMS | 83 s | Test ran 4 times. The average time was taken from the results. |
| 5 | Time it takes for a single shared item to become available. | DMS | 55,122 ms | Test ran 4 times. The average time was taken from the results.<br>First-time share is roughly twice as slow compared to any subsequent share. |
