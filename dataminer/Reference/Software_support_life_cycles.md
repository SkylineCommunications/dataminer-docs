# Software support lifecycles

## DataMiner support lifecycle policy

If you are following the **Feature Release** track, you always need to **upgrade to the latest version** to get the latest security updates. If you do not want to upgrade to a new Feature Release version but do want to get the latest security updates, you will need to switch to the Main Release track instead.

For the **Main Release** track, the following support is available:

| Version | Regular updates until | Supported until     | *Limited support until* |
|---------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 10.6.0  | 19 Nov 2027           | **23 Feb 2029**     | *22 Feb 2030*           |
| 10.5.0  | 20 Nov 2026           | **25 Feb 2028**     | *23 Feb 2029*           |
| 10.4.0  | 21 Nov 2025           | **26 Feb 2027**     | *25 Feb 2028*           |
| 10.3.0  | 15 Nov 2024           | **27 Feb 2026**     | *26 Feb 2027*           |
| 10.2.0  | 24 Nov 2023           | **28 Feb 2025**     | *27 Feb 2026*           |

Older versions are no longer supported.

Legend:

- **Regular updates**: Monthly cumulative updates containing fixes and security updates.
- **Supported**: Security updates and critical bug fixes only (as required).
- **Limited support**: Online technical help without software updates for fixes, security updates, or features.

> [!NOTE]
> For security updates with third-party dependencies that are only compatible with a later version of DataMiner, it will be necessary to upgrade to this later version.

> [!TIP]
> See also [DataMiner Main Release vs. Feature Release](xref:DataMiner_MR_vs_FR).

## Third-party software support lifecycle

| Item | Current status | Detail | Future status |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Support for MySQL as local database | End of Engineering | Existing features will work, but some new features will require [Storage as a Service](xref:STaaS) (recommended) or [dedicated clustered storage](xref:Dedicated_clustered_storage). | End of Support as of DataMiner 10.6.x (Q4 2025). |
| Support for Cassandra Single | End of Engineering | Support will end for setups where each DMA has its own Cassandra database. Instead we recommend switching to [STaaS](xref:STaaS). Though this is not recommended, you can also use [dedicated clustered storage](xref:Dedicated_clustered_storage) instead. | End of support as of DataMiner 10.7.x (Q4 2026). |
| Support for Elasticsearch 6.8 | End of Engineering | As Elastic no longer supports Elasticsearch 6.8 (or lower), support for this will also end in DataMiner. We highly recommend switching to [STaaS](xref:STaaS). Though this is not recommended, you can also use [OpenSearch](xref:OpenSearch_database) instead. | End of support as of DataMiner 10.7.x (SQ4 2026). |
| Support for Amazon Keyspaces Service, Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra Service, and Amazon OpenSearch Service | End of Support as of DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU8]/10.3.11 | Feature will no longer be supported. We recommend switching to [Storage as a Service](xref:STaaS). Note that, though not recommended, using a self-managed OpenSearch database remains supported. | End of Life as of DataMiner 10.5.x (G4 2024). |
| Support for Cassandra versions prior to 4.x | End of Support | Cassandra versions older than Cassandra 4.x are no longer supported on any operating system.| End of Life as of DataMiner version 10.7.x (Q4 2026).|

| Support for Cassandra database on Windows OS | End of Support as of Cassandra 4.x | Cassandra no longer supports Windows as its operating system from version 4.x onwards. Consequently, from DataMiner 10.4.x onwards, Cassandra databases on Windows up to Cassandra version 3.11 are no longer supported. We recommend moving to a Linux system, using [Ubuntu LTS](https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/c6285161-e8c7-4be3-a8b3-20259b20815b). | |
| Support for MSSQL as local database | End of Life as of DataMiner 10.3.x (Q4 2022) | Feature will no longer be supported. We recommend switching to [Storage as a Service](xref:STaaS). | End of Life as of DataMiner version 10.3.x (Q4 2022). |
| Support for DataMiner Cube running in Internet Explorer/Edge in IE compatibility mode (XBAP) | End of Life | Existing features will work, but some new features will only be supported in the DataMiner Cube desktop app. | End of Life as of DataMiner version 10.3.x (Q4 2022). |
