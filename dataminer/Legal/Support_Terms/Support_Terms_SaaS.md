Credits (a) do not apply to other amounts User may owe Skyline, (b) apply to outstanding or future invoices only, and (c) must be requested in good faith and through a documented submission of an Issue ticket within thirty (30) days after the end of the relevant month in which Skyline did not meet the Monthly Uptime for the SaaS. Skyline is not required to issue refunds or to make payments against Credits under any circumstances, including without limitation termination of this Agreement.

## 4. Support, Ticketing

Skyline shall provide Support to the User for Issues. On-site support is not included in the Support Services.

When the User encounters an Issue with the SaaS or wishes to receive Support for another reason, the User can at their choice open a ticket for Support or call Skyline's Support helpdesk.

Tickets for Support can be generated through dataminer.services.

Support is available during Business Hours only, except if the User has purchased an Out of Business Hours Support plan. If the User wishes to create a ticket in follow-up of their telephone support, the User needs to generate a ticket through Skyline's dataminer.services.

The User can always consult the status of their tickets on Skyline's dataminer.services. The ticket number will be used by Skyline for the entire lifecycle of the specific Issue or question.

To be able to assist the User in an efficient manner, when generating a ticket or calling Skyline's Support helpdesk, when reasonable required, User shall provide (a) reproducible test case, and (b) any log files, trace and systems files. The User's failure to provide this information may prevent Skyline from identifying and fixing the Issue.

## 5. Ticket Priority Levels

Depending on the Priority Level of a ticket, Skyline will address the ticket within the time frames set out below. Response Time will commence once the ticket for the Issue has been created by the User. Corrective Time will commence once Skyline is able to reproduce the Issue. Corrective Time does not include the time when the Issue is on status "Awaiting Customer Input" or "Corrective Action Proposed". When the Corrective Action consists of an action plan, it shall always conclude the planned next steps, required User actions, and, if possible, a timeline for the next steps.

The following Priority Levels shall be distinguished and assigned by Skyline:

Level 1 priority: a condition where an occurrence renders the SaaS entirely unusable for the User, and no workaround is available. This includes for example a complete outage of the SaaS.

Level 2 priority: a condition where an occurrence partly renders the SaaS inoperative for the User (possibly solved by means of workarounds or fallback mechanisms).

Level 3 priority: A condition where an occurrence affects the SaaS but does not have a significant operational impact for the User (possibly solved by means of workarounds or fallback mechanisms).

| Priority Level | Availability | Response Time | Corrective time |
|--|--|--|--|
| Level 1 | Business Hours | 1 Business Hour | 12 Business Hours |
| Level 2 | Business Hours | 8 Business Hours | 16 Business Hours |
| Level 3 | Business Hours | 24 Business Hours | N/A |

## 6. Miscellaneous

Credits provide User's sole remedies and Skyline's sole liabilities and responsibilities for Downtime, below-target Monthly Uptime, and below-target Issue Response - and Corrective time; provided this sentence does not restrict User's right, if any, to terminate their SaaS agreement for material breach.
Under no circumstances is Provider required to issue Credits in excess of 50% of any calendar month's fees.
