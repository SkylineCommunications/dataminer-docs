# Terms for partners

When submitting the partnership application on Skyline Communications' website, by selecting the checkbox, you confirm that you have read, have understood, and agree to be bound by the Partner Program Terms below, including any linked policies. This action constitutes a legally binding acceptance of the terms under Belgian law.

## 1. Partnership Eligibility

Skyline Communications reserves the right to decline any partnership application without the obligation to provide a reason.

## 2. Partnership Termination

While we value long-term relationships, Skyline Communications may terminate a partnership at any time, provided a three-month notice is given, and any active commitments are honoured. However, immediate termination is possible if Skyline Communications finds justifiable reasons, such as actions that harm Skyline Communications' reputation, involvement in fraudulent activities, or any other serious misconduct that contradicts our values and principles. Partners may also choose to terminate the partnership under these terms.

## 3. Confidentiality

Any confidential information shared by Skyline Communications during the partnership must only be used for purposes directly related to the partnership. It should not be exploited or disclosed for competitive purposes or any other activities beyond the scope of our agreement.

## 4. Orders and Conditions

Orders placed with Skyline Communications are subject to [our terms and conditions of sale](xref:Terms_of_Sale). Skyline Communications does not accept back-to-back arrangements unless expressly approved in writing. Any deviations from this policy require Skyline Communicationsâ€™ explicit written consent.

## 5. Independence

Both Skyline Communications and its partners operate as independent entities.

## 6. Intellectual Property

This agreement does not imply any transfer of intellectual property rights. Skyline Communications remains the sole owner of its intellectual property.

## 7. Liability

Skyline Communications is not liable to partners for any damages or losses, except in cases of intentional misconduct by Skyline Communications.

## 8. Partnership Rules

The commercial and practical aspects of the partnership are [detailed](xref:About_Partner_Program) on our partner platform and are considered accepted by the partner upon agreement to these terms. Our goal is to foster meaningful and mutually beneficial partnerships, which requires a commitment and positive engagement from all involved parties.

## 9. Additional Policies

Other policies, including data protection and privacy statements, may also govern the partnership.

## 10. Changes to Terms

Skyline Communications reserves the right to modify these terms or related policies. Partners will be notified of any material changes, and continued participation in the program will constitute acceptance of the updated terms.

## 11. Superseding Previous Agreements

Acceptance of these terms signifies the termination of any prior partnership agreements with Skyline Communications, including but not limited to "DSP MoU", "Strategic Partnership Agreement", "Reseller", or "Consultancy Agreement". Only the current terms will apply moving forward.

## 12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These terms are governed by Belgian law. In the event of any disputes arising from these terms, exclusive jurisdiction shall be granted to the courts of Kortrijk, Belgium.
