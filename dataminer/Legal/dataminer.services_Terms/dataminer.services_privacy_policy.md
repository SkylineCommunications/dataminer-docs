# dataminer.services Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Skyline Communications NV ("Skyline", "we", "our") collects and processes personal data when you use the dataminer.services platform and related services.

## Data controller

**Skyline Communications NV**  
Ambachtenstraat 33

Email: <privacy@skyline.be>

## Personal data we collect

### Account information

When creating an account, we collect your first and last name, email address, and information from your chosen identity provider (if applicable).

Authentication is handled through Microsoft Azure AD B2C or an approved provider such as Google or Microsoft.

Skyline does not have access to or store your login credentials.

### Use of the platform

When you use the platform, we automatically record certain information to ensure proper operation, auditing, and security. The information we collect consists of:

- Date, time, and details of actions (e.g., deployments, Catalog activity, sharing actions).

- The email address of the user performing the action.

- Technical information such as the device type, browser, and operating system.

- IP address and user agent (stored in IIS logs for security and troubleshooting).

Audit logs are available within the [Admin app](xref:About_the_Admin_app) and may also be retained in the system backend.

### Analytics and metrics

To improve our services, we use:

- **Google Tag Manager**, which triggers scripts and events but does not store data itself.

- **Google Analytics (GA4)**, which collects pseudonymized usage data such as country, session duration, and visited pages.

  IP addresses are truncated and not stored in full.

- **CookieHub**, which manages user consent for analytics and stores a random token, truncated IP address, and browser information.

All analytics are used solely to understand usage patterns and improve performance.

### Community (Dojo)

If you participate in the Community (Dojo), we process:

- Your name and email address.

- Profile details (avatar, bio, optional birthday).

- User activity and learning progress (points, ranks, badges, completed lessons).

- Contributions (questions, comments, posts).

- Swag shop details when applicable (shipping name, address, phone, company).

These data are used to operate the community platform, maintain reputation and progress, and process orders placed in the Dojo shop.

### Credits and payments

We do not store or process payment information.

Credits can be purchased through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace or via Skyline's Sales team.

We only store the credit balance linked to an account or organization within dataminer.services.
