# Proactive Support - Low Disk Space

If the DataMiner [support application](xref:User_operations_support) detects a critical level of low disk space on a specific drive for a specific DataMiner Agent, the automatic proactive support will kick in. This means that you will receive an email notifying you that low disk space has been detected, and a Collaboration task will be generated with the purpose of resolving this issue.

## What to do when you receive this notification?

### As the responsible person

1. Verify the disk drive volume.

1. Clean up the disk drive to guarantee that there is at least 15 GB of free space.

1. Follow the steps detailed under [Keeping a DMA from running out of disk space](xref:Keeping_a_DMA_from_running_out_of_disk_space).

### As a member of Skyline Tech Support

In case the flow cannot determine the main customer stakeholder of the linked Maintenance & Support contract, the notification is forwarded to Skyline Tech Support to make sure the following is done or delegated:

1. Identify the customer stakeholder on collaboration (e.g. confirm with the Product Owner).

1. Configure the main customer stakeholder in the Maintenance & Support contract and/or parent project.

1. Send the notification to the customer so they can take the necessary actions to prevent issues.
