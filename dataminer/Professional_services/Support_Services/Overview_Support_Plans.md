# Support plans

## About

DataMiner support plans are technical support services for the DataMiner core platform, connectors, and cloud services. Three support plans are available, providing different levels of support depending on the user's needs and goals.

<sup>[1]</sup>Upgrades and updates can be downloaded/deployed from dataminer.services. Note that installing these on your system is not part of our support services.

<sup>[2]</sup>Technical support and connector development and updates are charged per hour as [professional service credits](https://community.dataminer.services/service-credits/). Access to updates to the DataMiner core software is included.

> [!NOTE]
> While this section refers to support during business hours, you can also subscribe to the [out-of-business-hours support](xref:Overview_Out_Of_Business_Hours_Support) add-on to *Continuity* and *Evolve*.

For additional information, consult the [FAQ section](xref:FAQs_Support_Services)

### Community

The *Community* plan enables access to Skyline's Operations team through the forum ([questions](https://community.dataminer.services/questions/) section) and unlimited access to technical resources such as the learning materials, tutorials, or code examples. [Proactive support services](xref:Proactive_Support) are included in this plan.

While software updates to the DataMiner core software are included, connector updates and access to remote technical support (i.e. Operations team) are charged per hour.

This plan is primarily intended for DataMiner platform users who have a [Community Edition](https://community.dataminer.services/usage-based-pricing/), pay-per-use systems, or entry-level subscriptions.

### Continuity

The *Continuity* plan provides unlimited remote technical support during business hours, software updates and upgrades for the core software and connectors, proactive support services, and guaranteed response and corrective action times.

This is the standard support plan for users with perpetual-use licenses and subscriptions starting from a minimum Monthly Utilization Allowance.

### Evolve

The *Evolve* plan goes beyond standard support, adds improved response and corrective times, and offers more personalized support as well as strategic guidance from our experts, including:

- A dedicated appointed support contact.
- Direct message channel access (available on Microsoft Teams).
- A dedicated customer success team
- Quarterly executive reviews.

The *Evolve* plan goes beyond premium support; it is a partnership between the user and Skyline to leverage DataMiner to its full potential, adopting an agile mindset to support your continuous evolution.

Because its foundation is mutual commitment, the Evolve plan is not sold as a separate commercial product. To upgrade from *Continuity* to *Evolve*, an organization must have a [DataMiner DevOps](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-devops-professional-program/) team in place, and they must accumulate [DevOps Points](xref:DevOps_Points) attesting to that team's engagement and effort.

> [!NOTE]
> The number of DevOps Points measured at the end of the calendar year is the number used in the next support renewal to determine the support plan, i.e. *Continuity* or *Evolve*.

## Minimum requirements for each level

The three levels mentioned above are available for usage-based services. However, the Community plan is not available for perpetual-use licenses. The requirements listed below determine your support level.

| Plan | Usage-based services | Perpetual-use licenses |
|---|:-:|:-:|
| Community | Included | - |
| Continuity | MUA >= 200 DataMiner credits | Active Support Services agreement |
| Evolve | MUA >= 200 DataMiner credits <br>  **50,000 DevOps Points** | Active Support Services agreement <br> **50,000 DevOps Points**  |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All support plans require an active connection to [dataminer.services](xref:Overview_dataminer_services).

## Professional Service credits included

Support plans may include free [Professional Service credits](xref:Professional_service_credits) based on the commercial model and the number of licenses or usage. This is a yearly time budget to support and consult your team.

| Usage-based services | Perpetual-Use Licenses |
|:-:|:-:|
|  100 < MUA < 200: 100 <br> 200 < MUA < 400: 200 <br> MUA >= 400: 400 | 200 <br> Only available with Evolve plan |

> [!NOTE]
> These Professional Service credits must be used within the contracted year. They will not be carried over to the next year.
