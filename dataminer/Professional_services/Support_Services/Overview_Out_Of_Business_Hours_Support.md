# Out-of-business-hours support

Last-minute and planned work may require interventions outside of business hours. When subscribing to Support Services, users have the option to extend the service to out-of-business-hours (OBH) support or to request this service ad hoc for such interventions.

|                             | OBH subscription                                               |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Objective**               | Support critical operations; ensure maximum uptime.            |
| **Requirements**            | Active subscription for a support plan - Continuity or Evolve. |
| **Response times**          | Level 1: 30 min                                                |
| **Corrective action times** | Level 1: 2 hrs                                                 |

**Last-minute work** means *level 1 priority* issues with a direct *impact on the system*. The corrective work done for these issues focuses on minimizing their impact on the software and on the system.

**Planned Interventions** refers to planned work, reserved 10 days ahead of the intervention.

> [!NOTE]
> Out-of-business-hours support is available for level 1 priority issues and planned intervention work. For more information, see [Support services terms](xref:Support_Terms_On_Premises).

## Out-of-business-hours subscription (OBH subscription)

The OBH add-on is available as a monthly or yearly subscription. This fee covers the standby service, with an additional [hourly fee](https://community.dataminer.services/service-credits/) for services performed outside of business hours.

Opting for a yearly subscription not only provides a discounted fee but also includes a number of credits that can be used for OBH interventions.

When a user subscribes to this service, Skyline sets up remote access and produces a detailed document describing the system implemented to equip the team working outside of business hours with the necessary information to best assist the user in case of planned or last-minute interventions.

The user then gets access to a **dedicated 24/7 hotline** and over-the-phone support 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, with **guaranteed service** for last-minute interventions.

## Ad hoc out-of-business-hours services without an active OBH subscription

Without an OBH subscription a user can still request support for last-minute interventions. After the intervention, the user will be charged for a one-month OBH subscription and the number of credits corresponding to the [intervention](https://community.dataminer.services/service-credits/).

> [!WARNING]
> Without an active OBH subscription, outside-of-business-hours support for last-minute interventions is provided best-effort; we will do our best to assist you, but we cannot guarantee a timely or satisfactory resolution. This is because the detailed handover documentation is not prepared without a subscription, which means our support team may not have remote access to the system or the necessary knowledge about your specific implementation to fix the issue. We recommend an OBH subscription for critical operational systems, to enjoy full support coverage and avoid any potential disruptions or delays.
