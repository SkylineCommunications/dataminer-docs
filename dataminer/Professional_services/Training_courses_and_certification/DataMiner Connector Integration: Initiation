# DataMiner Connector Integration: Initiation Training

Building a connector may sound straightforward, but it requires a solid foundation to get it right. The Initiation Training is your starting point. 
The training equips you with the fundamental skills to design and build DataMiner connectors, combining theory with extensive hands-on practice.
Through exercises on protocol structure, UI components, device data handling, QActions, and traps, you will learn how to create functional connectors that integrate smoothly into DataMiner.

## What you will learn

### Competencies

By the end of the training, you will have developed the ability to:

  - Understand and apply DataMiner connector protocol structure.
  - Design and configure UI components.
  - Work with device data using SNMP standalone parameters, flows, and tables.
  - Write and debug QActions for logic implementation.
  - Manage traps effectively.

### Goals

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

  - Build a functional DataMiner connector covering UI, data handling, and logic.
  - Apply QActions and traps in practical scenarios.
  - Confidently take the next step toward advanced integration (Mastership).
