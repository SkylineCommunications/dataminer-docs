# DataMiner Connector Integration: Initiation Training

Building a connector may sound straightforward, but getting it right requires a solid foundation. The Initiation Training is your starting point.

This training equips you with the **fundamental skills to design and build DataMiner connectors**, combining theory with extensive hands-on practice. Through exercises on protocol structure, UI components, device data handling, QActions, and traps, you will learn how to create functional connectors that integrate smoothly into DataMiner.

## What you will learn

### Competencies

By the end of the training, you will have developed the ability to:

- Understand and apply DataMiner connector protocol structure.
- Design and configure UI components.
- Work with device data using SNMP standalone parameters, flows, and tables.
- Write and debug QActions for logic implementation.
- Manage traps effectively.

### Goals

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Build a functional DataMiner connector covering UI, data handling, and logic.
- Apply QActions and traps in practical scenarios.
- Confidently take the next step toward advanced integration (mastership).
