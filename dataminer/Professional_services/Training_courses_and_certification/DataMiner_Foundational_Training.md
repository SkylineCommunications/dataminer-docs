# DataMiner Foundational Training

The DataMiner Foundational Training provides a solid introduction to working with DataMiner. It combines theory, demonstrations, and hands-on exercises to help you and your team unlock the full potential of your DataMiner System.

This training is available in three formats:

- **On-site training**: Private training at your facilities for larger teams.
- **Open training**: Public sessions hosted at Skyline offices and other locations.
- **E-learning**: A self-paced online program on [DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/learning/courses/dataminer-foundational/).

## Who should attend?

This training is designed for:

- Developers, operators, and administrators new to DataMiner.
- Teams who want a structured introduction to DataMiner features and best practices.
- Professionals who need to configure, operate, or maintain a DataMiner System in their daily work.

## Training formats

### On-site training sessions

In case DataMiner training is needed for a large group of people, this option brings a qualified DataMiner expert trainer to your facilities. With this private crash course, you and your team will be able to get the best out of your DataMiner System in no time.

### Open training sessions

DataMiner Open Training sessions are open public sessions bringing together participants from different companies.

After attending the DataMiner Open Training, you will have the opportunity to book your exam with one of our experts and earn a **DataMiner Certificate of Expertise**. 

A certification voucher is included in the registration fee when you complete a full training track:

### E-learning

Prefer learning at your own pace? The [e-learning version](https://community.dataminer.services/learning/courses/dataminer-foundational/) of this training is available on our community website. It follows the same structure as the open or on-site training program, enriched with videos, exercises, and self-assessments.
