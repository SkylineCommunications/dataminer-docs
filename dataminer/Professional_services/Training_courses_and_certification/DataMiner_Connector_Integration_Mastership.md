# DataMiner Connector Integration: Mastership Training

Once you have mastered the basics, you can take your connector skills to the next level with the Mastership Training. This training builds on your initiation knowledge and prepares you to **design complex, advanced connectors**.

You will dive deeper into internal structures, advanced serial and HTTP communication, DVEs (DataMiner Virtual Elements), and specialized UI components like tree controls and matrices. Practical exercises and real-world work cases will help you become confident in handling complex integration scenarios.

## What you will learn

### Competencies

By the end of the training, you will have developed the ability to:

- Explain and work with advanced connector internal structures.
- Configure and troubleshoot serial communication (basics, advanced, and smart).
- Integrate devices using HTTP.
- Build and manage DVEs.
- Implement advanced UI elements like tree controls and matrices.
- Solve end-to-end real-world cases.

### Goals

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Design and implement advanced DataMiner connectors.
- Confidently handle serial and HTTP device integrations.
- Apply DVEs, tree controls, and matrices in complex scenarios.
- Tackle real-world connector challenges independently.
