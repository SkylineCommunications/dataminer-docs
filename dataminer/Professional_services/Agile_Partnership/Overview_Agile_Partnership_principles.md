# Principles agile partnership

Skyline Communications aims to create an agile partnership with its users. Below are some of the principles determining how both companies can work together.

- Together, the customers/users and Skyline Communications create a Project Squad with **only one clearly defined goal**.

- The customers/users and Skyline Communications fully **embrace the agile partnership**, based on the general agile principles, which especially value collaboration, responding to change, working software, and individuals & interactions.

- The customers/users and Skyline Communications define **clear accountabilities** for everybody in the Project Squad, being: the product owner, DevOps engineers, stakeholders, business representative, and end users.

- The customers/users and Skyline Communications **fully acknowledge the known and unknown challenges** ahead and will work together to mitigate those when they become relevant: change management, responsibility to balance time budgets, etc.

- The customers/users and Skyline Communications fully embrace the **key methodologies and principles** required to be successful: transparency, weighing value vs. effort, early demonstrators, the value of retrospect, stakeholder involvement, etc.

- The customers/users and Skyline Communications leverage **tools and technology** to stay focused on the execution: Collaboration, dataminer.services, Microsoft 365, Teams, QA automation, deployment automation, etc.
