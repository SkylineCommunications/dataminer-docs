# Delivering value

One of the **key objectives during the execution of any digital transformation project is the delivery of value**. To ensure that value is delivered as early as possible and gradually increases throughout the execution process:

- The process of delivering value already starts during the inception of the project, instead of only during execution.

- Value delivery can be considered at various levels, starting from the top-level overall project down to more detailed activities. It is a general mindset that must be applied throughout.

- Value should be defined as an outcome or a result, not a feature or capability.

- Value goes beyond features or capabilities and for example also includes adoption of those features and capabilities.

> What really matters are the goals & objectives and to what extent their expected value can be delivered. Ultimately, the value results from the actual implementation, not from the level of compliance with the initial requirements.
