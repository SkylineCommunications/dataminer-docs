# Managing technology deployments

## Methodology is key to success

Aside from the choice for the right technology as well as carefully considered architectural choices, a successful Digital Transformation also heavily depends on how you manage the processes for the design and deployment of that new technology.

Methodology is very comparable to strategy in a battle. It has the power to determine the outcome of a project, regardless of how powerful the chosen technology (the battle gear) is, and of how skilled the people (the soldiers) are. In history, the most powerful armies have been defeated based on strategy.

In that respect, Skyline is not only a leading technology supplier, but also a trusted partner for the users of its technology to establish the entire framework, context, and environment they need to address the broader set of challenges that come with this type of project, and to ensure that the envisioned key objectives will be achieved. After all, the key objectives are the only thing that matters in the end, and the technology deployment is only there to serve that purpose.

With deployments of its DataMiner technology in over 100 countries around the globe for leading ICT media and broadband operators, Skyline has gained unique experience and insights. Based on that, it offers its customers instant access to invaluable expertise, proven tailored methodologies, and an all-round collaborative cloud ecosystem with proven workflows to support deployment processes. In so doing, Skyline is delivering not just a technology but effectively success.
