# Agile Scope-Based Methodology

The Agile Scope-Based project methodology is most suitable for projects with well-defined goals and objectives (i.e. high-level requirements) that at the same time also still have a lot of unknown factors, both from a user expectation and from a technical implementation perspective (e.g. ambiguous requirements, no well-defined exact user expectations, unknown technical dependencies, etc.). However, it also suits projects with the ambition to put the best possible DataMiner solution in place A) within a fixed time frame and a well-defined fixed budget, and B) which will effectively but also reasonably live up to the expectations defined in those goals and high-level requirements.

This methodology is comparable to the typical agile approach of an ICT software development or ICT integration project, but with a fixed pre-defined budget and implementation timeline that all involved parties commit to comply with. The methodology embraces change where necessary to deal with the unknown as efficiently and continuously as possible, and hence does not rely on rigid formal Change Request procedures, for example. The Project Squad, consisting of both Skyline experts and user representatives, applies the agile mindset and methodologies to the maximum extent and leverages continuous feedback from and interaction with the end users to continuously deliver maximum value, to deliver the best possible solution by the anticipated end date of the project and this also within the allocated budget.

IMPORTANT:

All involved parties must understand and acknowledge that it is impossible to have all imaginable features and capabilities, as can be envisioned by all individuals directly and indirectly involved in the project and as can be derived from the initial goals and requirements, all effectively delivered in an unlimited fashion within the fixed agreed time frame and budget.

In other words, there is a budget and time boundary that all parties agreed upon, which also represents a finite capacity that cannot absorb an unlimited number of ideas, thoughts and opinions to be implemented. Nevertheless, all parties do trust that by working Agile, A) they will effectively deliver maximum value with their solution, as compared to any other methodology and given the time and budget boundary they agreed upon, and B) the solution can effectively fully comply with the overall goals and requirements defined, if they choose for it to do so (i.e. the Project Squad has the freedom to evolve their requirements if that can benefit the overall project outcome).

> [!NOTE]
> If any of the aspects of the Agile Scope-Based methodology feel uncomfortable, this is very likely because the nature of the project at hand does not fit an Agile Scope-Based type of methodology. In other words, if the project is very well defined, there is no reason not to very meticulously plan it so that it can be closely managed in terms of progress, and any risks can be mitigated from a very early stage already, then the Turnkey Project methodology is the way forward.
