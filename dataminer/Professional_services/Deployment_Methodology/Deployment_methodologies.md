# Deployment methodologies

Skyline offers three distinct deployment models for its DataMiner technology, each with its own distinct set of terms and conditions, both commercially and from a practical or process point of view.

The table below summarizes the three methodologies and how the nature of the project at hand defines the type of methodology that needs to be applied to be successful and effective.

| | [Turnkey](xref:Turnkey_Methodology) | [Agile Scope-based](xref:Agile_Scope-Based_Methodology) | [Agile Time & Materials](xref:Agile_Time_Materials_Methodology) |
|--|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Good for:** | Basic monitoring-only projects, classic applications like management of an earth station, monitoring of a DTH network, etc. | SRM orchestration projects, automation projects, complex integration projects, complex MoM and end-to-end OSS/BSS solutions, etc. | SRM orchestration projects, automation projects, complex integration projects, complex MoM and end-to-end OSS/BSS solutions, etc. |
| **Scope:** | Clearly defined and very exact project scope and user requirements. | High-level requirements and scope-/goal-oriented. | Undefined or not required to start execution. |
| **Uncertainty:** | Low level of uncertainty and ambiguity regarding user expectations. | Uncertainty about exact expectations and considerable unknowns. | Maximum agility, as budget is not necessarily a limiting factor. |
| **Changes:** | Low risk for changes, both from a requirement and technical implementation perspective. | Changes expected throughout execution due to evolving requirements and unknowns. | Fully flexible, with time expenditure, goals, and priorities managed by the user, with the objective to maximize value delivery. |
| **Pricing:** | Fixed price, mutually agreed deployment time frame. | Fixed price, with agreed time frame based on high-level requirements and scope. | Expertise delivered at an hourly rate. |
| **Methodology:** | Typically offered in two commercial stages, i.e. consultancy & implementation. Uses waterfall methodology managed by a Project Manager. | Scope is agile but balanced in terms of budget and timing, managed by the Project Squad. | Project Squad chooses the exact methodology (Scrum, Kanban, etc.). |
| **Change Management:** | Changes governed by a formal Change Request procedure. | Time budget is fixed and continuously managed throughout execution. | Clear agreement required on expected mid- and long-term availability of Skyline resources. |
| **Time Frame:** | Fixed agreed time frame | Fixed agreed time frame | Continuous progress |
| **Budget:** | Fixed agreed time budget | Fixed agreed time budget | Fixed chosen budget |
| **Requirements:** | Clear and very specific requirements, no room for interpretation | High-level requirements, well-defined goals and objectives | Goal- and objective-driven |
| **Approach:** | Process- and tool-oriented | Focus on individuals and interactions with constraints on available time | Focus on individuals and interactions |
| **Documentation:** | Comprehensive documentation and specifications | Continuously evolving high-level documentation and maximum focus on working software | Delivering working solutions early on |
| **Decision-Making:** | Contract- and specification-driven | Collaboration-driven towards an agreed well-defined goal within a set time frame | Collaboration-driven |
| **Execution:** | Executing the plan | Working towards the goal, with flexibility to easily respond to change, with time constraints in mind | Responding to change |
| **Typical examples:** | Basic monitoring-only projects, classic applications like management of an earth station, monitoring of a DTH network, etc. | SRM orchestration projects, automation projects, complex integration projects, complex MoM and end-to-end OSS/BSS solutions, etc. | SRM orchestration projects, automation projects, complex integration projects, complex MoM and end-to-end OSS/BSS solutions, etc. |
