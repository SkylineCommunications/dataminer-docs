# Key Values & Principles

In an Agile Scope-Based project, there is maximum trust that all involved parties and individuals have the desire and ambition to deliver the best possible solution within the allocated time frame and hence also within the allocated budget, and to do so as efficiently as possible. That is the common high-level objective for everybody involved, the foundation of the Agile methodology.

> "Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand." <br>*– Norm Kerth*

Everybody accepts the undeniable fact that not all requirements and technical challenges are very well known at the start of the project, and that this is simply the nature of this type of project. Everybody understands that assumptions that were made by all parties may change over time, and that entirely new important requirements could even surface. It would be extremely cumbersome and challenging, very likely even impossible, to create an exact specification and solution design to execute the project as a Turnkey Project. However, that does not stand in the way of the ambition to build and deploy the best possible solution, within the allocated time frame and budget. In fact, the Agile methodology is the industry’s proven methodology for this type of project, and it effectively delivers the best results in the most efficient manner under these kinds of circumstances.

The methodology involves continuously considering value in the context of the goals, objectives and requirements that were defined, to weigh that against the effort to implement it, and to make wise choices on where time is spent first with the Project Squad. Knowing that the industry average of unused features lies between 55% and 75%, the likeliness that a feature will be used by the end user should also be taken into consideration.

The Project Squad is receptive to change and will not focus on the initial requirements in the first place. Instead they will look at the defined goals and objectives, and the reality of what they come across, while of course also being very conscious about the available time budget and execution time frame.
