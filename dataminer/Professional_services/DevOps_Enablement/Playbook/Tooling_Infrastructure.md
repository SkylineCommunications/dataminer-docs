As soon as possible, each participant should take the following steps:

1. Create a personal [dataminer.services account](https://skyline.be/dataminer/dataminer-services) to access all free information available to the DataMiner DevOps Community.

1. Enroll in the [DataMiner DevOps Professional Program](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-devops-professional-program/) to begin earning DevOps Points for your contributions.

1. Request access to the [DataMiner Live Demo System](https://skyline.be/learn/demo) to familiarize yourself with DataMiner.

For the next steps, candidates will need assistance from Skyline, reaching out to their Account Manager for support with:

1. Creating/Joining a DataMiner Cloud organization that corresponds with their company name.

1. Inquiring about using [DataMiner as a Service (DaaS)](xref:DaaS_hosting).

1. Setting up a staging environment for their organization dedicated to training and development.

1. Creating a GitHub account and exploring Skyline Communications' public GitHub repositories.

To start analyzing connectors and complete certain exercises, install Microsoft Visual Studio and the [DataMiner Integration Studio (DIS) extension](xref:Overall_concept_of_the_DataMiner_Integration_Studio).

DIS is compatible with Visual Studio Community, Visual Studio Professional, and Visual Studio Enterprise. Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio for Mac are not supported.

> [!TIP]
> For more information about installing and configuring DIS, see [Installation and configuration](xref:Installing_and_configuring_the_software).

Additionally, install **Microsoft Visio** to utilize the DataMiner Visual Overview functionality. This feature enhances Microsoft Visio drawings with DataMiner functionality using special shape data fields, enabling highly customized graphical user interfaces. Using Visio, you can open and edit drawings to tailor information presentation in DataMiner to your preferences.
