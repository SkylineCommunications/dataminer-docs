# Joining the DevOps Enablement Program: the onboarding process

After identifying candidates, **the Facilitator**, a Skyline employee familiar with the DevOps Enablement Program, arranges a Meet & Greet call involving all candidates and the Sponsor. The Facilitator is responsible for making all the coordinations, motivating the participants, keeping them accountable, and progress reporting to stakeholders.

The **Sponsor**, typically the executive or manager, is the one investing in training candidates for a DevOps team.

After the initial introductions, the Facilitator gives a detailed explanation of the DevOps Enablement Program and address any queries from the group.

The next step involves **selecting the appropriate learning track(s) for each candidate** based on the provided matrix, requiring candidates to discuss their background and job responsibilities.
