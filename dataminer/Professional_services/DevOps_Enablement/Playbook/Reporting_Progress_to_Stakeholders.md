# Reporting progress to the stakeholders

An important part of the DevOps Enablement Program is transparency. After all, an organization is investing time and resources to create a team of agile DevOps engineers to take ownership of their operations using DataMiner. It is therefore important to provide regular progress reports to the Sponsor and other stakeholders.

Task status upkeep within [Collaboration (dataminer.services)](https://collaboration.dataminer.services/) falls under the responsibilities of the Facilitator.

Regular email reports should be sent to the stakeholders with information regarding the remaining credits, milestones achieved, decisions made, and any other information of interest.
