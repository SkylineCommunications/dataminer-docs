# DevOps Enablement Playbook

Take your Digital Transformation to the next level with DataMiner, the key technology in your journey.

The transitions we face today are fundamentally different from those we have encountered in previous decades. Today you are not simply moving an existing business and workflows to a new generation of technology. Instead, All-IP, virtualized, and cloudified products create endless possibilities to shape a business in many ways.

However, the focus is not solely on technology. As new generations of enabling technologies emerge, reshaping our business landscape, your strategic goal should be to cultivate an agile operation capable of swiftly adapting to change and unexpected challenges. DataMiner offers a technology-agnostic, cloud-enabled DevOps platform to monitor and orchestrate your business and technology automation workflows. The success of Digital Transformation relies heavily on the efficient utilization of this transformative technology to enhance your operations.

No one understands the intricacies of your operation better than the DevOps team responsible for its daily execution. Investing in training for your engineering team is a winning strategy, ensuring rapid results and generates significant value. With their deep understanding of the challenges, the local team can immediately put the acquired DataMiner tools to good use.
