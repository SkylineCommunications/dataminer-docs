# Does technical support apply to the actual DataMiner connectors I design?

No. Technical support does not include support on how to develop or troubleshoot your own DataMiner connectors. The latter is only available via pre-paid consultancy services, which can be purchased through the Skyline Sales department. Any such DataMiner [Professional Service credits](xref:Professional_service_credits) you purchase can be used on demand.
