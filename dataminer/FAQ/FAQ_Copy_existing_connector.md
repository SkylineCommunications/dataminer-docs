# Can I copy existing third-party DataMiner connectors or parts of them?

A DataMiner connector is the intellectual property of the owner of that DataMiner connector. A DataMiner connector that you have not designed yourself cannot be copied, neither entirely nor partially, with the intention to develop new DataMiner connectors, unless you have an explicit written agreement from the owner of the DataMiner connector to do so.
