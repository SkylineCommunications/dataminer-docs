# What is the standard lead time for new connectors?

DataMiner is guaranteed to integrate with any data source (device, system, software application, etc.) from any vendor independent of the protocol required, including both industry-standard protocols such as SNMP as well as full proprietary/vendor-specific protocols.

Today, more than 7000 different devices and systems from more than 1000 different vendors have been integrated in DataMiner. Current integrations include interfacing via physical interfaces such as Ethernet, RS232, synchronous and asynchronous RS485/RS422, GPIB, analog and digital contacts, using both standard (including but not limited to Modbus, SOAP, XML, APIs, CORBA, WMI, SQL, HTML, telnet, SSH, SNMP, REST, IS-OX, etc.) and full proprietary/vendor-specific protocols. Because of the large variation in integrations (e.g. type of protocols, number of read and write parameters on a specific type of device, etc.), and various external dependencies (e.g. availability of remote monitoring and control interface documentation, availability of a test and validation device, etc.), Skyline cannot unconditionally commit to a lead time to develop and deliver a new connector.

On average, across all integrations done in the past, the lead time for a new connector (including testing and validation) is about 6 to 9 weeks. However, because of the large variations in complexity, the lead time for individual connectors can also vary significantly (e.g. a simple device can be integrated in a few hours, while a very complex and comprehensive device can take several months).

> [!NOTE]
> This also depends on the timing of the purchase. Like any company, Skyline Communications has a finite development capacity, and the current state of our development pipeline will inevitably have an impact on the lead time. A timely purchase or planning will always help.
