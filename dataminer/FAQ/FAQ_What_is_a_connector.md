# What is a DataMiner connector?

The DataMiner platform uses DataMiner connectors to interact with third-party devices and systems, using any possible interface or protocol, including industry-standard protocols such as SNMP as well as full proprietary or vendor-specific protocols, for the purpose of monitoring and control.

## Who can develop DataMiner connectors?

DataMiner connectors use an open format and can be designed by anybody, including Skyline DevOps Engineers, DataMiner users, and DataMiner Strategic Partners.

## Do I need DIS to develop new DataMiner connectors?

DataMiner connectors are modelled in an open XML format, and can therefore be designed and edited using any XML-compatible editor. DIS is a purpose-built IDE (Integrated Development Environment) specifically tailored for developing and testing DataMiner connectors, and is one of the options available.

## Who owns a DataMiner connector?

A DataMiner connector is owned by its original developer, which can be Skyline Communications, a DataMiner user or a DataMiner Strategic Partner. Owners of a DataMiner connector decide under which terms and conditions their DataMiner connectors can be used by the owners of a DataMiner System.

## What is a signed DataMiner connector?

A signed DataMiner connector contains a so-called electronic signature, which protects the content of the DataMiner connector from being altered. The content of a signed DataMiner connector is visible to all its users. A valid signature guarantees that the DataMiner connector is the authentic and unaltered DataMiner connector as it was signed by the developer.

Signed DataMiner connectors are marked by a special icon displayed next to them in the Protocols & Templates UI of the DataMiner Cube client. We highly recommend only deploying signed DataMiner connectors in your DataMiner System. That way, you can be sure that the developer of each connector is known, and that the connector is the authentic, unaltered connector.

## What is an encrypted DataMiner connector?

An encrypted DataMiner connector is a DataMiner connector of which the content is encrypted, and therefore unreadable to any user. DataMiner connector encryption can be used to protect intellectual property of specific algorithms or proprietary communication protocols.

Encrypted DataMiner connectors are marked by a special icon displayed next to the DataMiner connector in the Protocols & Templates UI of the DataMiner Cube client.

## What is a first-, second- and third-party DataMiner connector?

A first-party DataMiner connector is a DataMiner connector developed by Skyline Communications.

A second-party DataMiner connector is a DataMiner connector developed by the owner of a DataMiner System.

A third-party DataMiner connector is a DataMiner connector developed by a DataMiner Strategic Partner, which could be a product vendor, a system integrator, a consultancy company, or a reseller.
