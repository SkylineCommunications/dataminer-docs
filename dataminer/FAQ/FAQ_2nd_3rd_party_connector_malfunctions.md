# What if a second- or third-party DataMiner connector malfunctions?

Skyline is not liable for the use of a second- or third-party DataMiner connector or the potential consequences of this. Whenever you deploy second- or third-party DataMiner connectors, we recommend that you make all necessary agreements with the provider of those DataMiner connectors regarding technical support and upgrades.

When Skyline Technical Support is requested to resolve issues of which the root cause is a second- or third-party DataMiner connector, then Skyline is entitled to bill the time it spent on identifying and resolving these issues to the requesting party.
