# What are the benefits of using clustered DataMiner Agents as opposed to separate ones?

When you have a non-clustered system, that means you have one or more separate DataMiner Agents. If you instead cluster several DataMiner Agents together into one DataMiner System, this brings multiple benefits.

- Every piece of functionality can be visualized as one. One system can, for example, present you with a dashboard that combines data collected from multiple DataMiner Agents.

- Capacity can be combined and utilized efficiently across the entire cluster.

- The DataMiner connectors on the individual DataMiner Agents are combined and made available across all Agents in the cluster, allowing these connectors to be used more efficiently.

- An end-to-end view on all services will improve service monitoring.

- End-to-end Correlation Engine and Automation Engine functionality (i.e. cross-system Automation and Correlation).

- Reports containing data from multiple Agents.

- Correlation rules based on alarms from multiple Agents.

- One-time setup of all your email notification filters.

- Administrative tasks only need to be performed once (e.g. setting up automated backups).

- Unified alarm templates and several admin level settings.

- Cross-system Advanced Analytics (e.g. cross-system behavioral analysis).

- Unified Mobile Gateway integration.

- Integration of ticketing platforms.

- Unified user and group permissions.
