# How many (concurrent) users can log in to a DataMiner System?

DataMiner comes without limitations in terms of total number of users or number of concurrent users, and there is no license fee associated with individual users.

In other words, because accessibility is an important asset of DataMiner, the solution includes unlimited web-based remote access to the system, ensuring that users can access the platform from any location, via the Cube desktop app or the browser on their client machine, smartphone, or tablet, at any time considered necessary and regardless of the number of concurrent users.

From a technical point of view, Skyline guarantees that at least 100 concurrent users can log on to a DataMiner System, independently of their profile (administrator, operator, etc.), performing custom user behavior (opening elements, services, views, requesting (history) alarms, trending, etc.).
