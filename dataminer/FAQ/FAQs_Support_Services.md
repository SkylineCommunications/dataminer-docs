# Questions related to DataMiner Support Services

## General

### What happens when my renewal of my support plan is overdue (perpetual-use plan only)?

By default, support plans renew automatically every year, unless they have been stopped by the user in advance of the end date of the plan.

### What happens if I do not have active support on a perpetual-licensed system?

- You do not have access to the Skyline IOC technical support team.
- Your platform is exposed to technical & security vulnerabilities.
- New purchased connectors added to your DataMiner platform are at risk of not being (fully) supported because an outdated DataMiner software version is in use.
- You have the option to get support for the DataMiner core and connectors (except for upgrades). This is charged as professional credit services.

Skyline will provide you with a renewal proposal for the support services at least three months prior to the end date of your support plan. Unless you provide Skyline with a written notice of your wish not to renew the support plan no later than thirty days prior to the end date of the plan, it is automatically renewed for another year, and Skyline will invoice the amount of the renewal proposal. All amounts due to Skyline are payable up front before the provision of any support services. If you terminate the support services early, this does not entitle you to a refund.

In case the support plan has not been deactivated, and you fail to pay your invoice(s) or issue a PO (if required) in time, on the day after the end date of the plan, the service may be stopped along with all related services linked to it. However, you can still continue to consult content and resources on the Dojo Community portal.

### Are there any limitations to the use of the professional service credits included with support renewals?

The service credits can be used for support or any of the available Professional Services offerings. These credits are subject to availability and need to be scheduled and spent within the present year. Non-used credits are not transferable to subsequent years.

### How is personal data handled?

If Skyline processes personal data on behalf of you in performing support services, these data will only be processed for the purpose of the support services. Skyline will take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing to prevent accidental loss, destruction, damage, alteration, or disclosure. Skyline may employ its employees, affiliates, and third parties worldwide in the performance of the support services, but it will always remain the primary responsible party for the handling of your data. This may involve a transfer of personal data outside of the European Economic Area if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:

- The personal data is transferred to a country that is recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection in relation to the data that is transferred.
- A processing agreement that incorporates the standard model contractual clauses for data transfers approved by the European Commission is executed between the applicable parties.

## Support fees

### Is there a difference in price between support plans?

No. Community, Continuity, and Evolve plans have different eligibility requirements.

### What's the price of support services during business hours and for the out-of-business hours add-on?

Perpetual-use licenses have an optional annual recurring fee for support services based on the value of the deployed licenses. The license value is determined by the license's original list price plus the subsequent APAs.

For usage-based services, support services during business hours are included with a subscription. See [Support Plans](xref:Overview_Support_Plans).

Regardless of the commercial model, the OBH add-on is available as a monthly or yearly subscription. The fee is determined by your organization’s yearly recurrent spend, calculated as the sum of support for perpetual licenses (before discounts) and your subscribed services. This fee covers the standby service, with an additional [hourly fee]( https://community.dataminer.services/service-credits/) for services performed outside of business hours. The fee is determined by your organization’s yearly recurrent spend.

### What is APA?

APA stands for Annual Price Adjustment. This is the automatic adjustment of sales prices reflecting current market conditions and actual cost evolutions.

### Why the APA?

Today, we live in a rapidly changing world causing unprecedentedly volatile times and a general global upwards trend in the cost of goods and services all around us. All organizations have to deal with this on a daily basis. As a result, the internal organizational costs are rising significantly, and to secure a long-term future several measures need to be taken. This is no different for Skyline Communications.

Just like any other professional organization today, we are forced to apply an Annual Price Adjustment (APA), charged as a percentage on top of the pricing of the year before. This covers the extra costs we are currently facing in the delivery of support services (such as inflation, among others). The APA is ***not*** an increase in Skyline Communications’ margin, and for the successor year the APA will be re-evaluated reflecting the inflation of that period and communicated to you in a timely manner.

### What defines the APA percentage?

The Annual Price Adjustment Percentage (APA%) is determined by reference to the official inflation rates of Belgium, as publicly available on websites such as [tradingeconomics.com](https://tradingeconomics.com/). The choice of Belgium as the relevant reference for this calculation is predicated on the significant volume of support services and the development of new software from Skyline's headquarters located in Belgium.

On an annual basis, Skyline's leadership team will assess the official inflation trends by considering the preceding six months' data metrics and by forecasting the trend for the subsequent six months. Subsequently, the APA% will be finalized and established as the new baseline for pricing in support renewals, encompassing the forthcoming period.

The revised APA% rate will be formally communicated and integrated into the support renewal process, commencing three months prior to the anniversary date of the users' ongoing support plan.

### What is the APA for the current year?

For the current value, refer to Skyline Communications’ quotation.

## Multi-year support renewals

### Are multi-year renewals possible?

Yes, the minimum renewal period is 1 year, and you can opt for a multi-year renewal for up to 3 years. which means placing an order covering the entire period’s value.

Multi-year renewals have two main benefits:

- Financial predictability: Locking the value paid today can amount to significant savings during that period, protecting against fluctuations and inflation rates.
- Convenience: This ensures continuous support without disruptions, avoiding the overhead of annual renewals.

### What's the APA for multi-year support renewals?

When you opt for a multi-year renewal, the APAs for the following years are locked at a predetermined rate.

### How are multi-year support renewals invoiced?

For an order to qualify as a multi-year order with the resulting benefits, the total value must be fully paid up front when the order is placed.
