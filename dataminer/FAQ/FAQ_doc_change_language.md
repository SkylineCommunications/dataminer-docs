# How can I view DataMiner documentation or learning materials in a different language?

Most browsers support automatic translation, so you can use this to get a translation for DataMiner content. However, note that while such automated translations will give you a very good idea of what the English text is about, they may not always be completely accurate.

For training videos, you can get translated subtitles as follows:

1. If subtitles are not yet enabled, click the cogwheel button at the bottom, click the > button next to *Subtitles/CC Off*, and select *English (auto-generated)*.

   ![Activate subtitles](~/dataminer/images/Change_language_video_subtitles1.png)

1. Once the subtitles have been enabled, click the same cogwheel button and > button, and select *Auto-translate*.

   ![Change language subtitles](~/dataminer/images/Change_language_video_subtitles.png)

Other translation features depend on your settings and on the browser you use. For example, if English is not set as a known language in Microsoft Edge, when you open the DataMiner documentation in Edge, you will be asked if you want to translate the page from English:

![Edge translation function](~/dataminer/images/Edge_translate_page.png)

If you do not get this pop-up message in Edge, go to your browser settings and make sure that English is not among your preferred languages and that *Offer to translate pages* is enabled.
