# Uploading an information template file

Instead of creating custom information templates in Cube, you can also create them in a third-party XML editor and upload them.

1. Make sure the name of the information template you want to upload starts with “*Information\_*”. For example, *Information_Microsoft_platform.xml*. This way, DataMiner will recognize it as an information template.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Once the template has been uploaded, its name automatically changes to *information.xml*.

1. Go to *Apps* > *Protocols & Templates*.

1. Under *Information Templates*, right-click a random information template and select *Upload*.

   Alternatively, you can click the *Upload* button in the lower-right corner of the card.

1. In the *Open* dialog box, select the file to be uploaded, and click *Open*.
