# Scheduling an alarm template

It is possible to schedule an alarm template so that it is only active at certain times. This way, you can for example make sure a particular alarm template is active on weekdays only.

To schedule an alarm template:

1. In the alarm template editor, click *Show details*, and then click the *Configure* button.

1. Select *Template is only active on*.

1. For every day or every separate time span on a day that you want to schedule, do the following:

   1. Click *Add schedule*.

   1. Select a day of the week and enter a time in the format HH:mm in the *begin* and *end* fields.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - When scheduling an alarm template, you cannot create overlapping time spans. If, for example, you were to set a time span on Friday from 08:00 to 12:00 and another on Friday from 11:00 to 15:00, a warning message would appear, and you would not be able to save the template. In case of this example, one time span should be created instead on Friday from 08:00 to 15:00.
> - If you select *Template is only active on* without specifying when it should be active, the template will always be disabled.
