# Changing the read status of an alarm

In DataMiner Cube, a new "unread" alarm record shows up in the Alarm Console in bold typeface. As soon as you select it for more than two seconds, it is considered "read" and subsequently loses its bold typeface.

The number of "unread" alarm records shown in a particular alarm tab is indicated in the label of that alarm tab, e.g. "Active alarms (55 new)".

To set a read alarm record back to "unread", right-click the alarm record and click *Set alarm as unread*.

> [!NOTE]
> The read/unread status of an alarm record is a user setting, which means that it is linked to your user account. As a result, read/unread statuses shown on your screen will differ from those shown on another userâ€™s screen.
