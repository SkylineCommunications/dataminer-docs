# Gaining insights using time-scoped relation learning

This tutorial showcases DataMiner's [time-scoped relation learning](xref:Adding_time_scoped_related_parameters_to_a_trend_graph) features. You will learn how to select a time range where a parameter seems to be misbehaving and how DataMiner automatically guides you to identify the root cause of the problem.

This tutorial will make use of [history sets](xref:How_to_use_history_sets_on_a_protocol_parameter) to establish the parameters' normal behavior, enabling DataMiner to detect unexpected behavior. Trending is enabled on all parameters used in this tutorial.

The content and screenshots for this tutorial have been created in DataMiner 10.4.0.

Estimated duration: 20 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- DataMiner 10.3.8 or higher with [Storage as a Service (STaaS)](xref:STaaS) (recommended) or a [self-managed Cassandra-compatible database and indexing database](xref:Supported_system_data_storage_architectures).

- Behavioral Anomaly Detection is enabled (in DataMiner Cube: *System Center* > *System settings* > *analytics config*).

- The [time to live](xref:Specifying_TTL_overrides) for trending is at least 1 day for real-time trending and 2 weeks for minute records.

## Overview

The tutorial consists of the following steps:

- [Step 1: Install the example package from the Catalog](#step-1-install-the-example-package-from-the-catalog)
- [Step 2: Discover anomaly detection in trend graphs](#step-2-discover-anomaly-detection-in-trend-graphs)
- [Step 3: Discover proactive cap detection](#step-3-discover-proactive-cap-detection)
- [Step 4: Find the root cause](#step-4-find-the-root-cause)
- [Step 5: Use time-scoped relation learning](#step-5-use-time-scoped-relation-learning)
- [Step 6: Final exercise](#step-6-final-exercise)

## Step 1: Install the example package from the Catalog

1. Go to <https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/66957152-fa95-46c1-9f82-9ed9ca542e42>.

1. Deploy the Catalog item to your DataMiner Agent by clicking the *Deploy* button.

   This will create a DataMiner element named "Relation Learning Tutorial - Kata Relation Learning" in your system, which will be used throughout the rest of the tutorial. The element will be located in the view *DataMiner Catalog* > *Augmented Operations* > *Relation Learning Tutorial*.

## Step 2: Discover anomaly detection in trend graphs

1. In DataMiner Cube, select the element *Relation Learning Tutorial - Kata Relation Learning* in the Surveyor.

   This element gives insights into the available physical memory of a fictional server and displays a *Task manager* table, showing the memory usage of various processes running on the server.

1. Click the *Generate Data* button to initiate the influx of historical trend data.

   Within approximately 10 seconds, you will observe substantial historical trend data being pushed through DataMiner, undergoing real-time analysis.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The protocols used in this tutorial can only load data for a parameter once. If you have made a mistake or want to retry an exercise, you can rerun the simulation by [duplicating](xref:Duplicating_elements) the element and generating the data again on the duplicated element.

1. Wait until the *Data Generated?* parameter displays *Yes*.

1. Click ![the trend icon](~/dataminer/images/trend_icon_unknown.png) next to the *Available Physical Memory* parameter.

1. Select *Month to date* from the options available in the top-right corner of the trending page to inspect the trend data for the past month.

   Initially, the available physical memory appears relatively stable. However, over the last 10 days, three anomalous events become apparent: a temporary decrease in memory (1), followed by a permanent decrease (2), and ultimately, a decreasing trend in the memory (3).

   ![Anomalous events](~/dataminer/images/Anomalous_Events.png)

   Under each of the behavioral changes, a gray block is displayed. These blocks indicate a detected change in behavior, or **change point**.

1. Hover the mouse pointer over a change point to see more detail about the type of change point (e.g. a level shift). If necessary, zoom in to see all details, such as the begin and end values of the change.

   > [!TIP]
   > For more information on the possible types of change points, see [Working with behavioral anomaly detection](xref:Working_with_behavioral_anomaly_detection)

## Step 3: Discover proactive cap detection

Although the main focus of this tutorial is relation learning, it is important to note the proactive cap detection functionality at play. As you can see in the trend data, the available physical memory parameter approaches a critical level of 0MB. However, DataMiner knows that a free memory parameter is not allowed to dip below zero and proactively alerts you to this behavior without requiring any configuration.
  
1. Click the light bulb icon in the top-right corner of the Alarm Console.

   This icon lights up in blue to indicate that DataMiner Analytics found something interesting. For more detailed info, see [Working with the Alarm Console light bulb feature](xref:Light_Bulb_Feature).

1. Click the menu item *1 alarm is predicted in the near future* (this can be a higher number if your system has detected anomalies on other elements).

   ![Alarms predicted](~/dataminer/images/Alarms_Near_Future.png)

    A new *Predicted alarms* tab will now be shown in the Alarm Console, listing the predicted issues.

1. Find the predicted alarm for the element *Relation Learning Tutorial - Kata Relation Learning*.

   In the *Value* column, you can find an estimate of when the system will reach the predicted minimum value of 0MB and is expected to run out of memory.

1. Double-click the predicted alarm to open the trend graph of that parameter.

## Step 4: Find the root cause

Now that you have identified the memory leak problem, it is time to address it.

1. Click *Up to Data Display* in the top-left corner of the *Available Physical Memory* trending page.

1. To find the process consuming the most memory, double-click *Memory Usage* in the *Task manager* table.

   The downward-facing arrow next to *Memory Usage* indicates that the column is sorted from highest to lowest. *MyStockController* emerges as the process using the most memory and appears to be the culprit.

1. Click ![the trend icon](~/dataminer/images/trend_icon_unknown.png) next to *MyStockController*.

1. Select *Week to date* from the options available in the top-right corner of the trending page to inspect the trend data for the past week.

   The *MyStockController* process started leaking memory approximately three days ago.

1. Compare this trend graph to the *Available Physical Memory* trend graph:

   1. Click the upward arrow in the lower-right corner of the trending page to open the parameter pane.

   1. Select *Add parameter* in the lower-left corner of the parameter pane.

   1. Change the parameter to *Available Physical Memory* and click *Show trend* in the lower-right corner of the parameter pane.

   > [!TIP]
   > See also: [Working with the parameter pane](xref:Working_with_the_parameter_pane)

   The decreasing trend observed in the *Available Physical Memory* trend graph started simultaneously with the onset of memory leakage in the *MyStockController* process. The root cause has been successfully identified.

## Step 5: Use time-scoped relation learning

Given the significant and ongoing nature of the memory leakage, identifying its root cause was fairly straightforward. Had the issue no longer been ongoing, the culpable process may not have revealed itself as the process currently consuming the most memory or, if the problem had been more subtle, pinpointing its root cause would have been considerably more challenging.

Finding the cause of the permanent decrease in available physical memory, which occurred approximately a week ago, could therefore prove more difficult.

1. Select *Up to Data Display* in the top-left corner of the trending page.

1. Click the trend icon next to *Available Physical Memory* to access the *Available Physical Memory* trending page.

1. Select *Month to date* from the options available in the top-right corner of the trending page to inspect the trend data for the past month.

1. Within the trend graph, select the section of the graph where the parameter exhibits a permanent drop by pressing Ctrl and dragging with the left mouse button at the same time.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you are unable to select a section of the graph, click the user icon in the Cube header, navigate to *Settings > Trending > Graph actions*, and verify the hotkey configured for alternate mouse button actions on a trend graph. See [Trending settings](xref:User_settings#trending-settings).

   Alternatively, you can select the gray block displayed under the behavioral change.

1. Click the light bulb icon.

   DataMiner suggests adding the memory usage of the Java runtime to the trend graph.

1. Select *Add 'Task manager: Memory Usage Java runtime' of 'Relation Learning Tutorial - Kata Relation Learning' to trend graph*.

   Thanks to DataMiner's assistance, you have again identified the culprit: the Java runtime began consuming more memory simultaneously with the *Available Physical Memory* decrease.

## Step 6: Final exercise

In this final step, you will apply everything you have learned earlier in a [practical exercise](https://community.dataminer.services/courses/kata-28/lessons/kata-28-upload-assignment/):

The *Available Physical Memory* parameter exhibits a temporary drop in memory (1).
