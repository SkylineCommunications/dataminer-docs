# Using trend patterns to detect backup failures

This tutorial illustrates DataMiner's [pattern matching](xref:Working_with_pattern_matching) feature in the context of Dashboards and Low-Code Apps. It will show you how to access patterns and occurrences within a dashboard and how to effectively handle missing pattern occurrences, using the example of server backups. By utilizing a trend pattern, DataMiner will detect the backups. The goal of the example dashboard in this tutorial is to generate a comprehensive report indicating whether daily backup patterns have been detected for all servers.

Estimated duration: 20 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A DataMiner System [connected to dataminer.services](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud).
- DataMiner 10.4.4 or higher with [Storage as a Service (STaaS)](xref:STaaS) (recommended) or a [self-managed Cassandra database with indexing](xref:Supported_system_data_storage_architectures).
- Pattern matching is enabled (in DataMiner Cube: *System Center* > *System settings* > *analytics config*).

## Overview

The tutorial consists of the following steps:

- [Step 1: Install the example package from the Catalog](#step-1-install-the-example-package-from-the-catalog)
- [Step 2: Compile a list of the most recent backup pattern occurrences per server](#step-2-compile-a-list-of-the-most-recent-backup-pattern-occurrences-per-server)
- [Step 3: Interpret the timestamp of every occurrence](#step-3-interpret-the-timestamp-of-every-occurrence)

## Step 1: Install the example package from the Catalog

1. Go to <https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/cc65fcf5-de87-4e3f-8209-fdd027928e56>.

1. Deploy the Catalog item to your DataMiner Agent by clicking the *Deploy* button.

   This will create a DataMiner element named *Kata - Server overview* in your system, which will be used throughout the rest of the tutorial. The element will be located in the view *Kata* > *Trend patterns in Dashboards and LCA*. This will also create a trend pattern and generate occurrences. This might take a couple of minutes.

1. In DataMiner Cube, check whether the element *Kata - Server overview* has been created before you continue to the next step.

## Step 2: Compile a list of the most recent backup pattern occurrences per server

1. [Create a new dashboard](xref:Creating_a_completely_new_dashboard).

1. Drag and drop the *Dropdown* visualization from the pane on the left to the top of the dashboard.

   ![Drop down visualizations](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_patterns_in_dashboards_add_dropdown.png)

   This component will allow users to select a specific trend pattern, which will be used in a query to retrieve the occurrences.

1. Drag and drop the *table* visualization from the pane on the left to the dashboard, below the dropdown component.

   ![Table visualizations](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_patterns_in_dashboards_add_table.png)

   This will add a table component. In this component, you will show the output of a GQI query.

1. Drag the edges of the table component to resize it until it takes up the width of your screen.

1. In the data pane, open the *QUERIES* section and click the "+" icon to create a new query.

   ![Add Query](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_patterns_in_dashboards_add_query.png)

1. Name the new query `Patterns`.

1. Configure the query as follows:

   1. Select the *Get trend data patterns* data source.

   1. Add a *Select* operator and make sure to have both *Pattern name* and *Pattern ID* selected.

      ![Select](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_patterns_in_dashboards_query_patterns.png)

1. Drag the query to the dropdown component at the top of the dashboard.

   This will link the component to the query, allowing the user to select any of the patterns in the system.

1. In the dropdown component, select the pattern *Kata backup*.

   This pattern has been added by the package you installed earlier.

1. Create another query and name it `Most recent pattern occurrences per server`.

1. Drag the query to the table component in order to link the component to this query.

1. Configure the query as follows:

   1. Select the *Get trend data pattern events* data source.

   1. Add a *Filter* operator and configure it as follows:

      - Column: *Pattern ID*.
      - Filter method: *Equals*
      - Value: Click the link icon in the value box, then select your Dropdown feed and the property *Pattern ID*, and click *Apply*.

        ![Filter Pattern ID](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_patterns_in_dashboards_filter_pattern.png)

1. Add an operator to extract the server name from the table key, so you will be able to use this as a column name:

   1. At the bottom of the query, select *Apply custom operator*, and then select *ParameterKeyToSeparateColumns*.

   1. In the *Parameter Key Column* box, select *Parameter ID*.

   ![ParameterKeyToSeparateColumns](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_patterns_in_dashboards_customop_Parameterkeytoseparatecolumns.png)

1. Add another custom operator to rename the *Table Index* column to *Server*.

   1. Select *Apply custom operator*, and then select *Rename column*.

   1. Select the column *Table Index* and specify the new name `Server`.

   ![Rename](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_patterns_in_dashboards_customop_renamecolumn.png)

1. Configure the query so that the most recent pattern occurrences per server will be retrieved:

   1. Add another custom operator to transform the values from the *Start time* field from DateTime to double format:

      1. Select *Apply custom operator*, and then select *DateTimeToDouble*.

      1. Select the DateTime column *Start time*.

      This transformation is necessary to be able to do an aggregate operation on the *Start time* column, as the Aggregate operator does not support DateTime columns yet.

   1. Add an *Aggregate* operator to get the most recent pattern occurrence per server:

      - Column: *Start time (as double)*
      - Method: *Maximum*

   1. Add a *Group by* operator, selecting the column *Server*.

   1. Add the *DoubleToDateTime* custom operator to transform the result back to DateTime format.

   Your query should now look like this:

   ![Rename](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_patterns_in_dashboards_aggregate.png)

1. Add another *Rename column* custom operator to rename the aggregated result column to `Most recent pattern occurrence`.

    ![Rename](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_patterns_in_dashboards_customop_renamecolumn2.png)

## Step 3: Interpret the timestamp of every occurrence

Now that you have retrieved the most recent pattern occurrence per server, you can use a custom operator to make a judgment based on those timestamps. A custom operator provides a lot of flexibility, allowing you to code pretty much whatever you want. In this case, the custom operator *DateIsOlderThan* will be used, which is available in the Catalog and was also included in the package you installed earlier. It adds a column indicating if the date is older than a given number of days.

1. At the bottom of the *Most recent pattern occurrences per server* query, add the *DateIsOlderThan* custom operator, with the following configuration:

   - Date Time Column: *Most recent pattern occurrence*
   - Number of days: *1*

   ![DateTimeIsOlderThan](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_patterns_in_dashboards_customop_DateTimeIsOlderThan.png)

1. Use the [Template editor](xref:Template_Editor) to configure a validation icon/color for the *Most recent pattern occurrence* column:

   1. Select the table, go to *Layout* > *Column appearance*, and select the *Most recent pattern occurrence* column.

   1. Below this, select *Left*.

   1. On the right side of box where you have selected the column, select ... > *Customize preset* to open the template editor.

      ![Customize preset](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_patterns_in_dashboards_customize_preset.png)

   1. In the template editor, go to the *Tools* tab, select *Icon*, and drag the mouse pointer on the left side of the work area to draw the icon layer.

      While the icon is selected, you can use the *Dimensions* boxes on the right to resize and reposition it exactly the way you want.

   1. Select the text layer, and adjust the right margin via the lower-left *Dimensions* box on the right, so that the text is displayed next to the icon.

   1. Add a condition to the icon layer for when the validation is OK:

      1. Click *+ Add case*.

      1. Click *When condition*, select *Validation*, and specify the filter `Yes`.

      1. Select *Show icon*, set the color to green (e.g. *#85A864*) and the icon to a check mark.

         When you select the icon, you can use the filter box to quickly find a specific icon.

   1. Add another condition to the icon layer for when the validation returns invalid:

      1. Click *+ Add case*.

      1. Click *When condition*, select *Validation*, and specify the filter `No`.

      1. Select *Show icon*, set the color to red (e.g. *#FF0000*) and the icon to an "error" exclamation mark.

   1. Similarly, add conditions to the text layer that will turn the text color to green or red depending on the validation.

   ![Template](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_patterns_in_dashboards_template.png)

   > [!TIP]
   > See also: [Template editor](xref:Template_Editor).

1. Hide the columns in the table that no longer need to be shown:

   1. In the *data* pane, make sure you are no longer editing the *Most recent pattern occurrences* query, and expand the query so you can see the columns it contains.

   1. Drag and drop the columns *Server* and *Most recent pattern occurrence* to the table component, so that these are added as a filter.

   ![Template](~/dataminer/images/Tutorial_patterns_in_column_filter.png)

The resulting dashboard could for instance look like this:
