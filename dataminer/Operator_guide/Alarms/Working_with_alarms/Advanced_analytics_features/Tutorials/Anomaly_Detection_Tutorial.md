# Detecting anomalies with DataMiner

This tutorial illustrates DataMiner's [Behavioral Anomaly Detection](xref:Working_with_behavioral_anomaly_detection) features and shows how you can use these to detect certain failures in your operation.

By default, behavioral anomaly detection is active on trended parameters. It will monitor the parameters in real time and notify users about any detected anomalies. The feature models the behavior of a parameter based on its recent history. The tutorial will make use of [history sets](xref:How_to_use_history_sets_on_a_protocol_parameter) to quickly simulate a parameter with historical trend data. Trending is activated by default on the parameters used in this tutorial.

Estimated duration: 45 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- DataMiner 10.3.12 or higher with [Storage as a Service (STaaS)](xref:STaaS) (recommended) or a [self-managed Cassandra database](xref:Supported_system_data_storage_architectures).

- A DataMiner System [connected to dataminer.services](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud).

- Behavioral Anomaly Detection is enabled (in DataMiner Cube: *System Center* > *System settings* > *analytics config*).

- The [time to live](xref:Specifying_TTL_overrides) for trending is at least 1 day for real-time trending and 1 month for minute records.

## Overview

The tutorial consists of the following steps:

- [Step 1: Install the example package from the Catalog](#step-1-install-the-example-package-from-the-catalog)
- [Step 2: Discover anomaly detection in trend graphs](#step-2-discover-anomaly-detection-in-trend-graphs)
- [Step 3: Discover anomaly detection in the Alarm Console](#step-3-discover-anomaly-detection-in-the-alarm-console)
- [Step 4: Make DataMiner generate alarms for anomalies](#step-4-make-dataminer-generate-alarms-for-anomalies)
- [Step 5: Make DataMiner generate alarms for specific anomaly types](#step-5-make-dataminer-generate-alarms-for-specific-anomaly-types)
- [Step 6: Set custom alarm thresholds](#step-6-set-custom-alarm-thresholds)
- [Step 7: Final exercise](#step-7-final-exercise)

## Step 1: Install the example package from the Catalog

1. Go to <https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/2f6e8d4c-8146-40fb-a2c6-6a22f76bcd19>.

1. Deploy the Catalog item to your DataMiner Agent by clicking the *Deploy* button.

   This will create several DataMiner elements in your system that will be used throughout the rest of the tutorial. The elements will be located in the view *DataMiner Catalog* > *Augmented Operations* > *Anomaly Detection Tutorial*.

## Step 2: Discover anomaly detection in trend graphs

1. In DataMiner Cube, select the element *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Audio bit rate* in the Surveyor.

   This element simulates a parameter monitoring the bit rate of an audio channel on an encoder.

1. Click the *Generate Data* button to generate data for the parameter *Audio Bit Rate Channel 1*.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The protocols used in this tutorial can only load data for a parameter once. If you have made a mistake or want to retry an exercise, you can rerun the simulation by [duplicating](xref:Duplicating_elements) the element and generating the data again on the duplicated element.

1. Wait until the *Data Generated?* parameter displays *Yes*.

1. Click the trend icon ![the trend icon](~/dataminer/images/trend_icon_unknown.png) next to the *Audio Bit Rate Channel 1* parameter.

1. Click *Month to date* to see data for the past month.

   You will see that the bitrate first remained stable around 96 kBps for the better part of two weeks before temporarily jumping up a few times to values around 256 kBps. Finally, after 5 jumps, there is one jump to over 1000 kBps.

   ![Audio bit rate with several jumps, some of which are marked as anomalous](~/dataminer/images/Audio_bit_rate.gif)

   Under each of the jumps up and down, a gray or black block is displayed. These blocks indicate a detected change in behavior, or **change point**.

   > [!TIP]
   > For more information on the possible types of change points, see [Working with behavioral anomaly detection](xref:Working_with_behavioral_anomaly_detection)

1. Hover the mouse pointer over a change point to see more detail about the type of change point (e.g. a level shift). If necessary, zoom in to see all details, such as the begin and end values.

   ![Zoomed in view of a change point to see all details](~/dataminer/images/Audio_Bit_Rate_Trending_ChangePoint_Details.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > In the example, the blocks under the first two jumps have a darker color, because these are considered to be an anomaly. This is because when the first jump occurs, the parameter has never had similar behavior before. By the third jump, the algorithm has seen sufficient similar behavior to no longer consider the behavior anomalous. However, the jump towards the end is again considered anomalous, as it is much bigger than the previous ones.

## Step 3: Discover anomaly detection in the Alarm Console

1. In DataMiner Cube, select the element *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Encryption Key Requests* in the Surveyor.

   This element simulates a parameter monitoring the number of encryption key requests received per minute by a CAS server.
  
1. Click the *Generate Data* button to generate data for the parameter *Encryption Key Requests*.

1. Wait until the *Data Generated?* parameter displays *Yes*.

1. Click the light bulb icon in the top-right corner of the Alarm Console.

   This icon lights up in blue to indicate that DataMiner Analytics found something interesting. For more detailed info, see [Working with the Alarm Console light bulb feature](xref:Light_Bulb_Feature).

1. Click the menu item *2 anomalies were found in your trend data* (this can also be a a higher number if your system has detected anomalies on other elements).

   A new *Anomalies* tab will now be shown in the Alarm Console, listing the detected anomalies.

   ![Anomaly tab in the Alarm Console](~/dataminer/images/Encryption_Key_Requests_Lightbulb.gif)

1. Double-click one of the listed anomalies for the element *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Encryption Key Requests* to view the trend graph of the parameter.

   The trend graph will show that the number of requests per minute remained relatively stable for a long time but suddenly increased spectacularly a few hours ago, indicating that unexpected activity may be going on in the network.

   ![The trend graph of the 'Encryption Key Requests' parameter showing the anomalous region](~/dataminer/images/Encryption_Key_Requests_Trend_Graph.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You can also find the anomalies using the *Suggestion events* tab. To do so, click the plus icon in the header of the Alarm Console, and then select *Show current* > *Suggestion events*. This will open a tab with all suggestion events, including the two anomalies on *Encryption Key Requests*. However, this tab page can show more than only the anomalies. See [Advanced analytics features in the Alarm Console](xref:Advanced_analytics_features_in_the_Alarm_Console) for more information.

## Step 4: Make DataMiner generate alarms for anomalies

As anomalies might flag potential problems in your operation, it can be useful to show alarms for these events.

1. Create an alarm template for the example element *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Encryption Key Requests 2*:

   1. Right-click the element *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Encryption Key Requests 2* in the Surveyor, and select *Protocols & Templates* > *Assign alarm templates* > *New alarm template*.

      > [!NOTE]
      > This element is a copy of *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Encryption Key Requests*, which generates the same data.

   1. Specify a name for the alarm template, e.g. *Monitoring of anomalies*, and click *OK*.

   1. Select the checkbox in the *MON* column for the parameter *Encryption Key Requests*.

      This will enable alarm monitoring for this parameter.

   1. Scroll to the far right of the alarm template to find the *ANOMALIES* column.

      This column contains a button showing whether alarm monitoring for anomalies is currently enabled. By default, it will show *Disabled*.

   1. Click the button in the *ANOMALIES* column.

      This will open a new pop-up window where you can configure alarm monitoring for anomalies.

   1. In the dropdown box at the top, which by default shows *All disabled*, select *All smart*.

   1. Click *Close* to close the window.

   1. Click *OK* to save the alarm template.

      ![Anomaly alarm settings in DataMiner 10.3.12](~/dataminer/images/Anomaly_Alarming_Popup_All_Smart.gif)

      You have now enabled alarm monitoring for all types of anomalies detected on the parameter *Encryption Key Requests*. This means that anomalies that would previously be shown in the *Suggestion events* tab will now be shown in the *Active alarms* tab.

1. Simulate the data so that anomalies are detected:

   1. In DataMiner Cube, select the element *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Encryption Key Requests 2* in the Surveyor.

   1. Click the *Generate Data* button to generate data for the parameter *Encryption Key Requests*.

   1. Wait until the *Data Generated?* parameter displays *Yes*.

1. In the Alarm Console, check the *Active alarms* tab.

   ![Anomalies generated by "Encryption Key Requests 2" in the Active alarms tab](~/dataminer/images/Encryption_Key_Requests_Active_Alarms.gif)

   Two anomalies marked as critical will be displayed in the *Active alarms* tab. This severity is determined by how severe DataMiner considers the anomaly to be. Larger jumps will for instance be considered more severe than lower jumps. Note that the *Anomalies* tab, which you can open via the light bulb icon, still contains these events, while the *Suggestion events* tab now does not.

1. Double click one of the anomaly alarms to inspect the trend data.

   Note that the anomalies are now indicated in red at the bottom of the trend graph, corresponding to the critical severity of the alarm that was generated.

   ![Trend graph of the "Encryption Key Requests" parameter showing the anomalous region in red](~/dataminer/images/Encryption_Key_Requests_Trend_Graph_Alarms.gif)

## Step 5: Make DataMiner generate alarms for specific anomaly types

In some cases, it can be useful to only generate alarms for certain types of anomalies, for example the bit rate parameter from step 2 above. The jumps between different encoding bit rates might be expected, depending on the stream that gets encoded at that time, but you might want to get notified if the bit rate starts fluctuating a lot on a certain stream (e.g. because it is being encoded using a variable bit rate scheme instead of a constant bit rate scheme). You can do this by activating alarm monitoring for *variance changes* only:

1. Create an alarm template:

   1. Right-click the element *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Audio bit rate (CBR-VBR)* in the Surveyor, and select *Protocols & Templates* > *Assign alarm templates* > *New alarm template*.

   1. Specify a name for the alarm template, e.g. *Variance change monitoring*, and click *OK*.

   1. Select the checkbox in the *MON* column for the parameter *Audio Bit Rate Channel 1*.

   1. Scroll to the far right of the alarm template to find the *ANOMALIES* column.

   1. Click the button in the *ANOMALIES* column.

   1. In the pop-up window, select *Variance increase* and *Variance decrease*.

      ![Configure monitoring of variance increases and decreases](~/dataminer/images/Anomaly_Alarming_Popup_Variance_Changes.gif)

   1. Click *Close* to close the window.

   1. Click *OK* to save the alarm template.

1. Simulate the data so that anomalies are detected:

   1. Select the element *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Audio bit rate (CBR-VBR)* in the Surveyor.

   1. Click the *Generate Data* button to generate data for the parameter *Audio Bit Rate Channel 1*.

   1. Wait until the *Data Generated?* parameter displays *Yes*.

1. In the Alarm Console, check the *Active alarms* tab.

   A *variance increase* alarm will show up in this tab.

   ![Variance increase on "Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Audio bit rate (CBR-VBR)" in the Active alarms tab](~/dataminer/images/Audio_Bit_Rate_CBR_Alarm_Console_Variance_Increase.png)

1. Double-click the alarm.

   You will see that the alarm indeed corresponds to a region with a much higher fluctuation in bit rate than normal. Note that the other anomalies that are detected on the parameter only show up in the *Suggestion events* tab and not in the *Active alarms* tab.

   ![Trend graph of the "Audio Bit Rate Channel 1" parameter](~/dataminer/images/Audio_Bit_Rate_CBR_Trending_Variance_Increase.png)

> [!TIP]
> It would be very difficult to configure similar alarm monitoring behavior using static alarm thresholds. This shows the power of anomaly alarm monitoring for detecting sudden unexpected behavior. For a complete list of all options related to alarm monitoring of anomalies, see [Configuring Augmented Operations alarm settings](xref:Configuring_anomaly_detection_alarms).

## Step 6: Set custom alarm thresholds

In the previous steps, DataMiner determined autonomously whether certain behavior was considered anomalous or not. However, sometimes it can be handy to add some more configuration to give DataMiner more input. In this example, you will configure specific thresholds for alarm monitoring of *level shift* anomalies.

1. Check the current behavior with the example element *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Cable Modems Out of Service*:

   1. Select the element in the Surveyor.

   1. Click the *Generate Data* button to generate data for the parameter *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Cable Modems Out of Service*.

   1. Wait until the *Data Generated?* parameter displays *Yes*.

   1. Click the trend icon ![the trend icon](~/dataminer/images/trend_icon_unknown.png) next to the parameter.

      ![Trend graph example without additional configuration](~/dataminer/images/CMOOS_Trend_Graph_No_Alarming.png)

      As you can see, the data tends to follow a wave pattern with a low number of cable modems out of service during the day, and a high number at night. This is caused by a significant number of people turning off their cable modem at night, making the CMTS unable to connect to it. Moreover, in the last two days, you can see four periods where more modems were out of service than expected: the data suddenly jumps up with around 70 units before dropping again a few hours later. Unfortunately, DataMiner only detects the first and the third period as anomalous, as seen by the dark grey blocks in the trend graph. This is because DataMiner assumes too quickly that the observed behavior is not anomalous since it has seen it before.

1. Configure level shift anomaly alarm detection for the element *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Cable Modems Out of Service 2*, so that alarms are generated during all four periods of anomalous behavior:

   1. Right-click the element *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Cable Modems Out of Service 2* in the Surveyor, and select *Protocols & Templates* > *Assign alarm templates* > *New alarm template*.

      > [!NOTE]
      > This element is a copy of *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Cable Modems Out of Service*, which generates the same data.

   1. Specify a name for the alarm template, e.g. *Monitoring of absolute thresholds*, and click *OK*.

   1. Select the checkbox in the *MON* column for the parameter *Cable Modems Out of Service*.

   1. Scroll to the far right of the alarm template to find the *ANOMALIES* column.

   1. Click the button in the *ANOMALIES* column.

   1. In the pop-up window, select *Level increases*.

   1. Next to *Level increases*, select *Absolute*.

   1. In the yellow box (i.e. major severity), fill in *50*.

      ![Configure alarm monitoring of level increases of size 50 or higher](~/dataminer/images/Anomaly_Alarming_Popup_Level_Increase_50.gif)

   1. Click *Close* to close the window.

   1. Click *OK* to save the alarm template.

1. Generate data for the element *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Cable Modems Out of Service 2*:

   1. Select the element in the Surveyor.

   1. Click the *Generate Data* button to generate data for the parameter *Cable Modems Out of Service*.

   1. Wait until the *Data Generated?* parameter displays *Yes*.

   1. Click the trend icon ![the trend icon](~/dataminer/images/trend_icon_unknown.png) next to the parameter.

      You will see that now a major alarm was generated for all four upward jumps.

      ![Trend graph of 'Cable Modems Out of Service' with absolute thresholds configured for level shifts](~/dataminer/images/CMOOS_Trend_Graph_With_Absolute_Alarming.png)

      While this is already a great improvement, the third major alarm could be considered less severe than the other three, as a lot of other cable modems are already offline when the jump happens. When you hover the mouse pointer over the change point, you will see that the parameter jumps from around 300 to around 385 at that point, representing an increase of around 28%, while the first, second, and fourth jump represent increases of around 38%, 35%, and 33%, respectively. This means that the alarm monitoring could be further refined, so that only a minor alarm is generated for the third jump.

      ![Details of the third level shift, a jump from 301 to 386 units](~/dataminer/images/CMOOS_Trend_Graph_Details_Third_Level_Shift.png)

1. Configure *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Cable Modems Out of Service 3* with relative alarm thresholds for more refined monitoring:

   1. Right-click the element *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Cable Modems Out of Service 3* in the Surveyor, and select *Protocols & Templates* > *Assign alarm templates* >  *New alarm template*.

   1. Specify a name for the alarm template, e.g. *Monitoring of relative thresholds*, and click *OK*.

   1. Select the checkbox in the *MON* column for the parameter *Cable Modems Out of Service*.

   1. Scroll to the far right of the alarm template to find the *ANOMALIES* column.

   1. Click the button in the *ANOMALIES* column.

   1. In the pop-up window, select *Level increases*.

   1. Next to *Level increases*, select *Relative*.

   1. Fill in *25* in the light-blue box (i.e. minor severity) and *30* in the yellow box (i.e. major severity).

      ![Configure alarm monitoring of level increases using relative thresholds](~/dataminer/images/Anomaly_Alarming_Popup_Level_Increase_Relative.gif)

   1. Click *Close* to close the window.

   1. Click *OK* to save the alarm template.

1. Generate data for the element *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Cable Modems Out of Service 3*:

   1. Select the element in the Surveyor.

   1. Click the *Generate Data* button to generate data for the parameter *Cable Modems Out of Service*.

   1. Wait until the *Data Generated?* parameter displays *Yes*.

   1. Click the trend icon ![the trend icon](~/dataminer/images/trend_icon_unknown.png) next to the parameter.

      You should now indeed see major alarms for the first, second, and fourth jump, and a minor alarm for the third jump.

      ![Trend graph of 'Cable Modems Out of Service' with relative thresholds configured for level shifts](~/dataminer/images/CMOOS_Trend_Graph_With_Relative_Alarming.png)

> [!TIP]
> In exactly the same way, you can configure alarm monitoring of *outlier* anomalies. See [Configuring Augmented Operations alarm settings](xref:Configuring_anomaly_detection_alarms).

## Step 7: Final exercise

In this final step, you will apply everything you have learned earlier in a practical exercise:

- Use the element *Anomaly Detection Tutorial - Signal Strength*. This element contains a parameter representing the strength of a signal received by a satellite dish.

- Configure an alarm template for this element so that alarms are generated when something goes wrong. You will need to make sure that not too many alarms get created.

Here is a screenshot of what the trend graph for the *Signal Strength* parameter should look like when everything has been configured correctly:

![Trend graph of "Signal strength" with the required alarms](~/dataminer/images/Signal_Strength_Goal.png)

You can see the following notable things in the data illustrated above:

- A period of about a week with higher fluctuations than normal (starting at October 11th).
- Three short drops (on October 24th, October 25th, and October 29th).
- Two longer drops (on October 25th).

Based on what you have learned in the previous steps, you should now configure the alarm template so that the following alarms are generated:

- A *major* alarm for all three shorter drops.
- A *critical* alarm for both longer drops.
- A *critical* alarm at the start of the period with higher fluctuations.

Make sure that no extra alarms are generated, for example for the following things:

- The moment the higher fluctuations stop.
- Any other drops than indicated above.

Remember that you can always duplicate the element to try a second time, if you have not yet reached optimal results on a first attempt.
