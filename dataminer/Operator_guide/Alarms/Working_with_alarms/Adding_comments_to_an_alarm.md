# Adding comments to an alarm

At all times, you can add comments to alarm records in DataMiner Cube to communicate useful information to other users.

To do so:

1. Right-click the alarm in the Alarm Console, and select *Add comment*.

1. Enter the comment in the dialog box and click *Add comment*.

When you add a comment to an alarm, a new alarm record is created with *Alarm Type* set to “Comment Added”. The comment itself is stored in the *Comment* field (along with your username and the timestamp).

There are several ways you can view comments on an alarm:

- Right-click the alarm in the Alarm Console, and select *View comment*.

- Add the column *Comment* to the Alarm Console. See [Changing the column layout in an alarm tab](xref:ChangingTheAlarmConsoleLayout#changing-the-column-layout-in-an-alarm-tab).

- Open the alarm card to read the comments at the bottom of the *details* pane. See [Alarm cards](xref:Alarm_cards).

> [!NOTE]
> It is not possible to add comments to alarms that have already been cleared. However, you can still view any existing comments on such alarms.
