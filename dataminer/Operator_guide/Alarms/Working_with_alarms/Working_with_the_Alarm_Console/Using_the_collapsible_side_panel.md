# Using the collapsible side panel of the Alarm Console

For each alarm tab, you can open a side panel in the Alarm Console showing the real-time value and history of a selected alarm.

You can open the side panel of an alarm tab in three ways:

- Right-click an alarm, and select *Show side panel*.

- Select *Show side panel* in the Alarm Console settings menu. See [Alarm Console settings](xref:AlarmConsoleSettings).

- Double-click an alarm in an alarm tab, if the *Alarm double-click action* user setting is set to *Open side panel*. See [Alarm Console settings](xref:User_settings#alarm-console-settings).

In the side panel:

- The top section contains the name of the element in alarm and an overview of its alarm state in the last twenty-four hours (1). Click this section to open the element card.

- Below this is the parameter section, which contains the current value of the parameter and an overview of the parameter state in the last twenty-four hours (2). If the parameter in alarm is trended, click this section to see the trend graph.

- The bottom section displays more information about the alarms in the alarm tree (3). Click any of the items in the tree to open the alarm card with the selected item highlighted. See [Alarm cards](xref:Alarm_cards).

You can hide the side panel in three ways:

- Right-click an alarm, and select *Hide side panel*.

- Clear the selection from *Show side panel* in the Alarm Console settings menu. See [Alarm Console settings](xref:AlarmConsoleSettings).

- Double-click an alarm in the alarm tab, if the *Alarm double-click action* user setting is set to *Open side panel*. See [Alarm Console settings](xref:User_settings#alarm-console-settings).

> [!NOTE]
> The setting that controls whether the side panel is shown or hidden is a tab setting. This means that you can show the side panel in one tab and hide it in another. It is also a user setting that is remembered across sessions.
