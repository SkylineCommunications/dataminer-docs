# Using the Alarm Console quick filter buttons

It is possible to quickly filter an Alarm Console tab so that only alarms of a certain severity are shown.

To do so, click the button indicating the relevant severity in the alarm bar.

When the filter is applied, the alarm tab is displayed with a blue background to indicate that it is being filtered. The total number of alarms is still indicated in the alarm bar, but the number of filtered alarms that are being displayed is added in parentheses.

To quickly clear the filter again, click the leftmost field of the alarm bar, indicating the total number of alarms in the tab.

> [!NOTE]
> The UI of the Alarm Console adapts to the available space on the screen. If there is sufficient room, the different severity levels shown on the alarm tab will be written in full, with an indication of how many alarms have this severity level. If there is less space, only the severity color and the number of alarms with this severity will be displayed. In very narrow windows, a single button will be displayed, which opens a menu with the different severity levels that can be used for filtering.
