# Working with trend groups

Trend information associated with groups of parameters can be displayed in so-called trend groups.

Trend groups are created and managed with the side and bottom panes in the Trending window:

![Trend groups](~/dataminer/images/Trend_Groups.png)<br>*Trending in DataMiner 10.4.5*

- In the **trend groups pane** on the left-hand side (1), the available trend groups can be viewed, and trend groups can be added or deleted. See [Working with the trend groups pane](xref:Working_with_the_trend_groups_pane).

- In the **parameter pane** at the bottom (2), parameters can be added to or removed from a trend group. See [Working with the parameter pane](xref:Working_with_the_parameter_pane).

By default, these panes are collapsed. You can expand them with the expand button.
