# Displaying alarm template colors in trend graphs

In the user settings, you can configure the way alarm severity levels are shown in trend graphs.

To make trend graphs show alarm template colors:

1. Go to *Settings \> Trending*.

1. Select the user setting *Show alarm template colors on vertical axis*.

By default, the colors will then be displayed in a colored line along the Y-axis. Alternatively, colored bands can be shown behind the trend graph instead.

To switch between these settings:

1. Go to *Settings \> Trending*.

1. In the drop-down list next to *Display the alarm template in the trend graph*, select either *Line* or *Band*.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The alarm template cannot be displayed in a trend graph if it uses a variable baseline.
> - An alarm timeline can also be displayed along the X-axis, indicating the severity at each point in time. However, this is only displayed on a parameter card, not in the Trending module or on a view card, and only as long as the initial parameter is displayed.
