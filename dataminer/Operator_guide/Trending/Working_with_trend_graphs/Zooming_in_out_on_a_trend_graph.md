# Zooming in/out on a trend graph

You can zoom in and out on graphs in several ways:

- On the main trend graph, drag while keeping the left mouse button clicked, or use the mouse scroll wheel.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In the user settings, this default behavior can be modified, so that, for example, the left mouse button can be used to pan instead. See [Trending settings](xref:User_settings#trending-settings).

- On the main trend graph, use the “+” and “-” keys on the keyboard to zoom in and out.

- Reset the starting point or the ending point of the main graph by dragging the boundaries in the bottom graph to the left or to the right.

- Right-click the graph and select **Last hour/Last 24 hours/Week to date/Month to Date/Year to date**.

> [!NOTE]
> - When you zoom in on a graph, more detail is added to the graph up to a maximum level. This level depends on the configuration, in particular on whether real-time trending is enabled or not.
