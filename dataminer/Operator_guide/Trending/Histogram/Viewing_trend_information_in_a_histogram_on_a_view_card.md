# Viewing trend information in a histogram on a view card

On the *HISTOGRAM* page of a view card, you can select a parameter to view its trend information in a histogram. It is also possible to save and load presets for a histogram

To view a parameter in a histogram, across the different elements in a view:

1. On the *HISTOGRAM* page of a view card, select a protocol, a protocol version, and a parameter. In case of a table parameter, you should also specify an index.

    Alternatively, you can also drag an element from the Surveyor onto the graph area to immediately select the protocol of that element

1. Click *Load Histogram*.

1. Optionally, in the *Advanced* section at the bottom, you can specify a custom *Interval width* and value range (*Minimum value* and *Maximum value*), and click *Apply*.

To save your selections as a preset:

1. Expand the *Presets* pane on the left side of the window and click the *Add preset* button

1. In the *Add preset* window, indicate the preset type: *Private*, *Protected* or *Public*.

1. Enter a name and optionally a description for the preset, and click the *Add preset* button at the bottom of the window.

1. Configure the histogram in the pane at the bottom and click the *Save* button in the lower-right corner.

    The preset will be available in the list of presets in the *Presets* pane on all view cards. Just click on the preset on any histogram page to load it again.

To delete a preset:

1. Click the preset in the *Presets* pane in order to select it.

1. Click the *Delete* button, and then click *Yes* in the confirmation window.
