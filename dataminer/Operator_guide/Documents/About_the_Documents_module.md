# About the Documents module

The *Documents* module allows you to integrate documents in DataMiner. This way, you can access relevant information about the elements and services in your system at any time.

There are two ways to access documents in DataMiner:

- Go directly to the module itself, by going to *Apps* > *Documents*.

- Go to the *Documents* page of an element or service card.

In addition, you can also search for a particular document using the Cube search functionality. For more information, see [Searching in DataMiner Cube](xref:Searching_in_DataMiner_Cube).

The following information can be stored with the app:

- Any file in any format: PDF, DOCX, XLSX, VSDX, etc.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Client computers will not be able to open the file if they have no program capable of reading the fileâ€™s format.

- Email addresses

- Hyperlinks to web pages
