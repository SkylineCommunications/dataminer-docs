# Embedding a Profile Manager component

For systems with the appropriate licenses, it is possible to embed a Profile Manager component in Visio. With this component, you can essentially embed the *Profiles* module in Visio.

To do so:

1. Add the shape that should contain the Profile Manager component.

1. Add the following shape data to the shape:

   | Shape data field | Value |
   |------------------|-------|
   | Component        | *ProfileManager*<br> or <br> *Profiles* |

1. To further refine the component, optionally add the following shape data fields to the component shape:

   - **ComponentOptions**: Allows you to specify whether you want the component to show the *definitions*, *instances* and/or *parameters* tabs.

     For example, to show only the *definitions* tab, configure the following value:

     `ShowDefinitions=True|ShowInstances=False|ShowParameters=False`

   - **Profile**: Allows you to specify the GUID of one particular profile instance that has to be displayed in the *Instances* tab, together with any parent and child items.
