# Linking a shape to a resource

From DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.10 onwards, it is possible to link an **Element** shape to the last-known resource using that element.

1. Link the shape to an element. See [Basic shape data field configuration](xref:Linking_a_shape_to_an_element_a_service_or_a_redundancy_group#basic-shape-data-field-configuration).

1. Add an **Options** shape data field and set its value to *UseResource=True*.

   | Shape data field   | Value            |
   |--------------------|------------------|
   | Options            | UseResource=True |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Within a service instance connectivity chain, the elements will automatically be linked to the resource.
> - Children of an element shape that has the *UseResource* option specified will automatically inherit this setting unless it is overridden.
> - You can use any of the placeholders listed for virtual function resources under [Making a shape display information about the item it is linked to](xref:Making_a_shape_display_information_about_the_item_it_is_linked_to). However, note that *\[Element Name\]* will only refer to the name of the resourceâ€™s virtual function element if this element can be found. Otherwise, it will refer to the name of the element that the shape is linked to. *\[Name\]* will always refer to the name of the element that the shape is linked to.
