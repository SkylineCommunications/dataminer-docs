# Making a shape display the number of highlighted shapes on a page

In a Visio drawing, you can have a shape display the number of shapes on the page that are either highlighted or not.

1. Add a shape data field of type **Highlight** to the shape, and set its value to “*Count*”.

1. In the shape text, enter at least one of the following placeholders:

   - **\[Highlighted\]**: The number of highlighted shapes on the current page of the Visio drawing.

   - **\[NonHighlighted\]**: The number of non-highlighted shapes on the current page of the Visio drawing.

   - **\[Total\]**: The number of element or service shapes on the current page of the Visio drawing that have a shape data field of type **Highlight**.
