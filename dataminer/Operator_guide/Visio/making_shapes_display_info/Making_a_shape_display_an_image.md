# Making a shape display an image

Using a shape data field of type **Link**, you can make a shape display an image located on a web server or a DMA.

There are two ways in which you can achieve this:

- Embedding a web browser that displays your image. See [Linking a shape to a webpage](xref:Linking_a_shape_to_a_webpage)
- Configuring a video thumbnail URL to link to. See [Linking a shape to a video thumbnail](xref:Linking_a_shape_to_a_video_thumbnail)
