# Turning a shape into a button that opens a trend group

A Visio shape can be turned into a button that opens a trend group.

To do so, add the following shape data items to the shape:

- a shape data field of type **Component** set to *Trending*

- a shape data field of type **ComponentOptions** set to *TrendGroup=xxx* (in which “xxx” is the name of the trend group)
