# Creating a button to navigate to a page of the current Visio drawing

If a Visio drawing contains multiple pages, you can configure a shape that, when clicked, will make a particular page of the drawing be displayed.

> For an example, see [Ziine](xref:ZiineDemoSystem) > *Visual Overview Design Examples* view > *[linking > OTHER]* page.

## Configuring the shape data field

Add a shape data field of type **NavigatePage** to the shape, and set its value to the name of the page to be displayed.
