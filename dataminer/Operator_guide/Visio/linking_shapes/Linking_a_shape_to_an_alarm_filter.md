# Linking a shape to an alarm filter

If you link a shape to an alarm filter, it can be used to show statistical information about the alarms that match the filter.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Depending on their security level, different users may see different statistics.
> - Because Visio files need to be able to display information for all users, only shared filters can be used.
> - Cleared alarms are automatically removed from alarm filters in Visio. For information or suggestion events, this means that only open events are included, e.g. when a backup is currently ongoing.
> - For an example, see [Ziine](xref:ZiineDemoSystem) > *Visual Overview Design Examples* view > *[linking > ALARM]* page.

Configure the shape data fields as follows:

1. Add a shape data field of type **AlarmSummary** to the shape, and set its value as follows:

   ```txt
   type|sharedfiltername|ApplyLinkedViewServiceOrElementFilter|Alarm|FilterContext=X
   ```

   - **type**: Can be "all", "active", "information", or "masked". This corresponds with the type of alarm list: all alarms (including suggestion events), active alarms, information events or masked alarms.

   - **sharedfiltername**: The name of the shared alarm filter, without "(shared filter)" suffix.

   - **ApplyLinkedViewServiceOrElementFilter**: Can be "true" or "false". If true, an additional dynamic filter is added, requiring the alarms to match the view, service or element to which the Visio file is linked.

   - **Alarm**: Use this option if you want the shape background to take the color associated with the summary alarm state of the alarm list.

   - **FilterContext=X**: Allows you to specify a filter context.

     - This can be an **element, service or view filter**. In this case, "X" is the name or ID of the element, service or view.
     - From DataMiner 10.3.0/10.2.3 onwards, you can add an **EPM system name filter**. In that case, "X" should be "SystemName=" followed by the EPM system name.
     - From DataMiner 10.3.0/10.2.3 onwards, you can add an **EPM system type filter**. In that case, "X" should be "SystemType="followed by the EPM system type.
     - The SystemName and SystemType context can be combined using the syntax `FilterContext=SystemName=X;SystemType=Y`.

   For example:

   | Shape data field | Value                                                      |
   | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
   | AlarmSummary     | all\|MySharedFilter\|false\|Alarm\|FilterContext=MyService |

   | Shape data field | Value                                                                          |
   | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | AlarmSummary     | active\|MySharedFilter\|false\|Alarm\|FilterContext=SystemName=MyEPMSystemName |

1. Optionally, to customize the default alarm level of the shape when the filter yields no results, add a shape data field of type **Options** and set its value to "DefaultAlarmLevel=*AlarmLevel*". For example:

   | Shape data field | Value                    |
   | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
   | Options          | DefaultAlarmLevel=Normal |

1. Optionally, you can configure the shape so that clicking it opens an alarm tab in the Alarm Console, containing the alarms matching the alarm filter. To do so, add a shape data field of type **AlarmTab**, and set it to "Name=\*\*AlarmTabName".

   For example:

   | Shape data field | Value              |
   | ---------------- | ------------------ |
   | AlarmTab         | Name=MyFilteredTab |

## Placeholders

The value of an **AlarmSummary** shape data field can contain dynamic placeholders like \[param:...\], etc. See [Placeholders for variables in shape data values](xref:Placeholders_for_variables_in_shape_data_values).

In addition, you can also use the following placeholders in the shape text itself, so that they are replaced by statistical information in Visual Overview.

| Placeholder  | Value                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| #Alarms      | Number of alarms             |
| #NewAlarms   | Number of new alarms         |
| #Critical    | Number of critical alarms    |
| #Major       | Number of major alarms       |
| #Minor       | Number of minor alarms       |
| #Warning     | Number of warning alarms     |
| #Notice      | Number of notice alarms      |
| #Error       | Number of error alarms       |
| #Information | Number of information events |
| #Masked      | Number of masked alarms      |
| #Normal      | Number of normal alarms      |
| #Timeout     | Number of timeout alarms     |
