# Making a shape display the current value of a variable

Using a shape data field of type **Variable**, you can make a shape display the current value of a variable.

## Configuring the shape data field

Add a shape data field of type **Variable** to the shape, and set its value to:

```txt
VariableName|Options
```

Also, if the scope of the variable is not the default scope (i.e. the current DataMiner Cube session), then add an additional shape data field of type **Options**, and set its value to the correct scope. See [Indicating the scope of the variable](xref:Turning_a_shape_into_a_control_to_update_a_session_variable#indicating-the-scope-of-the-variable).

## Options

You can make a shape appear, disappear, flip or rotate based on the current value of a session variable, by adding certain options to the **Variable** shape data field.

## Placeholder for variable value in shape text

The value of the session variable will appear on the shape only if you add shape text that contains a "\*" character. This character will then be replaced by the current value of the property.

To add text to a shape, just double-click the shape, and enter the text.

## Using the current value of a session variable in an expression

If you want to use the current value of a session variable in an expression (e.g. the value of some shape data field), use a \[var:...\], \[WorkspaceVar:...\], \[cardvar:...\] or \[pagevar:...\] placeholder (depending on the scope). This way you can e.g. link a shape to an element or view using a session variable.

From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU14]/10.4.0 [CU2]/10.4.5 onwards<!--RN 38910-->, you can add the "WaitForValue" option to the \[var:...\], \[cardvar:...\], and \[pagevar:...\] placeholders to prevent the placeholder from being resolved until the variable is set to a value. For example: `[var:testvar,WaitForValue]`.

> [!NOTE]
> If the variable name contains commas, by default, the text before the first valid option will be considered the name of the variable. For example, in the placeholder `[var:my,var,WaitForValue,NotValidOption]`, "my,var" will be considered the name of the variable. This default behavior can be overruled by using a `[sep]` placeholder. For example, in the placeholder `[cardvar:[sep:,$]test,var$WaitForValue]`, "test,var" will be considered the name of the variable.
