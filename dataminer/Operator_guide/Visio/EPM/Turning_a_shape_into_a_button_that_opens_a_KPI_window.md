# Turning a shape into a button that opens a KPI window

If, in an EPM environment, you want to turn an automatically generated element shape into a button that opens a KPI window when clicked, you can use a shape data field of type **LinkOptions** set to “*KpiWindow*”.

## Configuring the shape data field

Add a shape data field of type **LinkOptions** to the shape, and set its value to “*KpiWindow*”.
