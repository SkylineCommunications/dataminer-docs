# Marking a page of a Visio drawing as the default page

Using a shape data field of type **InlineVdx**, you can mark a page of a Visio drawing as the default page to be displayed.

When, for example, a shape data field of type **VdxPage** is set to “\[auto\]”, DataMiner will visualize the page of which the **InlineVdx** field is set to *TRUE*.

## Configuring the shape data field

Add a shape data field of type **InlineVdx** to the page, and set its value to TRUE.
