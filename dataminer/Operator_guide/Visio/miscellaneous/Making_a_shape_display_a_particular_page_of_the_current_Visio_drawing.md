# Making a shape display a particular page of the current Visio drawing

When a shape is linked to a view, a service or an element, it can be set to display a page of the Visio drawing linked to that view, service or element. A shape can also be configured to display a page of the current Visio drawing when the shape is not linked to a particular object, or when it is linked to a different kind of object, e.g. an alarm.

That page can be displayed:

- inside the shape itself,
- in a pop-up window that appears when the shape is clicked,
- in a normal, undocked window that appears when the shape is clicked, or
- in a tooltip.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - You can only make a shape display pages other than the page actually containing the shape. This restriction is necessary to avoid loops of inline pages.
> - If a shape displays content from another Visio page, this means multiple pages will need to be loaded at the same time in Visual Overview. This could potentially affect the loading times and overall user experience. When you create such a drawing, make sure to assess performance to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Basic shape data field configuration

Add a shape data field of type **VdxPage** to the shape, and set its value to the name of the page, optionally followed by "\|Popup", "\|Window" or "\|Tooltip":

```txt
PageName|Option
```

| Shape data value  | Result                                                                        | Example                |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| PageName          | The page is displayed in the shape itself.                                    | MyPage                 |
| PageName\|Popup   | The page is displayed in a pop-up window when the shape is clicked.           | MyPage\|Popup          |
| PageName\|Window  | The page is displayed in a normal, undocked window when the shape is clicked. | MyOtherPage\|Window    |
| PageName\|Tooltip | The page is displayed in a tooltip.                                           | MySpecialPage\|Tooltip |

> [!NOTE]
> If, in the value of the **VdxPage** shape data field, you replace the page name by "\[auto\]", the window will contain the page of which the **InlineVdx** shape data field has been set to TRUE. See [Marking a page of a Visio drawing as the default page](xref:Marking_a_page_of_a_Visio_drawing_as_the_default_page).

## Optional configuration

To fine-tune the way the page is displayed, a number of additional options are available:

- [Making the window close automatically](#making-the-window-close-automatically)
- [Configuring what should happen when a window is closed](#configuring-what-should-happen-when-a-window-is-closed)
- [Configuring the size of the window](#configuring-the-size-of-the-window)
- [Configuring a custom shortcut menu](#configuring-a-custom-shortcut-menu)
- [Setting the border style of the window](#setting-the-border-style-of-the-window)
- [Setting the pop-up window to be displayed in front of other windows](#setting-the-pop-up-window-to-be-displayed-in-front-of-other-windows)

### Making the window close automatically

If **VdxPage** is set to "PageName\|Popup", you can make the pop-up window close automatically when a shape is clicked inside the window. To do so, add a shape data field **Options** and set it to "AutoClosePopup":

| Shape data field | Value          |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| VdxPage          | MyPage\|Popup  |
| Options          | AutoClosePopup |

Alternatively, you can configure a specific shape within the pop-up window to close the window after the shape's main action is executed. To do so, add the "ClosePage" option to the shape data of the shape:

| Shape data field | Value     |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Options          | ClosePage |

### Configuring what should happen when a window is closed

The **OnClosing** page-level shape data field allows you to configure what should happen when a Visual Overview window is closed. Depending on how this shape data is configured, a message box will be displayed asking for confirmation, possibly with a custom message.

In this shape data field, specify a script (example: *Script:MyScript*), and make sure the script contains an instruction like the following one:

```txt
engine.AddScriptOutput(UIVariables.VisualOverview.ClosingWindow_Result,ClosingMode.Continue.ToString());
```

The session variable named *ClosingWindow_Result* can be set to "Continue", "Stop" or "Abort".

In the example above, it is set to "Continue". If *ClosingWindow_Result* is set to "Stop", a message box of type "Yes/No" will appear. If the user then clicks *Yes*, the window will be closed. Note that in the session variable named *ClosingWindow_Message*, you can specify a custom message to be displayed. If you specify such a message, then it will be shown in a message box of type "OK", regardless of the value of the *ClosingWindow_Result* variable. However, if *ClosingWindow_Result* is set to "Stop", this custom message will be displayed in the message box of type "Yes/No" mentioned above.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The **OnClosing** shape data field only works for windows. It does not work for message boxes or tooltips.
> - The **OnClosing** and **OnClose** shape data fields do not influence each other. Both function independently from each other.
> - If you want to combine **OnClosing** and **OnClose**, you can pass a session variable to the *OnClosing* script and make it return another session variable. That variable can then be passed to the *OnClose* script, which can optionally be made to return another session variable.

### Configuring the size of the window

If you added a "\|Popup" or a "\|Window" option to have the Visio page appear in a separate window, you can use a shape data field of type **LinkOptions** to set the size of that window.

To do so:

- Add a shape data field of type **LinkOptions** to the shape, and set its value to:

  ```txt
  Width=999|Height=999
  ```

  For both the width and the height of the window, specify either a fixed number of pixels or a placeholder referring to a property, a parameter or a session variable containing a number of pixels. See [Placeholders for variables in shape data values](xref:Placeholders_for_variables_in_shape_data_values).

> [!TIP]
> For an example, see [Ziine](xref:ZiineDemoSystem) > *Visual Overview Design Examples* view > *[inline visio > BUTTONS]* page.

### Configuring a custom shortcut menu

By default, when you right-click a Visio drawing displayed in a shape, the shortcut menu of the Visio drawing containing that shape will appear. If you want the Visio drawing inside the shape to have its own shortcut menu, add a shape data field of type **Options** to the shape displaying the Visio drawing, and set its value to "InlineVisioContextMenuVisible".

| Shape data field | Value                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Options          | InlineVisioContextMenuVisible |

### Setting the border style of the window

If you have added a "\|Window" option to have the Visio page appear in a separate window, to set the border style of the window, you can use a shape data field of type **LinkOptions** and set it to one of the following values:

| Value                          | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WindowStyle=SingleBorderWindow | The window will be displayed with a single border                                           |
| WindowStyle=ThreeDBorderWindow | The window will be displayed with a 3D border.                                              |
| WindowStyle=ToolWindow         | The window will be displayed as a fixed-size tool window without minimize/maximize buttons. |

### Setting the pop-up window to be displayed in front of other windows

If you have added a "\|Popup" or a "\|Window" option to have the Visio page appear in a separate window, to make sure the window is always displayed in front of the window it was launched from, you can use a shape data field of type **LinkOptions** and set it to "KeepOnTop=true".

| Shape data field | Value          |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| LinkOptions      | KeepOnTop=true |
