# Disabling the default hyperlink behavior of a linked shape

By default, when users click a shape linked to an element, service, redundancy group or view, the Visio drawing linked to that element, service, redundancy group or view will be opened.

To disable this default hyperlink behavior of a shape, add a shape data field to it of type **Enabled** and set its value to "FALSE".
