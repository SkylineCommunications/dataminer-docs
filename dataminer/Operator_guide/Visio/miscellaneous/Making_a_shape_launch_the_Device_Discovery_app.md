# Making a shape launch the Device Discovery app

If a shape is linked to a view, you can configure it to launch the Device Discovery app for that particular view when clicked.

To do so, add the following shape data:

| Shape data | Value            |
|------------|------------------|
| Execute    | Device discovery |

For example:

| Shape data | Value            |
|------------|------------------|
| View       | MyView           |
| Execute    | Device discovery |
