# Making shapes selectable

It is possible to tag a shape as "Selectable", so that instead of displaying the default hyperlink behavior, it will adopt a specially defined selection style when clicked.

> [!TIP]
> For an example, see [Ziine](xref:ZiineDemoSystem) > *Visual Overview Design Examples* view > *[misc > SELECTABLE]* page.

## Tagging a shape as selectable

To tag a shape as "Selectable", add a shape data field to it of type **Options**, and set its value to "Selectable".

```txt
Selectable
```

## Defining a selection style

To define the selection style:

1. Create a shape.

1. Change its style in Visio.

1. Add a shape data field to it of type **Options** and set its value to "SelectionStyle".

   When a "Selectable" shape is clicked, it will adopt the style of this shape.

   ```txt
   SelectionStyle
   ```

## Making a selectable shape get copied to a session variable

If you want the text in a "Selectable" shape to be copied to a session variable when clicked, do the following:

1. Add a shape data field of type **Options** to the page.

1. Set the value of the shape data field to "SelectionVar=VariableName".

   ```txt
   SelectionVar=VariableName
   ```

1. By default the values of the selected shapes will be separated by a pipe character ("\|"). However, you can optionally specify that a different separator character should be used, for example in case the values need to be used in an Automation script.

   To do so, after the "SelectionVar=VariableName" option, add "\|MultipleValueSep=", followed by the separator of your choice. For example, if you specify the following, a semicolon will be used as the separator symbol:

   ```txt
   SelectionVar=VariableName|MultipleValueSep=;
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> When shapes are automatically generated, you can define a *SelectionVar* on group level, i.e. on the shape (or the shape group) where you specified a shape data field of type **Children**.

### Having the Selectable shape copied to multiple session variables

It is possible to have the text of a "Selectable" shape copied to multiple session variables when a shape is clicked.

To do so, instead of specifying one variable name, as described above, specify a comma-separated list of session variables. The text displayed in the selectable shape will be copied to each of the listed variables when the shape is clicked.

| Shape data field | Value                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Options          | SelectionVar=*Var01*,*Var02*,*Var03* |

### Having specific information copied to particular session variables

When a Selectable shape is clicked, you can have information about the item to which the shape is linked get copied to the session variables listed in a "SelectionVar=" clause.

To do so, after you specify the variable, also specify the information to be set, using the same keywords as when making a shape display information about an item it is linked to.

| Shape data field | Value                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Options          | SelectionVar=*Var01*=*Keyword*,*Var02*=*Keyword*,*Var03*=*Keyword* |

> [!NOTE]
> For an overview of the keywords that can be used, see [Making a shape display information about the item it is linked to](xref:Making_a_shape_display_information_about_the_item_it_is_linked_to).

Example:

- In the following example, *Var01* will be set to the name of the object to which the shape is linked, and *Var02* will be set to the ID of the object to which the shape is linked.

  | Shape data field | Value                            |
  | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | Options          | SelectionVar=Var01=Name,Var02=ID |

- In the following example, the shape is linked to an alarm. *Var01* will be set to the alarm ID, and *Var02* will be set to the alarm property called "Priority".

  | Shape data field | Value                                                    |
  | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Options          | SelectionVar=Var01=Alarm ID,Var02=AlarmProperty:Priority |
