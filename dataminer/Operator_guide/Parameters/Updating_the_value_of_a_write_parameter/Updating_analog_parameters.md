# Updating analog parameters

For analog parameters, a box is displayed with a slider control. To update the parameter:

1. Enter the new value in one of the following ways:

   - Enter the new value directly in the box.

     > [!NOTE]
     >
     > - You can copy the current value of the parameter into the box by right-clicking the value and selecting *Copy value to editor*.
     > - When you update the value of an analog write parameter, the DMS checks the range and the step size of the new value before sending it to the device. If you enter a value that is not accepted by the protocol, the change to the parameter will not be accepted.

   - Drag the slider in order to select a value.

   - Click the up or down arrows to the right of the box to increase or decrease the value, starting from the current value of the parameter.

   - Click in the box and press the up or down key on the keyboard to increase or decrease the value, starting from the current value of the parameter.

     > [!NOTE]
     >
     > - Using the up and down arrows or keys is especially of use when making small adjustments to a current value, e.g. to change 25.08732 to 25.08733.
     > - If no value is currently set for a parameter and you use the up and down arrows or keys to enter a value, the increase or decrease will start from the minimum or the maximum value respectively.

1. Click the green button next to the parameter control to confirm.
