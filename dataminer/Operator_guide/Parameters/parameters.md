# Parameters

Parameters are variables that refer to specific data in the system. Their value may be retrieved from the data source or may depend on user input. Values may be part of a range limited by a particular minimum and maximum, or part of a limited set of predetermined values.

There are [different types of parameters](xref:Read_parameters_versus_write_parameters), including read and write parameters, table parameters, general parameters, and more. Write parameters allow you to [change their values](xref:Updating_the_value_of_a_write_parameter), while read parameters are for retrieving information. Parameter values are typically displayed as plain text, but you can [customize their appearance](xref:Changing_the_way_parameters_are_displayed).

In this section of the documentation you will also find instructions on how to [configure matrix parameters](xref:Configuring_matrix_parameters) and [work with Lite parameters](xref:Working_with_Lite_parameters), and information on [parameter dependencies](xref:Parameter_dependencies).
