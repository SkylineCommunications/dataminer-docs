# Changing the display settings for analog parameters

You can specify whether analog parameters are displayed as a LED bar or as an oscilloscope:

- by right-clicking the parameter and selecting *LED bar* or *Oscilloscope*, or

- by determining the preferred display mode in the user settings. See [Data Display settings](xref:User_settings#data-display-settings).

## LED bar

A LED bar shows the current value of a parameter on a scale that represents its entire range.

If the parameter is being monitored, different parts of the LED bar will be colored:

- the current value

- the different alarm thresholds at the bottom of the LED bar

If the parameter is not being monitored, all these parts will be white.

## Oscilloscope

An oscilloscope shows the evolution of a parameter value on a time scale.

- On the X-axis, you can find the beginning and the end of the displayed time span, as well as the total duration of that time span.

- On the Y-axis, you can find the units, as well as the minimum and maximum value of the oscilloscopeâ€™s range.

- New values enter on the right-hand side of the oscilloscope.

- When the parameter is monitored, vertical colored bars will appear to indicate when a parameter was in a certain alarm state.
