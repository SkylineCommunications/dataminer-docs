# Duplicating elements

To quickly add an element that is very similar to an existing element, you can duplicate that existing element:

1. Right-click the element in the Surveyor, and select *Duplicate*.

   The same card will open as when you [create an element](xref:Adding_elements), but with all information already filled in based on the element you have duplicated.

1. Make the necessary changes in the card, and click *Create*.

> [!NOTE]
> When you duplicate an SNMPv3 element from another DMA, you will need to enter the SNMPv3 credentials again for the element to work.
