# About elements

An element is a DataMiner object that represents a data source monitored by the DataMiner System. Elements serve as the digital twin of devices or products within your network.

In addition to regular DataMiner elements, different special types of elements exist, such as [hidden elements](xref:Hidden_elements), [virtual elements](xref:Virtual_elements), [dynamic virtual elements](xref:Dynamic_virtual_elements), [replicated elements](xref:Replicated_elements), and [Simulated elements](xref:Simulated_elements). These can all be grouped in views or services.

Elements can have different [states](xref:Element_states) and [element properties](xref:Element_properties) can be configured for them.
