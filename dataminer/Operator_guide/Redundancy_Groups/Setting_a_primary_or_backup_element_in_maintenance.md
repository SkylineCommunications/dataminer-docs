# Setting a primary or backup element in maintenance

If you want to prevent an element from being switched automatically, you can set it “in maintenance”.

- Go to the *Advanced* section of a redundancy group card.

- Click a *Switch to maintenance mode* button underneath a primary or backup element to switch that element to maintenance mode.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only perform the above-mentioned action if software redundancy has been configured for the redundancy group in question.
