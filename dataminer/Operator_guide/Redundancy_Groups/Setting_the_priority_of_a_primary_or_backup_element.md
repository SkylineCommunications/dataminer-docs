# Setting the priority of a primary or backup element

1. Right-click the element in the Surveyor and select *Multiple set.*

   > [!NOTE]
   > If *Multiple set* is not visible in the Surveyor right-click menu, make sure the [*Enable 'Multiple set'* Cube user setting](xref:User_settings#cube-settings) is enabled<!--RN 43135-->.

1. In the *Multiple set* window, do the following.

   1. In the *Parameter* box, select the general parameter *\[Priority Level\]*.

   1. Next to *Value*, specify the new priority.

   1. On the right, select the element(s) to which you wish to apply this priority.

   1. Click *Set*.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Element priority ranges from 1 (highest priority) to 1000 (lowest priority). If priority is set to 0, this means that no priority has been set yet.
> - Alternatively, the element priority can also be set on the *General parameters* page of each element.
