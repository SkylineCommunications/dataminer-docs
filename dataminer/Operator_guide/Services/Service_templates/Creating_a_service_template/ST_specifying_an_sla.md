# Specifying an SLA in a service template

In a service template, it is possible to specify that an SLA should be generated along with its generated services.

To do so:

1. Go to the *SLA* tab of the service template card.

1. Select *Create SLA*.

1. To create custom properties for the SLA, in the *Properties* section, click *Add SLA property*.

> [!NOTE]
> If an existing service template is updated to include an SLA element, while it did not include one before, an SLA element will be created. Similarly, if an existing service template is updated to no longer include an SLA element, the SLA element will be removed when the service template is applied.
