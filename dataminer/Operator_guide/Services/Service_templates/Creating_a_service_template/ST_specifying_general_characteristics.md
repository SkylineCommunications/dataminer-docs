# Specifying general characteristics of a service template

In the *General* tab of a service template card, enter the following information:

- **Template name**: The name of the service template.

- **Template description**: A short description of the template

In addition, two advanced options are available in the *General* tab:

- Select *Require confirmation before applying* to ensure that the user has to confirm before the service template is applied.

- Select *Auto execute template when new elements have been added in the system* to automatically apply the service template when a new element is added in the DMS.

> [!NOTE]
> If the service template is automatically applied when a new element is added, the *Background Tasks* window will appear so that you can follow the progress.

- Select *Keep duplicates of generated services when re-applying* to make sure that, if this service template is re-applied, any copies of services that were generated when it was applied earlier are not deleted.
