# Specifying the destination view of a service template

In a service template you can specify both the destination view of the generated services as that of the service template itself. Both are done in the *View* tab of the service template card.

To determine the destination view for the service template:

- Select one or more views in the section *Destination view template*.

To determine the destination view for the generated services, in the *Destination view generated services* section, choose one of the following three options:

- To generate the services in a predetermined view, select *Fixed view* and select the view in the drop-down list. Only one view can be specified in case a fixed view is used.

- To generate the services in the view where the template is applied, select *View on which template was applied*.

- To specify a view name, select *View by name* and specify the name. You can click the downward triangle to the right of this box to select placeholders. To specify multiple destination views, use a pipe character (“\|”) between the view names.
