# Service card header and footer

In the header of a service card, a breadcrumb trail is shown. In the header, you can:

- Navigate to a parent view by clicking it in the breadcrumb trail.

- Click the triangle to the right of an item to drill down to its child items.

If card footers are enabled, the footer displays the service alarm state in the last 24 hours. Double-click the colored bar indicating the alarm state to view related reports.

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on your user settings, the breadcrumb trail and/or card footer may not be displayed. See [Card settings](xref:User_settings#card-settings).
