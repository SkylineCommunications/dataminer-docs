# Service properties

As with elements, view, and alarms, it is possible to add properties to services in order to link additional information to them.

You can access these properties by right-clicking a service in the Surveyor, and selecting *Properties*.

For more information on how to add, change and delete service properties, see [Adding a custom property to an item](xref:Managing_element_properties#adding-a-custom-property-to-an-item), [Editing custom properties](xref:Managing_element_properties#editing-custom-properties) and [Deleting a custom property](xref:Managing_element_properties#deleting-a-custom-property).

> [!NOTE]
> Whenever a change occurs to a service property, an information event will be generated. Service properties will also be included in other service-related information events, for instance when a service is added or deleted. It is possible to use custom OIDs for these service properties. See [Custom DataMiner notification](xref:Custom_DataMiner_notification).
