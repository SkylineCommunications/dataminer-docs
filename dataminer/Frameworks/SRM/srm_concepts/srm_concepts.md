# SRM framework concepts

DataMiner Service and Resource Management makes use of many dedicated DataMiner components to configure the management and orchestration of services end to end. This section provides a high-level overview of these components and explains how they can be used.

Before you [set up and configure an SRM system](xref:srm_getting_started), it is essential that you understand what these different components are and what their purpose is.

A distinction is made between "SRM definitions" and "SRM instantiations". An SRM definition determines what an object will be like. You could compare it to a class. The actual object based on the SRM definition is called an SRM instantiation. For example, a connector, which is considered an SRM definition, defines how to communicate. The element that is created based on that connector is considered an SRM instantiation.

The tables below summarize the components and their scope.
