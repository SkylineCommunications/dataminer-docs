# Customizing the columns of the Bookings list

<!-- RN 24032 -->

On the [Bookings tab](xref:Booking_Manager_Bookings_tab) of the Booking Manager app, a list of bookings is displayed. You can customize which information is displayed in the different columns of this list. This includes adding or removing specific columns, and even extending the list with custom booking properties.

To customize the list:

1. Right-click the list header and select *Manage column configuration*.

1. Configure and save the columns as detailed under [Creating a new column configuration](xref:Creating_a_list_view#creating-a-new-column-configuration).

1. In the Booking Manager app, go to the *Config* > *General* page.

1. Click the pencil icon next to *Column Configuration* and enter the name of the column configuration you have just saved.

1. Close and reopen the Booking Manager app.

> [!NOTE]
> The Bookings list in the Booking Manager app is based on a *ListView* Visual Overview component. For more information, see [Creating a list view](xref:Creating_a_list_view).
