# Interacting with SRM using code

Many functionalities of the Booking Manager app are also available via scripts. Custom Automation scripts can be used to perform actions such as defining bookings, finishing bookings, etc. without any user interaction.

Before you interact with SRM using code, you will often need to [find the object reference of certain objects](xref:SRM_find_reference_of_object) first. With this, you can then for instance [execute actions without any user interaction](xref:Silent_actions).

> [!TIP]
> For more information about the types of scripts that are supported in the SRM framework, see [SRM scripting](xref:srm_scripting).

> [!NOTE]
> Since [Feature release 2.0.1](xref:SRM_2.0.1) of the SRM framework, the [SRM Dev Pack](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skyline.DataMiner.Core.SRM) is available, which allows you to easily add the required dependencies to develop these scripts. For details on how to install the NuGet on new or existing scripts, see [SRM scripting using the SRM Dev Pack](xref:srm_scripting_devpack).
