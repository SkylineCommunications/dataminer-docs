# CI Types

The *CI Types* subtab of the *Admin* tab consists of several pages with overview tables. At the top of the pages, buttons are available:

- **New**: Available on each of the pages. Starts a wizard that allow you to add a new CI Type. You will need to specify the CI Type name and can optionally configure discovery actions, provisioning, etc. for the CI Type.

- **Duplicate**: Available on each of the pages if a CI Type is selected in the table.

- **Import**: Only available on the *Overview* page. Opens a pop-up window where you can specify the file path and file name of a CI Type in order to import it.

- **Export**: Only available on the *Overview* page. Allows you to export the CI Type configuration for the selected entry in the table.

- **Export all**: Only available on the *Overview* page. Allows you to export the configuration of all CI Types.

  > [!NOTE]
  > By default, CI Types are exported to the folder `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\Skyline IDP CMDB\CI Types`.

- **Generate**: Only available on the *Overview* page. Starts a wizard that allows you to generate CI Types for the production protocols in the system. You can select to generate CI Types for all protocols, for all protocols that do not have a CI Type yet, or for a custom selection of protocols.

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > - The wizard also allows you to select "None", so that you can easily clear the selection of all listed protocols in order to make a custom selection afterwards.
  > - By default, CI Types generated based on a protocol with an SNMPv3 connection have SNMPv2 port settings configured on that connection, as there is no way to automatically find out the security levels, algorithms and passwords.

  > [!TIP]
  > You can for instance use the *Generate* option to have existing DataMiner elements managed by IDP. You will then need to [correctly configure the CI Type](xref:CI_Types#using-the-ci-type-management-wizard), [enable the necessary activities](xref:Admin_activities) for the CI Type, and [add the element to the managed elements](xref:IDP_Inventory_tab#unmanaged).

## Using the CI Type Management wizard

On the *CI Types* subtab of the *Admin* tab, several buttons provide access to the CI Type Management wizard. In this wizard, you can configure the CI Type for discovery, provisioning, connectivity, configuration management, software image management and facilities.

The first window of the wizard contains *Configure* buttons for each of these. Depending on where you access the wizard from, this window may not be displayed.

In the first window, you can also delete the CI Type with the *Delete* button, but only if no elements are currently assigned to it.

To save changes to the configuration, use the *Save* button. To do so, you may first need to click *Previous* in order to return to the first window of the wizard.

### Discovery configuration

The discovery configuration window of the CI Type Management wizard allows you to edit the current discovery identifiers and add new discovery identifiers:

- **Current Discovery Identifiers**: This section displays the currently configured identifiers. If an identifier and discovery profile match the specified value according to the selected match operator, the CI Type will be used for a device. To edit the current identifiers, you can select a different operator in the *Match* box and/or specify a different value.

- **Conditions**: If only one identifier is configured, the *Conditions* box should simply contain "1". If there are more identifiers, there must be a number for each of them, and they must be combined with logical operators (*not*, *and*, or *or*). For example: "1 and 2".

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > - If different logical operators are combined in the *Conditions* expression, the order of boolean algebra is followed. This means the order of operations is, from highest priority to lowest, NOT then AND and finally OR.
  > - Parentheses are currently not supported in conditions. For more information, see [ConditionsOptions](xref:CI_Types1#conditionsoptions).

- **Add New Discovery Identifiers**: To add a new discovery identifier, first select the type, then click the triangle button to expand the configuration section for the identifier. Alternatively, you can immediately click the triangle button to see all possible types. Click "+" next to the type you want to add. Then select a *Match* operator and specify the value that should be used to detect if the CI Type should be used.

### Provisioning configuration
