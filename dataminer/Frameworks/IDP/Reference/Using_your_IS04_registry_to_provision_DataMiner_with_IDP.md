# Using your IS-04 registry to provision DataMiner with IDP

Below, you can find how you can configure DataMiner IDP to use an NMOS IS-04 registry, so that the registered IS-04 nodes are provisioned in the DMS.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> From IDP 1.5.0 onwards, the IS-04 scripts are not included in the IDP package.

## Installation

- Make sure your DataMiner System has been upgraded to the correct minimum version required for the version of Process Automation that you intend to use, or preferably, simply upgrade to the [latest DataMiner feature release](https://community.dataminer.services/downloads/).

- Install [DataMiner IDP with Process Automation](xref:Installing_DataMiner_IDP).

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > IS-04 workflows are no longer supported as of Process Automation 1.3. To follow the procedure below, make sure you use an earlier version of Process Automation.

- Make sure a DataMiner element is available that uses the connector [AMWA NMOS IS-04 Registry](https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/8d35e7a2-666c-424c-8966-0ff16e863782). During element creation, the *IP address/host* of the connection *HTTP Connection Main* must be set to the IP address of the IS-04 registry.

## Configuration

### Adding the element property IS-04 Node GUID

> [!NOTE]
> This is no longer necessary from IDP version 1.1.15 onwards.
> From IDP version 1.1.15 onwards, the property can be added via the *CI Type Management* wizard instead. For more information, see [Editing the provisioning details of a CI type](#editing-the-provisioning-details-of-a-ci-type).

Add the custom element property *IS-04 Node GUID*, as described in [Adding a custom property to an item](xref:Managing_element_properties#adding-a-custom-property-to-an-item). Make sure to specify the options as shown in figure 1 below.

![Configuration of element property IS-04 Node GUID](~/dataminer/images/IDP_IS-04_1.png)<br>
*Figure 1: Configuration of element property IS-04 Node GUID*

When an element is provisioned for an IS-04 node that registered itself to the IS-04 registry, the custom update property script will fill in this element property with the node's [Node ID](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-04/releases/v1.3.1/docs/5.1._Data_Model_-_Identifier_Mapping.html#node-id).

It is important that the Node ID is stored on the provisioned elements, as this is how the connector *AMWA NMOS IS04 Registry* will identify if a node has already been provisioned. If this property is not configured or not filled in by the custom update property script, each node update will trigger the provisioning of a new element.

### Configuring the CI types

DataMiner IDP will perform a discovery for the registered nodes that have not yet been provisioned. However, to discover and provision elements, DataMiner IDP needs correctly configured CI types.

You can add CI types in the IDP app on the tab *Admin > CI Types*. For more information, see [CI types](xref:CI_Types).

#### Editing the discovery details of a CI type

In the IDP app, there are two ways to start editing the discovery details for a specific CI type:

- Go to *Admin > CI Types > Overview*, click the *Edit* button, and then click the *Configure* button next to *Discovery*.

- Go to *Admin > CI Types > Overview*, and click the *Advanced* button.

Either way, a pop-up window will open. In this window, select one or more discovery identifiers from the list at the bottom. The discovery identifiers are defined in discovery profiles. If you need other discovery identifiers than the ones that are listed, you will need to [create new discovery profiles](#creating-new-discovery-profiles-optional).

The configured discovery details will be used to identify a CI type when a response is received from a device. For example, the CI type shown in figure 2 will be identified when a device returns a *sysObjectID* equal to 1.3.6.1.4.1.8813.2.993.1 or 1.3.6.1.4.1.8813.2.993.1.

The *Conditions* field supports logical operators as explained in [Conditions Options](xref:CI_Types1).

*Figure 2 Discovery details of a CI type using SNMPv2 discovery identifiers*

> [!NOTE]
> DataMiner IDP also supports discovery using HTTP(S), so you could also use the [NMOS Node API](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-04/releases/v1.3.1/APIs/NodeAPI.html) to identify a CI type. However, this requires that you [create a new discovery profile](#creating-new-discovery-profiles-optional).

#### Editing the provisioning details of a CI type

In the IDP app, there are two ways to start editing the provisioning details for a specific CI type:

- Go to *Admin > CI Types > Overview*, click the *Edit* button, and then click the *Configure* button next to *Provisioning*.

- Go to *Admin > CI Types > Overview*, and click the *Advanced* button.

Either way, a pop-up window will open. In this window, you need to configure the following information.

- The **name** of the provisioned element. You can use the placeholder *[IPAddress]*, as illustrated in figure 3. This will be dynamically replaced with the IP address of the discovered device.

- The **connector** that should be used for the CI type. To configure this, click the *Details* button next to *Element Details*. Figure 4 illustrates the window that will then be displayed. In this window:

    - You must select the protocol and version.
    - You can optionally already configure other aspects of the element configuration, such as the alarm and trend template, the ports, the initial element state, etc.

- The **IS-04 Node GUID** property (possible from IDP 1.1.15 onwards). To add this property, click the *Properties* button. In the *Other Properties* section, you can then select to *Use an existing property* if the property already exists in the DMS, or otherwise select *Create new property*. Then specify the property and click *Add* (see figure 5).

### Creating new discovery profiles (optional)

In case the equipment cannot be discovered using the discovery identifiers from the out-of-the box discovery profiles, you need to define new discovery profiles.

To do so, create JSON files and import them into DataMiner IDP as explained in [Discovery profiles](xref:Discovery_profiles).

Once you have imported a discovery profile, you can use its discovery identifiers to configure the discovery details of CI types.

### Configuring the Update Property Script

> [!NOTE]
> This is no longer necessary from IDP version 1.1.15 onwards.

When an element has been provisioned, DataMiner IDP can run the *Update Property Script*. This is an Automation script that is configured per CI type. The *Update Property Script* needs to find the Node ID of the provisioned element and configure it on the element property *IS-04 Node GUID*.

DataMiner IDP comes with an example script *IDP_Example_Custom_UpdateProperties*, which can be used as a starting point. You can [duplicate this script](xref: Managing_Automation_scripts#adding-a-new-automation-script) and change it as follows:

1. First, the script must identify the IP address of the device using the supplied DataMiner and element ID.
1. Next, it must use the IP address to look up the Node ID on the element using the *AMWA NMOS IS-04 Registry* connector.
1. Finally, it must fill in the Node ID in the custom element property *IS-04 Node GUID*.

When the script has been implemented, you need to configure the necessary CI types with this script. You can do so in the provisioning details of the CI types (see figure 3). You can select any of the scripts from the folder configured with the *CI Update Property Script Folder* setting, which is available on the *Admin > Settings* page of the IDP app.

### Configuring the Automation settings

After the CI types have been configured with discovery and provisioning details as described above, go to the *Admin > Activities* (or in *Processes > Activities* prior to IDP 1.1.20) page of the IDP app and verify whether the discovery and provisioning operations are enabled.

## Starting the IS-04 processes

For the IS-04 nodes to be provisioned, there have to be two active processes:

- A process using the existing process [IDP IS-04 Provision New Nodes](#idp-is-04-provision-new-nodes). This process will be used when an IS-04 node registers itself with the IS-04 registry, and no element in the DMS exists for it yet. This process performs a discovery, identifies the correct CI type of the node and provisions an element for it.

- A process using the existing process [IDP IS-04 Update Existing Nodes](#idp-is-04-update-existing-nodes). This process will be used when an IS-04 node registers itself with the IS-04 registry, and an element in the DMS already exist for it. This process will update the IP address of the IS-04 node by reapplying the CI type on the provisioned element.

It is advised to make sure both processes are always active. You can do so by setting the activation window type to *Permanent* (see figure 6) in the *Process Automation Wizard*.

![](~/dataminer/images/IDP_IS-04_6-1024x131.png)<br>
*Figure 7: Activities in the process IDP IS-04 Provision New Nodes*

To create an active process:

1. Launch the Process Automation Wizard, as explained in [Processes](xref:IDP_Processes_tab).

1. In the first step of the wizard, fill in the name, activation window type and activation window time (see figure 6).

1. In the second step, select the existing process *IDP IS-04 Provision New Nodes*.

1. For each activity, select a profile and resource. It is advised to select a resource pool. If necessary, create a custom profile (see example in figure 8):

    - For the activity *SLC IDP Convert To Scan Range*, the profile should specify the discovery profile that is used to discover the CI types.
    - For the activity *SLC IDP Discover Data Source*, the discovery details should be specified.
    - For the activity *SLC IDP Provision Element*, the source of the provisioned elements should be specified.

1. Finally, in the third step, select a profile and resource for the token, and click *Create* (see figure 9).
