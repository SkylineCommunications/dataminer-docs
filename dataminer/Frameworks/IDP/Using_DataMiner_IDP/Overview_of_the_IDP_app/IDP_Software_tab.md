# Software tab

This tab allows you to manage software updates of managed elements. At the top of the tab, you will find a summary of the software status of all managed devices.

The table below this lists the managed elements of which the CI Type has *Software Update* and/or *Software Compliancy* enabled (via *Admin* > *Activities*, or *Processes* > *Automation* in older IDP versions). Several buttons are available above the table:

- *Show Details*: Only available if a single element is selected. Displays the software details for the element, such as the expected software version, detected software version, software image location and deployed software version.

- *Update*: Opens a wizard to perform a software update on the selected elements.

- *Check compliancy*: Checks if the selected elements use the expected software version.
