# Creating an organization

At present, the dedicated UI to create an organization is still being developed.

For now, to create an organization, you will need to partially follow the [procedure to create a new DMS on dataminer.services](xref:Creating_a_DMS_on_dataminer_services):

1. On [dataminer.services](https://dataminer.services/), make sure you are logged in and then click *Add a DataMiner System*.

   ![Add a new DataMiner System button](~/dataminer/images/daas_create_001.png)

1. Click *DataMiner as a Service*.

1. Click *Create a new organization*.

1. Specify the name and the URL for the organization.

   In the URL of the organization only lowercase alphanumerical characters (a-z and 0-9) are allowed. The URL cannot consist of numbers only.

1. Click *Create*.

At this point, the organization is created, and you can close the page. There is no need to actually create a system.
