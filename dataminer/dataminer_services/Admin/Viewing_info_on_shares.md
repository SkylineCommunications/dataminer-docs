# Viewing information on shares

In the Admin app, you can view information about items that have been shared via dataminer.services from a specific DMS.

To do so:

1. In the [Admin app](xref:Accessing_the_Admin_app), check whether the correct organization is mentioned in the header bar.

1. If a different organization should be selected, click the organization selector ![Organization selector](~/dataminer/images/Cloud_Admin_Selector_icon.png) in the top-right corner and select the organization in the list.

1. In the pane on the left, under *DataMiner Systems*, expand the DataMiner System, and select the *Outgoing Shares* page.

   This page lists all items that have been shared via dataminer.services from the selected DMS.

   Click an item in the list to view more detailed information, including when the share was created and how long it will remain available.

> [!NOTE]
> Audit information about shares is available on the *Organization* > *Audit* page (see [Consulting dataminer.services audit logs](xref:Auditing)).
