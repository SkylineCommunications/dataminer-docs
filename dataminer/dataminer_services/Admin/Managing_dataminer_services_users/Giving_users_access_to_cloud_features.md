# Controlling user access to dataminer.services features

If users have a dataminer.services account (i.e. they are registered on <https://dataminer.services>), you can control whether they have access to dataminer.services features. This includes remote access to a DataMiner System via web apps such as the DataMiner Monitoring app, the use of the [Teams bot](xref:DataMiner_Teams_bot), etc. For this purpose, you must add their dataminer.services account to your organization and to the DataMiner System.

## Giving a user access to dataminer.services features

1. As the owner or administrator of your organization, [open the Admin app](xref:Accessing_the_Admin_app).

   > [!NOTE]
   > When a DataMiner System is connected to dataminer.services, the user configuring the connection selects or creates an organization. The DataMiner System is then considered part of the specified organization. If a new organization is created, the person creating it is automatically considered to be its owner.

1. In the Admin app, check whether the correct organization is mentioned in the header bar.

1. If a different organization should be selected, click the organization selector ![Organization selector](~/dataminer/images/Cloud_Admin_Selector_icon.png) in the top-right corner and select the organization in the list.

1. In the sidebar on the left, navigate to *Organization* > *Users*.

1. At the top of the window, click *Add user*.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you do not have sufficient rights to add users to your organization, this button will be disabled<!--RN 40234-->.

1. Specify the email address that is used for the user on dataminer.services and click *Add*.

1. Select the *Users* page for the DataMiner System you want to add the user to.

1. At the top of the page, click *Add user*.

1. Specify the email address that is used for the user on dataminer.services, and click *Add*.

> [!NOTE]
> If users need to have remote access to the DataMiner System via web apps, make sure remote access to the web apps is enabled. See [Controlling remote access with the Admin app](xref:Controlling_remote_access).

## Revoking access to dataminer.services features

1. As the owner or administrator of your organization, [open the Admin app](xref:Accessing_the_Admin_app).

1. In the Admin app, check whether the correct organization is mentioned in the header bar.

1. If a different organization should be selected, click the organization selector ![Organization selector](~/dataminer/images/Cloud_Admin_Selector_icon.png) in the top-right corner and select the organization in the list.

1. In the sidebar on the left, navigate to *Organization* > *Users*.

1. In the list of users, on the right, click the user icon with an x in the lower-right corner to revoke access for a specific user.

1. Click *Remove* to confirm that the user should be removed from the organization on dataminer.services, so that they will no longer have access to the DMS.
