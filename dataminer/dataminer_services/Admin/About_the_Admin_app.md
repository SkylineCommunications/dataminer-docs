# About the Admin app

The Admin app is intended for the management of DataMiner Systems connected to dataminer.services. Among others, it allows you to [manage dataminer.services users](xref:Managing_dataminer_services_users) for your organization, [control remote access](xref:Controlling_remote_access), [manage the nodes of your DataMiner Systems](xref:Managing_cloud-connected_nodes), view [information on deployments](xref:Viewing_info_on_deployments), [shares](xref:Viewing_info_on_shares), and [system usage](xref:Viewing_info_on_system_usage), and much more.

Note that depending on your user permissions, some pages in the Admin app may not be available for you.
