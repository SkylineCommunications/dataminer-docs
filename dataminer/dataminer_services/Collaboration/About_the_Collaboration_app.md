# About the Collaboration app

As part of dataminer.services, the Collaboration app allows Skyline customers and DataMiner Strategic Partners to keep track of all their ongoing projects ordered from Skyline.

It provides an overview of all deliverables along with their statuses. Deliverables can include software licenses as well as professional services for deployment and configuration of DataMiner solutions, training, consultancy, etc.

For customers with an active DataMiner Maintenance & Support agreement, Collaboration also provides access to all tickets related to support services.
