# List of tasks linked to a project

When you click a project in the *My projects* tab, you will see the list of tasks linked to that particular project, grouped per task status. Each group can be collapsed or expanded at will.

- To filter down the list of tasks to find those that contain a particular piece of text, enter that text in the *Search* box at the top of the list.

- To sort the list of tasks by a particular property, or filter it by status, type, label (i.e. a free-form identifier added by someone at Skyline) and/or project, click the button to the right of the search box.

    - To sort the list, select a property and indicate the order (ascending or descending) by toggling the button to the right of it.

    - To filter the list, select a status, a type, a label, an assignee and/or a project. If you only want to see the tasks that are flagged as a project risk, then select “Yes” under Project risk.

        > [!NOTE]
        > By default, tasks with the status “Closed” are not listed. If you want the list to show tasks that have been closed, open the status selection box and click the *Looking for closed tasks?* option at the bottom of the list. When you then click *Proceed* to load all closed tasks of the current project, a warning will appear.

- To create a new task under the current project, click *New task*. For more information on how to create a task, see [Creating a new task under the current project](xref:Creating_a_new_task_under_the_current_project).

- To consult or edit a task, click the task in the list. The contents of the task will appear in an adjacent pane on the right. For more information on how to consult or edit a task, see [Consulting or editing a task](xref:Consulting_or_editing_a_task).
