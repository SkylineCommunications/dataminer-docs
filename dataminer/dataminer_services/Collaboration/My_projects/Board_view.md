# Board view

When you click the *Board* tab, you will see the list of tasks linked to the current project in a board view.

Each of the colored panes in this view represents a task status, and contains the tasks that have that particular status. If none of the tasks under the current project have a particular status, the pane representing that status will by default be collapsed. Clicking a collapsed pane will expand it (and vice versa).

The task status panes are organized left to right and show the logical evolution of a task throughout its lifecycle from creation to closure.

- To search for tasks that contain a particular piece of text, enter that text in the *Search* box at the top of the list.

- To sort the list of tasks by a particular property, or filter it by status, type, label, assignee and/or task group, click the button to the right of the search box.

  - To sort the list, select a property and indicate the order (ascending or descending) by toggling the button to the right of it.

  - To filter the list, select a status, a type, a label, an assignee and/or a project. If you only want to see the tasks that are flagged as a project risk, then select “Yes” under Project risk.

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, the status “Closed” is not listed. If you want the list to show tasks that have been closed, open the status selection box and click the *Looking for closed tasks?* option at the bottom of the list.

- To create a new task under the current project, click *New task*. For more information on how to create a task, see [Creating a new task under the current project](xref:Creating_a_new_task_under_the_current_project).

- To consult or edit a task, click the task in the list. The contents of the task will appear in a pop-up window. For more information on how to consult or edit a task, see [Consulting or editing a task](xref:Consulting_or_editing_a_task).

Below the board, a pane is available that consists of two tabs:

- *Buckets*: Contains custom groups of tasks, created by Skyline. If you click the filter button in the header of a group, the board view will be filtered to only show that group and its tasks.

- *Timeline*: Tasks that have a due date will be displayed on a timeline in this tab. By holding and dragging the mouse pointer to the left or to the right, you can go backwards or forwards in time.

You can change the size of this pane by dragging its upper border up or down, and collapse or expand it using the blue button on the right. Clicking a task in this pane will open the task in a pop-up window. See also [Consulting or editing a task](xref:Consulting_or_editing_a_task).

> [!NOTE]
> In the task board, a task group is indicated with a small icon in the top-left corner. However, checking a task group and the tasks it contains is much easier in the *Buckets* and *Timeline* tabs below the board.
