# List of projects

The projects listed on this tab are grouped per project status. Each group can be collapsed or expanded at will.

- To reduce the list of projects to those containing a particular piece of text, enter that text in the *Search* box at the top of the list.

- To drill down to the list of tasks linked to a project, click that project. For more information on this list of tasks, see [List of tasks linked to a project](xref:List_of_tasks_linked_to_a_project).

> [!NOTE]
> In the *My projects* tab, it is not possible to create new projects. A project is always automatically created by Skyline once a purchase order or a pre-sales activity is accepted and approved.
