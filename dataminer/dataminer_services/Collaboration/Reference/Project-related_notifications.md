# Project-related notifications

By default, you will receive an email

- when a task has been assigned to you, or

- when a task is no longer assigned to you.

In the body of the email, you will find

- the current state of the task, and

- a hyperlink to the task on the Collaboration website.

Optionally, you can also subscribe to all changes made to the tasks under a particular project. If you do so, you will receive an email each time a task is updated (e.g., when someone adds a comment to a particular task).

- If you want to subscribe to a particular project, please contact your Skyline Project Manager.
