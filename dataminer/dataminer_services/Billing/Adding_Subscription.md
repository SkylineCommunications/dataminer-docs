# Adding a subscription

To configure and purchase a new subscription for your organization:

1. Make sure you are logged in as an Owner or Admin of your organization.

   Users who do not have the Owner or Admin role will not be able to add a subscription.

1. Navigate to the [Billing](xref:Billing) page in the Admin app.

1. Click the **+ Add subscription** button in the top-right corner.

   This will open a window where you can select the services and reservations you need, choose the subscription duration, and see the total cost before confirming your purchase. For more information on these options, refer to the sections below

1. When you have fully configured your subscription, check the financial summary in the lower right corner, and make sure your organization has sufficient credits:

   - **Savings**: Shows the total credits saved compared to pay-per-use pricing. Higher volumes and longer durations typically result in greater savings.
   - **Total cost**: The total credit amount that will be charged for the subscription.
   - **Current balance**: Your organization's current credit balance.
   - **New balance**: Your projected balance after purchasing the subscription (Current balance - Total cost). Make sure this will be sufficient for ongoing operations.

1. Verify the subscription name, duration, and auto-renewal settings.

1. Click the **Confirm subscription** button to complete the purchase.

   Credits will be deducted immediately after the purchase. The new subscription will be created and will be shown in the [Subscriptions](xref:Subscriptions) table with an "Active" or "Planned" status.

## Subscription configuration options

### Service categories and reservations

On the left, the available service categories are organized into expandable sections. Each category contains specific services that you can include in your subscription.

For each service, you can configure the following settings:

- **Volume / Month**: Use the number input to set how many units of each service you want to reserve per month.
- **Rate**: Shows the cost per unit in credits (for example, "0.40 ⊙ / Each" or "2.00 ⊙ / 1,000"). When a discount is applied, the original price is shown with a strikethrough and the discounted price is displayed alongside a discount percentage badge (for example, "-10%").
- **Cost**: Shows the calculated cost for your selected volume (automatically updated as you adjust volumes).
- **Info icon**: Hover over the information icon to view available volume discount tiers for applicable services.

Some services offer **volume-based discounts**. As you adjust the volume, the discount is automatically applied and displayed in the *Rate* column:

- The original price appears with a strikethrough.
- The discounted price is shown next to it.
- A blue badge displays the discount percentage (for example, "-10%", "-15%", etc.).

Higher volumes and longer subscription durations typically unlock greater discount percentages.

### Subscription name

In the **Subscription name** field on the right, enter a custom name for your subscription. This will help you identify the subscription later in the *Subscriptions* table.

### Duration

Select the subscription duration:

- **1 year**: Standard annual subscription.
- **3 years**: Extended subscription for long-term commitment.
- **Custom**: Specify a custom number of months for the subscription duration.

Longer durations may qualify for additional discounts. You can also add shorter durations without discounts to lock in on the current credit rate.

### From

Use the date picker to select when the subscription should start. By default, this is set to the current date.

Note that you cannot select a date in the past.

### Auto renew

Toggle the **Auto renew** switch to enable automatic renewal:

- If this is enabled, the subscription will automatically renew on the expiration date with the same duration and reservation amounts, using the rates and discounts applicable at the time of renewal.
- Renewal requires sufficient credits in your organization's balance.
- New pricing may apply at renewal time.
- If insufficient credits are available, the subscription will not renew and the **Auto renew** switch will turn off.

For more information, see [Auto-Renewal](xref:Subscriptions#auto-renewal).

## Tips for creating subscriptions

- **Plan your volumes carefully**: Estimate your monthly usage to ensure you purchase adequate reservations while maximizing savings.
- **Check volume discounts**: For services with high usage, increasing volume may unlock significant discount tiers.
- **Consider longer durations**: Multi-year subscriptions often provide better pricing and reduce administrative overhead.
- **Monitor your balance**: Ensure you have enough credits for both the subscription purchase and ongoing pay-per-use services.
- **Use descriptive names**: Give subscriptions meaningful names to easily identify them later, especially if you have multiple subscriptions.
