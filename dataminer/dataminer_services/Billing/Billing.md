# About Billing

The Billing page provides a comprehensive overview of your organization's credit usage and costs for dataminer.services. It allows you to monitor your credit balance, track service consumption, view subscription costs, and analyze historical spending patterns to manage your DataMiner System expenses effectively.

## Balance

The **Balance** displays your current credit balance available for dataminer.services usage. This represents the total number of credits remaining in your account that can be used to pay for various services and subscriptions.

- Credits are consumed when using pay-per-use (PPU) services or when creating, renewing, or committing to a subscription (charged up front for the whole period).
- You can purchase additional credits using the **Buy credits** button located in the top-right corner.
- The balance is updated in real-time as services are consumed or when new credits are purchased.
- A low balance may impact your ability to use certain services, so monitoring this regularly is important.
- Click the **Credit history** button to view all credit transactions. See [Credit History](xref:Credit_History) for more information.

## Time Period Selection

Use the date selector at the top of the page to view billing information for different months, allowing you to analyze costs across different time periods.

## Services Table

The **Services** table provides a detailed breakdown of all services consuming credits in the selected time period. Services are organized into categories that can be expanded or collapsed for better overview.

Use the month selector at the top of the page to view costs for different months. Note that:

- The current month's data is updated on a daily basis with real-time usage.
- Previous months show finalized billing data.
- Billing for each month is processed on the 5th of the following month (e.g., January usage is billed on February 5th).

### Cost Indicators

Each service displays its credit cost with a color-coded indicator:

- **Green**: Subscriptions Cost.
- **Orange**: PPU Cost.

The costs shown reflect the consumption for the currently selected time period.

## Monthly Savings

The **Monthly Savings** indicator shows the amount of credits saved, when fully consuming all reservations in subscriptions, during the current month compared to standard pricing.

## Subscriptions Panel

- **Active subscriptions**: A list of all current subscriptions with their total costs.
- **Add subscription**: Button to purchase new subscriptions for additional services or capacity.
- **All subscriptions**: Link to view detailed information about all available and active subscriptions.

For more information on subscriptions, see [Subscriptions](xref:Subscriptions).

## Historical Cost Breakdown

The **Historical cost breakdown** chart visualizes your credit consumption over time, allowing you to:

- **Identify spending trends**: Track how your costs evolve over multiple months.
- **Compare cost types**: The chart distinguishes between:
  - **Subscription costs** (green bars): Fixed costs for active subscriptions. These costs are calculated pro-rata if a subscription doesn't start or end on the first/last day of the month.
  - **PPU costs** (orange bars): Variable costs based on actual service usage.
- **Plan budget**: Use historical data to forecast future costs and budget accordingly.
- **Detect anomalies**: Quickly spot unusual spikes in consumption that may require investigation.

The chart typically displays data for the last several months. Hover over individual bars to see exact credit amounts for each cost type.
