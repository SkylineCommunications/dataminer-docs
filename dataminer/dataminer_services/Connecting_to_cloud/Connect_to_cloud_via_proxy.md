# Connecting to dataminer.services via proxy server

From DataMiner CloudFeed 1.0.6, CloudGateway 2.7.0, and ArtifactDeployer 1.4.1 onwards, proxy support is available for these DxMs. This means that you can enable a proxy server so that all outgoing traffic towards the public internet will pass through that proxy server.

The proxy server has to support both HTTP and WebSocket traffic.

To configure this:

1. [Connect to dataminer.services](xref:Connect_to_dataminer_services).

1. In the folder `C:\ProgramData\Skyline Communications\DxMs Shared\` on the DMA, create the file *appsettings.proxy.json* if it does not already exist, and configure the *ProxyOptions* as follows:

   ```json
   {
      "ProxyOptions": {
         "Enabled": true,
         "Address": "<the address of the proxy server>"
      }
   }
   ```

   - **Enabled**: Set this to `true`.
   - **Address**: Specify the address of the proxy server. Example: `127.0.0.1:8080` or `localhost:5000`.

1. Restart the CloudGateway service for the changes to take effect.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you are using a version of CloudFeed prior to 1.1.0 or a version of ArtifactDeployer prior to 1.4.5, you will need to restart these DxMs as well.
