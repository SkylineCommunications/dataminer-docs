If you have the Owner or Admin role in the organization that published a Catalog item, and you want to remove this item from the Catalog again, you can do so as follows:

1. Navigate to the [Catalog](https://catalog.dataminer.services/) and make sure you are signed in.

1. Make sure the correct organization is selected in the top-right corner.

1. [Go to the details page](xref:Looking_up_an_item_in_the_catalog) of the Catalog item.

1. At the top of the page, click the ![Context menu button](~/dataminer/images/Catalog_context_menu.png) button and select *Delete*.

1. Specify the reason why you want to delete the item and confirm the deletion.
