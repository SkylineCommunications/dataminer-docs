# Managing your shares

In the Sharing app, you can view the items that are currently being shared with you.

- To quickly find a specific item, use the filter box in the top-right corner.

- Click a shared dashboard in the list to view this dashboard.

- To view more detailed information about a shared item, such as the person who shared the item with you and the date when it was shared with you, click the expand button to the right of the item.

- To stop sharing an item, click the "..." button to the right of the item and select *Remove*. You will then no longer have access to the item until someone shares it with you again.
