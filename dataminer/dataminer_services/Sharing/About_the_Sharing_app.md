# About the Sharing app

As part of dataminer.services, the Sharing app allows DataMiner users to share live data with anybody on the fly.

At present, only dashboard sharing is supported. However, in the future, this module will also allow you to share metrics, devices, services, user-definable apps and APIs, etc.
