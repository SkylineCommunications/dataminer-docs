# Changing the email address associated with your dataminer.services account

To change your email address for your dataminer.services account — whether because of personal preferences, an email domain change, or any other reason — you will need to re-register by creating a new dataminer.services account.

## Re-registering

> [!TIP]
> For more information on how to access dataminer.services, see [How to access dataminer.services](https://dataminer.services/make-an-account/access_dcp.html).

1. Go to [dataminer.services](https://dataminer.services/).

1. Make sure you are logged out by clicking the user icon in the top-right corner and selecting *Sign out*.

1. Create a new dataminer.services account (make sure to use the new email address), by following the instructions under [Logging on to dataminer.services](xref:Logging_on_to_dataminer_services#logging-on).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since this new account is not linked to the old one, please consider the instructions below to ensure continued access to services and data.

## Ensuring continued access to services and data

> [!NOTE]
> The instructions below are organized by service/feature. Please note that not all instructions may be applicable to your specific usage.

### Regaining access to dataminer.services features

If your dataminer.services account was previously given access to dataminer.services features for an organization via the **Admin app**, this will need to be done again for the new dataminer.services account.

For information on how to do so, see [Managing dataminer.services users](xref:Managing_dataminer_services_users).

> [!TIP]
>
> - For more information about the Admin app, refer to [About the Admin app](xref:About_the_Admin_app).
> - Direct link to Admin app: [admin.dataminer.services](https://admin.dataminer.services/)

### Linking to your DataMiner account

If your dataminer.services account was previously linked to your DataMiner account, you will need to create this link again.

For information on how to do so, see [Linking your DataMiner account to your dataminer.services account](xref:Linking_your_DataMiner_and_dataminer_services_account).

### Regaining access to projects via the Collaboration app

To maintain access to your projects and tasks via the Collaboration app, your new dataminer.services account will need to be linked to the correct organization. This is something that will need to be done by Skyline staff upon request.

To have your new account linked to the correct organization, after you have logged on to [collaboration.dataminer.services](https://collaboration.dataminer.services/) with your new account, contact [back.office@skyline.be](mailto:back.office@skyline.be) to request this.

### Transferring data on DataMiner Community (Dojo)

Upon logging on to Dojo with your new account, you will notice that a new account has been created. Data from your old account are not automatically transferred. This includes your badges, Dojo credits, reputation points, DevOps points, DevOps rank, questions, answers, posts, and feature requests. If you want to transfer the data from your old account, you will need to contact Skyline. However, note that if you opt for the transfer, your old account will be deleted.

If you want to transfer your data, after you have logged on to [community.dataminer.services](https://community.dataminer.services/) with your new account, contact [back.office@skyline.be](mailto:back.office@skyline.be?subject=Request%20to%20transfer%20my%20DataMiner%20Dojo%20data&body=Hi%2C%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20transfer%20my%20DataMiner%20Dojo%20data.%0D%0AThe%20accounts%20involved%20are%20listed%20below%3A%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom%3A%0D%0A%3Cfill%20in%20email%20address%3E%0D%0A%0D%0ATo%20(new%20account)%3A%0D%0A%3Cfill%20in%20email%20address%3E%0D%0A) to request to transfer your existing data. However, because some limitations apply (as detailed below), you will need to confirm before the transfer goes ahead.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some limitations apply to what kind of data can be transferred:
>
> - Any progress you have made on courses and quizzes in the [Learning module](https://community.dataminer.services/learning/) is non-transferable and will be lost, so you will need to start over in this module.
> - Any comments you have made in the [Questions module](https://community.dataminer.services/questions/) will still be displayed as posted with your old account.
