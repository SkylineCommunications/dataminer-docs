# User-defined APIs tutorials

With the DataMiner User-Defined APIs module, you can create custom APIs to interact with DataMiner. The tutorials in this section will show you how to set up a custom API and how to use it.

## Prerequisites

- A DataMiner System using DataMiner 10.3.6 or higher with [Storage as a Service](xref:STaaS) or self-hosted storage setup with [indexing database](xref:Indexing_Database), as well as [HTTPS setup](xref:Setting_up_HTTPS_on_a_DMA)
- [DataMiner Cube](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-cube-installer/)
- [User-Defined APIs user permissions](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#modules--user-defined-apis)
- [Automation user permissions](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#modules--automation)
- [Visual Studio 2019 or later with DataMiner Integration Studio 2.42+](xref:Installing_and_configuring_the_software)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

## Tutorials

- [Hello world](xref:UD_APIs_Hello_world_tutorial)
- [Retrieving elements in alarm](xref:UD_APIs_Elements_in_alarm_tutorial)

> [!NOTE]
> The Automation script solution that is created and used in the tutorials is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/SkylineCommunications/SLC-UDAPI-Documentation-Tutorial-Scripts). The API scripts can also be deployed directly to a DataMiner System [connected to dataminer.services](xref:AboutCloudPlatform) using the corresponding [DataMiner Catalog item](https://catalog.dataminer.services/catalog/5162).

> [!TIP]
>
> - You can also find some basic examples on the [API script examples page](xref:UD_APIs_API_script_examples).
> - Is something not going right while you follow one of these tutorials? Check out our [troubleshooting guide](xref:UD_APIs_Troubleshooting).
