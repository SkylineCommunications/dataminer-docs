# Installation and configuration of a spectrum analyzer

Installing and configuring a spectrum analyzer in your DataMiner System involves [establishing a connection between the spectrum analyzer and DataMiner](xref:Connecting_spectrum_analyzers_to_your_DataMiner_System) through a GPIB gateway or direct TCP/IP interface. For GPIB connections, the [Keysight/Agilent IO Libraries need to be installed and configured](xref:Installing_the_Keysight_Agilent_IO_Libraries), enabling seamless communication.

Additionally, when creating a spectrum analyzer element, you will need to [specify the connection settings of the GPIB/LAN gateway](xref:GPIB_Connection).
