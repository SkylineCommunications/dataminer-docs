# DataMiner Spectrum Analysis

DataMiner Spectrum Analysis allows operators to integrate spectrum analyzers from any vendor in DataMiner, so that they can be deployed for around-the-clock RF performance monitoring. Typically, a spectrum analyzer will be combined with an RF switch to be able to measure at different points in the system, using a single spectrum analyzer.

In DataMiner, a real-time interface allows operators to perform RF measurements remotely. A single spectrum analyzer can also be shared by multiple concurrent users who can each apply their own settings and preferences without any constraints or conflicts.
