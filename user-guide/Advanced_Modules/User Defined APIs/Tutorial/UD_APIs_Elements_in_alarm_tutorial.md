# Elements in alarm tutorial

> [!WARNING]
> It's highly recommended to first do the [Hello world tutorial](xref:UD_APIs_Hello_world_tutorial) before starting this tutorial. This tutorial continues to build on the knowledge of the first tutorial.

In this tutorial we'll build a more realistic use-case for an API. This API will return elements in a specific alarm state that we will pas as input. We will process and validate the input, get all the elements in a specific alarm state, and return them as a json response.
