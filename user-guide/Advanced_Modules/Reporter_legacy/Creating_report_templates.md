# Creating report templates

It is possible to create new custom report templates in the Reporter app.

More information about this can be found in the following sections:

- [Accessing the report templates](xref:Accessing_the_report_templates)

- [Adding a new report template](xref:Adding_a_new_report_template)

These report templates can then be used to:

- Generate reports with the Reporter app. See [Report template components](xref:Report_template_components).

- Send email reports with other DataMiner apps. See [Sending reports by email](xref:Sending_reports_by_email).
