# About DMS Reporter

DMS Reporter is a powerful, web-based tool that allows you to generate graphical reports showing a multitude of statistical data and operational metrics.

With a click of a button, you can get an overview of the top ten devices generating the majority of alarm messages, detailed information about the duration of alarm events, the distribution of alarms over time, etc.

In addition, thanks to a comprehensive library of JScript functions, report data can be incorporated into any existing third-party web environment. This allows operators to e.g. publish network management information onto intranet web pages (customer support, back office, etc.) without the need to grant the users access to the actual network management environment.

The reports generated by DMS Reporter will very often be forwarded by email at regular intervals (weekly, monthly, etc.). However, they can also be sent by DataMiner Correlation upon detection of a particular event within the DataMiner System, or by DataMiner Automation as part of an Automation script.

> [!NOTE]
> You need a specific license to view DataMiner reports. If you do not have this license and try to view a report, a message about the missing license will be displayed instead.
