# Adding a new report template

To add a new report template in the Reporter app:

1. On the report templates page, click *add new report*.

1. Enter the template name and the template description.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - The template name should never contain two percentage (“%”) signs.
   > - The description you enter here will appear on the actual report.

1. Select the template type:

   - One single element/service, or

   - Multiple elements/services.

1. In the *Navigation Menu* box, select one of the following options:

   - **Not Displayed**: The report template will not be shown in the Reports & Dashboards navigation menu.

   - **Link to Template**: In the Reports & Dashboards navigation menu, a link to the report template will be shown.

   - **Link to Report**: In the Reports & Dashboards navigation menu, a link to the report itself will be shown.

1. Click *View advanced options* to configure the following advanced options:

   - If you want the report to use the element descriptions instead of the element names, select *Use element descriptions instead of names*.

   - To sort elements in the report, select *Sort elements*.

   - To use an alternative header in the report, select *Use alternative header*. The alternate header contains only the company logo.

     > [!NOTE]
     > The default header mentions the company data specified in your DMS. For more information on how to change this information, see [Specifying your company data](xref:Specifying_your_company_data).

   - To attach a spreadsheet document to the report, select *Attach Excel/OpenDocument Spreadsheet*. This .ods document will contain a separate worksheet for every table or graph in the report.

   - To attach a zip file with a .csv export for each table or graph in the report, select *Attach CSV data files*.

   - If you selected the template type *Multiple elements/services*, to make sure elements without data are not shown, select *Hide elements without data*.

1. In the *Template Layout* section, add the necessary building blocks and configure their settings.

   - To add a building block, select one from the list and click *Add Block*. For more information on the building blocks, see [Report template components](xref:Report_template_components).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Make sure you have chosen the correct template type before you start adding building blocks to the report (see step 3). If you change the template type afterwards, any building blocks you have added will be removed.

1. If necessary, change the order of the added building blocks by clicking the upward or downward pointing arrows in the top-right corner of each building block.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you want to remove a building block, click the X in the top-right corner of the building block.

1. When the report template is ready, click *Save Template*.
