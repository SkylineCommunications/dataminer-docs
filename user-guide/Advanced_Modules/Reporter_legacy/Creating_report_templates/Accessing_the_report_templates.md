# Accessing the report templates

To go to the report templates page:

1. Open the Reporter app:

   - In DataMiner Cube, go to *Apps* > *Reports & Dashboards*, or

   - Go directly to the link`https://[MyDataMiner]/reports` or `http://[MyDataMiner]/reports`, depending on your setup.

     > [!CAUTION]
     > If you use a DataMiner version prior to DataMiner 10.1.7, we strongly advise that you use HTTPS when you use DataMiner client applications over public internet. If you do not do so, all information – including logon credentials – is sent as plain, unencrypted text over the internet. From DataMiner 10.1.7 onwards, client-server communication is encrypted by default. See also: [Setting up HTTPS on a DMA](xref:Setting_up_HTTPS_on_a_DMA).

1. In the navigation menu on the left, click *Reports*.

   Alternatively, you can also click the *Templates* tab on the *System* page.

On the report templates page, you can:

- Edit report templates, by clicking the pencil icon in the top-right corner of the template.

- Delete report templates, by clicking the x in the top-right corner of the template.

- Add new report templates. See [Adding a new report template](xref:Adding_a_new_report_template).

- Generate reports based on custom templates. See [Report template components](xref:Report_template_components).

> [!NOTE]
> From DataMiner 9.0.0 onwards, the Reporter user interface functions as a single-page application. This means that when you work with the *http(s)://\[MyDataMiner\]/reports* page, you can bookmark the URL of a particular report, or copy the URL in order to make a direct link to the report, for example in Visual Overview.
