# DataMiner Job Manager

The DataMiner Jobs web app, also known as Job Manager, can be used to create and manage jobs, which are then distributed to SRM applications, so that the necessary bookings can be generated.

This app is available from DataMiner 9.6.4 onwards.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - A Cassandra database and Elasticsearch database are required in order to run this app. See [Databases](xref:databases).
> - This app requires a separate Job Manager license.
> - You can access this app using Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox or Safari.
> - If you downgrade from DataMiner 10.0.4 to an earlier DataMiner version, job information may be lost.
> - The Jobs app can also be made available via a gateway server. See [Dashboard Gateway installation](xref:Dashboard_Gateway_installation).
