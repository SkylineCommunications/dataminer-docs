# DataMiner Job Manager

The DataMiner Jobs web app, also known as Job Manager, can be used to create and manage jobs, which are then distributed to SRM applications, so that the necessary bookings can be generated.

You can [access this app](xref:Accessing_the_jobs_app) using Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari.

The Jobs app can also be [made available via a gateway server](xref:Dashboard_Gateway_installation).

In order to run this app, your DataMiner System must use a setup with a Cassandra and Elasticsearch database or an equivalent. For more information, see [Supported system data storage architectures](xref:Supported_system_data_storage_architectures).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Along with the other DataMiner web apps, you can upgrade the Jobs app separately from your main DataMiner installation. This means that you can for example have a DataMiner System using version 10.3.4, while you already use version 10.3.5 for the web apps. You can [download the web apps upgrade package from DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/downloads/).
> - This app requires a separate Job Manager license.
> - If you downgrade from DataMiner 10.0.4 to an earlier DataMiner version, job information may be lost.

> [!CAUTION]
> The Jobs app is being retired. See [DataMiner functionality evolution and retirement](xref:Software_support_life_cycles) for more details. ![EOL](~/user-guide/images/EOL_Duo.png)
