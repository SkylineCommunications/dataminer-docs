# Manually adding a job

To manually add a job in the Jobs app:

1. In the header bar of the main page of the app, click *New*.

1. Fill in the necessary fields. Which fields can or must be filled in depends on your Job Manager configuration, but the following fields are always required:

   - **Name**: The name of the job

   - **Start Time**: Allows you to specify the start time for the job manually, using the spin buttons or using the calendar control.

   - **Stop Time**: Allows you to specify the stop time for the job manually, using the spin buttons or using the calendar control.

   In case a section allows multiple instances, you can add an instance by clicking the “+” icon at the top of the section. You can also duplicate an instance with the ![Duplicate icon](~/user-guide/images/JobsX_duplicate.png) icon. Each instance is represented by a tab in the section. If not all tabs can be displayed, click the downward arrow on the right to select the tab you want to see.

1. When all the necessary fields have been filled in, click *Save* in the header bar.
