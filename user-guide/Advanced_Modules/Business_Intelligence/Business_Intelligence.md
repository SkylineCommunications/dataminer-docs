# DataMiner Business Intelligence

With DataMiner Business Intelligence, you can manage services from a value-added business perspective, tracking Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance in real time. With SLA elements that correspond to particular services, you can view system events in their historical performance context, so that you can take the necessary measures with the business stakes in mind.

SLA elements are created with SLA definitions in XML format. They can be trended and monitored like other DataMiner elements. In the DMS Reports module, specific types of reports are available for them.

> [!NOTE]
> The most commonly used SLA protocol is *Skyline SLA Definition Basic*, which is available in the [DataMiner Catalog](xref:About_the_Catalog_module). Note that versions of this protocol prior to 2.0.0.16 are no longer supported.
