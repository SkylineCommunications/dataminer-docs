# Setting the SLA start and end time

To set the start and end time for the period during which the SLA is valid, do the following:

1. In DataMiner Cube, go to the *SLA Configuration* page of the SLA element.

1. In the *Extra settings* section, under *SLA Validity Start Time*, enter the start time in the format yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss.

   By default, this field will be set to *Since creation*. You can use the checkbox *Since creation* to reset the start time to this default value.

1. In the *Extra settings* section, under *SLA Validity End Time*, enter the end time in the format yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss.

   By default, this field will be set to *Forever*. You can use the checkbox *Forever* to reset the start time to this default value.

1. Confirm your settings.
