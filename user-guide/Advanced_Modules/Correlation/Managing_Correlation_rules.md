# Managing Correlation rules

When you open the Correlation module in Cube (via apps \> *Correlation*), a card is opened that consists of two panes:

- A pane on the left, where all rules are represented in a tree view. A search box at the top of the pane allows you to quickly find a particular rule. Rules that are not enabled are indicated in gray.

- A pane on the right, with details of the selected item in the tree view. If a folder is selected, the rules in the folder are shown, with rules that are not enabled indicated in gray. If a rule is selected, its details can be viewed and edited.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The rule details can also be viewed in a separate card. To do so, right-click the rule and select *Open in new card* or *Open in new undocked card*.

Managing Correlation rules, e.g. adding and deleting rules or organizing them in folders, is done in the pane on the left:

- [Collapsing and expanding folders](xref:Collapsing_and_expanding_folders)

- [Adding a new folder](xref:Adding_a_new_folder)

- [Moving rules or folders](xref:Moving_rules_or_folders)

- [Deleting a rule or folder](xref:Deleting_a_rule_or_folder)

- [Renaming a folder](xref:Renaming_a_folder)

- [Adding a new Correlation rule](xref:Adding_a_new_Correlation_rule)

- [Testing a Correlation rule](xref:Testing_a_Correlation_rule)

> [!NOTE]
> To enable or disable a rule, select the rule in the tree view, and then either select or clear the checkbox next to *Enable this rule*, in the top-left corner of the pane on the right.
