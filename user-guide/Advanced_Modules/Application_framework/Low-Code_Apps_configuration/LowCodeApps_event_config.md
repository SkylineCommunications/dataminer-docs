# Configuring low-code app events

At present two types of events can be configured in the DataMiner Low-Code Apps:

- *On page load*: This event takes place when a page is loaded. (See [Configuring a page of a low-code app](xref:LowCodeApps_page_config).)
- *On click*: This event takes place when a user clicks a button. (See [Configuring the header bar of a low-code app page](xref:LowCodeApps_header_config).)

For each of these events, you can configure actions as detailed below.

> [!TIP]
> Actions can be combined and chained to create more complex behavior. For example, an *Open a page* action can be followed by an *Open a panel* action to open a panel on a specific page. While the panel is being opened, a *Launch a script* action can execute an Automation script that updates parameters that will be displayed on that panel. All of this can be triggered from a header bar button, for example on the initial page.

## Launching a script

To configure an event to launch a script:

1. Select *Launch a script* and select the script.

1. If the script requires input such as dummies and parameters, configure these as well.

   When applicable, the *Use feed* checkbox allows you to link a parameter to an existing feed.

1. Optionally, click the *Show settings* button to configure [script execution options](xref:Script_execution_options).

## Navigating to a URL

To configure an event to navigate to a URL:

1. Select *Navigate to a URL* and specify the URL.

1. Optionally, to open the webpage in a new tab, enable the option *Open in new tab*.

## Opening a page of the app

To configure an event to open another page of the app:

- Select *Open a page* and select the page.

## Opening a panel of the app

To configure an event to open a panel of the app:

1. select *Open a panel* and select the panel.

1. In the *Where* box, select where the panel should be opened: in a pop-up window, on the left, or on the right.

1. In the *Width* box, specify the width of the panel (in %) compared to the rest of the app.

1. If the panel should be opened as an overlay, toggle the *As overlay* button.

   If a panel is opened as an overlay, the background for the panel is slightly blurred, and the panel is automatically hidden as soon as the user clicks outside it.

## Closing a panel of the app

To configure an event to close a panel of the app:

1. Select *Close a panel* and select the panel.

1. In the *Where* box, select where the panel that should be closed is located: in a pop-up window, on the left, or on the right. This is necessary in case the same panel is opened multiple times in different places.

## Opening an app

To configure an event to open another low-code app that has been published in your DMS:

- Select *Open an app* and select the app.

  > [!NOTE]
  > *Drafts* apps are included in the list of apps you can select.

## Opening a monitoring card

Available from DataMiner 10.3.4/10.4.0 onwards<!-- RN 35661 -->. To configure an event to open a monitoring card of a specific element, service, or view:

1. Select *Open monitoring card*.

1. In the *Type* box, select a type: element, service, or view.

1. Based on the selected type, select the element, service, or view for which the monitoring card should be opened.

   > [!NOTE]
   > From DataMiner 10.3.5/10.4.0 onwards<!--  RN 35986 -->, instead of linking to a fixed element, service, or view, you can link to a feed. To do so, click the link icon to the right of the selection box, select the feed, and click *Apply*.

1. Select *Add action*.

> [!NOTE]
> When a low-code app is embedded in Cube (e.g. in Visual Overview), an *Open monitoring card* action will open the specified card in Cube.

## Executing a component action

This option is only displayed if there is a component action that can be executed.

To configure an event to execute a component action:

1. Select *Execute component action* and specify which action should be executed.

Examples:

- If you configure this action for a [Table](xref:DashboardTable) component, you can select the options *Clear selection*, *Fetch the data*, or *Select an item*. Or from DataMiner 10.2.10/10.3.0 onwards, you can select *Fetch the data* for any component that uses query data as input, so that users can manually refresh the displayed data.

- From DataMiner 10.3.5/10.4.0 onwards<!--  RN 35933 -->, if you add a line chart component and a button component, you can configure this action on the button and select the option *Set timespan*, so that users can use the button to set the timespan for the line chart. The action has two arguments, To and From, which can be either set to a static value or linked to a numeric value feed.

## Configuring another action for the same event

After you have configured an action, you can click *Upon completion* to configure another action that should occur as soon as the previous action is completed.

Alternatively, you can configure another action that should happen at the same time with the *Add action* button in the lower right corner.

## Removing an action

To remove an action you have configured for an event:

1. In the action configuration window, click the garbage can icon in the top-right corner of the section for that action.

1. Click the confirmation icon.
