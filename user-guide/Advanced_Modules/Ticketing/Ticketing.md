# DataMiner Ticketing

The Ticketing app, also known as DataMiner Ticketing, allows you to easily create and manage tickets in DataMiner. The app is available both embedded within DataMiner Cube and as a standalone web app.

You can [access this app](xref:Accessing_the_Ticketing_app) using Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari.

The Ticketing app can also be [made available via a gateway server](xref:Dashboard_Gateway_installation).

In order to run this app, your DataMiner System must use a setup with a Cassandra and Elasticsearch database or an equivalent. For more information, see [Supported system data storage architectures](xref:Supported_system_data_storage_architectures).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Along with the other DataMiner web apps, you can upgrade the Ticketing app separately from your main DataMiner installation. This means that you can for example have a DataMiner System using version 10.3.4, while you already use version 10.3.5 for the web apps. You can [download the web apps upgrade package from DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/downloads/).
> - The Ticketing app requires a separate license. For more information on acquiring a Ticketing license, contact the Skyline Sales department.

> [!CAUTION]
> The Ticketing app is being retired. See [DataMiner functionality evolution and retirement](xref:Software_support_life_cycles) for more details. ![EOL](~/user-guide/images/EOL_Duo.png)
