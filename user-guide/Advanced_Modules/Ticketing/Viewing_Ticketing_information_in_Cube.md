# Viewing Ticketing information in Cube

On a DMA where the Ticketing module has been activated, additional ticketing information is available on cards and in the Alarm Console:

- An additional *Tickets* page is available on each element, service and view card. Next to the name of this page, the number of tickets for the item in question is displayed.

    This page has a subpage for each domain configured on the DMA. Next to the name of each subpage, the number of tickets for this item in this domain is displayed.

- To view ticketing information in the Alarm Console, right-click the column header of the Alarm Console tab, and select *Add/Remove column* > *Ticket* > *\[Domain name\]* > *\[Field name\]*. The domain and field names depend on the Ticketing configuration of your DMA.

> [!NOTE]
> The web browser engine that is used to display Ticketing pop-up windows depends on the default web browser engine configuration in Cube. See [Changing the default browser engine used in DataMiner Cube](xref:Changing_the_default_browser_engine_used_in_DataMiner_Cube).
