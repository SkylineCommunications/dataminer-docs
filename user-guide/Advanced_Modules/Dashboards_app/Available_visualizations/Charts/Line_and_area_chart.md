# Line & area chart

This component can be used to display a trend graph.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - From DataMiner 10.0.11 onwards, if this type of component is added, the time span displayed by the component is available as a feed in the data pane, so that this can be applied to other components.
> - From DataMiner 10.2.0 [CU10]/10.3.1 onwards, this component also supports line graphs for string parameters.

## Configuration

To configure the component:

1. Apply one or more parameter data feeds. See [Applying a data feed](xref:Configuring_dashboard_components#applying-a-data-feed).

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - If a query is used as the data feed, additional configuration is required. See [Configuration with query data feed](#configuration-with-query-data-feed).
   > - Prior to DataMiner 10.2.0 [CU10]/10.3.1, you can use a table component to feed a line chart by linking the *Parameters* feed and the *Indices* feed. From DataMiner 10.2.0 [CU10]/10.3.1 onwards, you only need to link the *Parameters* feed of the table to the line chart in order to see the data, similar to when you use a [parameter feed component](xref:DashboardParameterFeed).

1. Optionally, apply a filter feed:

   - In case a parameter data feed included a parameter based on a protocol, a filter feed can be used to filter on a specific element.

   - For a table parameter, an *indices* filter feed is supported.

   - From DataMiner 10.0.2 onwards, in a system using Service & Resource Management, you can add resources as a feed to make the graph display the resource capacity parameters as a stacked trend chart. If you then click the chart and select a point in time, the legend lists all bookings for that specific point in time. See [Service and Resource Management](xref:SRM#service-and-resource-management).

   - From DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.3 onwards, a parameter table filter feed is supported if the URL option showAdvancedSettings=true is used. This type of filter supports both VALUE and FULLFILTER syntax. For more information on this syntax, see [Dynamic table filter syntax](xref:Dynamic_table_filter_syntax).

     > [!NOTE]
     > When you update a filter that is already used in the component, re-add the filter in order to update it in the component.

   - From DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.4 onwards, you can select view parameters as a data source to view trending for aggregation rules on specific views. To select these, in the drop-down box for the parameter data source, select *View*.

1. Optionally, customize the following component options in the *Component* > *Settings* tab:

   - *WebSocket settings*: Allows you to customize the polling interval for this component. To do so, clear the checkbox in this section and specify the custom polling interval.

   - *Trend span*: Allows you to customize the time span for which trending is displayed. You can either select a predefined time span or select *Custom* and specify a start and end time.

   - *Value range* > *Fixed minimum*/*Fixed Maximum*: Available from DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards. These settings allow you to configure a minimum and/or maximum range for the chart, so that no values outside this range are displayed. The configured range will apply to all lines in the chart, regardless of any particular axis or displayed parameter. By default, no limits are applied.

   - *Minimum visible gap size*: Allows you to specify the minimum duration a gap must have before it is displayed in the graph. By default, this is set to 0.

   - *Trend points*: Available from DataMiner 10.2.0/10.2.3 onwards. Determines which type of trend data points are added to the graph: *Average (changes only)*, *Average (fixed interval)*, or *Real-time*. By default, *Average (changes only)* is selected. This setting will also be taken into account when you export the chart to CSV.

   - *Show real-time trend data*: If real-time trending is available, this box allows you to set the chart to display real-time trending instead of average trending.

   - *Show average*: Available from DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards, if *Show real-time trend data* is not selected. Displays the average trend data. By default, this is enabled.

   - *Show minimum*: Available from DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards, if *Show real-time trend data*/Stack trend lines is not selected. Displays the minimum trend data. By default, this is disabled.

   - *Show maximum*: Available from DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards, if *Show real-time trend data*/Stack trend lines is not selected. Displays the maximum trend data. By default, this is disabled.

   - *Group by*: In case the component displays trending for multiple parameters, this box allows you to specify how the graphs should be grouped. One graph will be displayed per group. The default setting (from DataMiner 10.3.2/10.4.0 onwards<!-- RN 35160 -->) is *All together*.

     > [!NOTE]
     > View parameters can only be grouped together with other parameters with the option *All together*, otherwise they are placed in a separate group.

   - *Use percentage based values*: This option is only displayed if the component displays resource capacity information. If you select this option, the chart will display percentage values instead of absolute values.

1. Optionally, fine-tune the component layout. In the *Component* > *Layout* tab, the following options are available:

   - The default options available for all components. See [Customizing the component layout](xref:Configuring_dashboard_components#customizing-the-component-layout).

   - *Layout*: In case the component will display multiple trend charts, this section allows you to configure how these charts are displayed:

     - *Type*: Determines whether the different charts are displayed next to each other or below each other. However, note that when the charts are viewed on a small screen, they will always be displayed below each other.

     - *Maximum rows per page*: Determines how many charts can at most be displayed below each other on a single page.

     - *Maximum columns per page*: Determines how many charts can at most be displayed next to each other on a single page.

     - *Chart limit*: Determines how many parameters can at most be displayed in one chart. By default, this is set to 16 parameters.

     - *Chart limit behavior*: Available from DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards. Determines what happens when the number of parameters in the chart exceeds the defined chart limit:

       - *Disable parameters in legend*: The excess parameters are disabled in the chart but remain available in the chart legend, so that they can be enabled again manually. This option is selected by default, and is also the default behavior prior to DataMiner 10.0.13.

       - *Create additional charts*: Additional charts are displayed that include the parameters that exceed the limit. If necessary, multiple additional charts will be displayed, each respecting the configured limit.

   - *Styling and Information* > *Show range selector*: Determines whether a preview graph is displayed below the main graph, allowing you to easily select a different range.

   - *Styling and Information* > *Line thickness*: Allows you to specify the thickness of the data line in the chart (in pixels).

   - *Styling and Information* > *Highlight lines on hover*: Available from DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.1 onwards. Determines whether a trend line is highlighted when you hover over the line in the graph or over the corresponding parameter in the trend legend. When a line is highlighted, it gets the thickness determined by the *Highlight line thickness* setting, which becomes available when this option is selected.

     > [!NOTE]
     > If you hover over a parameter in the trend legend, lines on different charts with this same parameter name will also be highlighted. This can be useful to easily compare related lines in different charts.

   - *Styling and Information* > *Enable legend*: Allows you to disable the legend for the line chart. This is especially used for line charts within Group components, in order to avoid duplicate legends.

   - *Styling and Information* > *Expand legend initially*: Select this option to immediately show the trend legend in the component. Otherwise, the legend section is initially collapsed, and you can display it using the arrow icon next to the graph.

   - *Styling and Information* > *Hide parameters without trend data in the legend*: Available from DataMiner 10.0.9 onwards. Determines whether parameters are shown in the legend of the graph if they have no trend data available. By default, this option is selected, so that these parameters are hidden.

   - *Fill graph*: Available from DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.6 onwards. Select this option to have the space underneath the line filled with the line color.

   - *Stack trend lines*: Available from DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.6 onwards. Select this option to stack the lines in the graph on top of each other. This option is not compatible with the *Show min/max shading*, *Show minimum* and *Show maximum* options. When you select the *Stack trend lines* option, those options will therefore be disabled and hidden.

   - *Styling and Information* > *Show min/max shading*: Select this option to display a semi-transparent shade above and below the trend line, showing the minimum and maximum trend values. This option can only be used for parameters with average trending and only in case the Y-axis has no discrete values.

   - *Additional lines* > *Line thickness*: If you select to show any additional lines with the options below, this option becomes available, allowing you to customize the thickness of these lines (in pixels).

   - *Additional lines* > *Show percentile*: Displays a percentile line on the graph. When you select this option, two additional options become available that allow you to configure this percentile line: *Percentile*, which allows you to indicate which percentile should be displayed, and *Percentile line color*.

     > [!NOTE]
     > From DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.1 onwards, the percentile calculation takes into account how long the parameter had a specific value. This means that if a particular value is present for a longer time than other values, it will get more weight in the calculation. For discrete parameters or graphs showing multiple parameters, no percentile is calculated.

   - *Additional lines* > *Show boundary lines*: Allows you to display one or more boundary lines. You can configure where a line should be displayed by adding a Y-axis value in the *Boundary value* box. The color of a boundary line can be customized in the *Boundary line color* box. The *Add boundary line* option below this allows you to add additional boundary lines. To remove a boundary line, click the x to the right of the line name.

## Configuration with query data feed

Query results are supported as a data feed for this component from DataMiner 10.2.9/10.3.0 onwards. To configure the component to use a GQI query as its data feed:

1. Create a query data feed. See [Configuring query data feeds](xref:Configuring_GQI_feeds).

1. In the *Component* > *Settings* tab, configure the following fields in the *Dimensions* section:

   - *Query*: The query data feed you want to use.
   - *X axis*: The column that should be used for the X-axis data.
   - *Y axis*: The column that should be used for the Y-axis data.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Data points are connected by a line in the order they appear in the query result. If you want to create a trend line, make sure the query results are sorted on the desired axis column.

1. Fine-tune the component layout and settings like for a regular line and area chart. See [Configuration](#configuration).

## Export to CSV

From DataMiner 9.6.13 onwards, it is possible to export the trend data to CSV. To do so, click the ... icon in the top-right corner of the component and select *Export to CSV*. The CSV file will then be generated in the background. To ensure that it is generated correctly, do not change the configuration of the component until the CSV export is completed.

> [!NOTE]
> The separator used in CSV exports is based on the *CSV separator* setting in Cube. If this setting cannot be retrieved, the local browser settings are used instead.
