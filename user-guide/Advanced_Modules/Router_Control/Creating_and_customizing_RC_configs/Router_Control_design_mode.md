# Router Control design mode

To enter or to exit the design mode of the Router Control module, click the large cogwheel icon in the top-right corner.

In design mode, there are three panes:

- On the left, there is a list of building blocks that you can use to create a custom configuration.

- In the middle, there is a design area (which initially contains the default Router Control configuration).

- On the right, there is a hierarchical list of building blocks used in the current configuration.

  Any item that is clicked in the design area is automatically also selected in the list on the right.

- In the lower right corner, the properties of a selected item can be configured.
