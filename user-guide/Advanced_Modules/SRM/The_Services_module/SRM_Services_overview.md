# Using the overview tab

The *overview* tab (from DataMiner 10.0.8 onwards) or *services* tab (prior to DataMiner 10.0.8) of the Services module lists all services in a dynamic, filterable list view with a default set of columns.

The list is similar to a list view component in Visual Overview. For more information on how to work with this list, see [Customizing a list view in DataMiner Cube](xref:Creating_a_list_view#customizing-a-list-view-in-dataminer-cube).
