# The Resources module

On systems with the necessary SRM licenses, the *Resources* module in Cube can be used to get an overview of the available resources and resource pools in the system and to configure these.

> [!NOTE]
> This module requires [STaaS](xref:STaaS) (recommended) or a [self-hosted DataMiner storage setup](xref:Supported_system_data_storage_architectures) with Cassandra-compatible database and indexing database.
