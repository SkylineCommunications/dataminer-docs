# Bar chart (horizontal)

Deprecated since DataMiner 10.0.13.

This chart is the same as the regular bar chart, except that the bars are displayed horizontally.

Aside from the option to stack the bars, which is not available for the horizontal bar chart, it features the same options as the vertical bar chart.

However, note that any features that have been added to the regular bar chart component since DataMiner 10.0.13 are not included in this component. As it is possible to display the regular bar chart component with horizontal bars from that DataMiner version onwards, the Bar chart (horizontal) component will become obsolete.

For more information, see [Column & Bar chart](xref:ColumnAndBarChart).
