# Feeds

Feeds can be added to a dashboard to allow a user to select a DataMiner object for which information can be displayed in other components.

The following types of feeds are available:

- [CPE feed](xref:DashboardCPEFeed)

- [List](xref:DashboardListFeed)

- [Parameter feed](xref:DashboardParameterFeed)

- [Time range](xref:DashboardTimeRangeFeed)

- [Tree](xref:DashboardTreeFeed)

- [Trigger](xref:DashboardTriggerFeed)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Feeds can be pre-configured in dashboard URLs. See [Specifying data input in a dashboard URL](xref:Specifying_data_input_in_a_dashboard_URL).
> - The [Dropdown](xref:DashboardDropdownFeed) visualization is also a type of feed, but from DataMiner 10.3.5/10.4.0 onwards<!--  RN 35902 -->, it is available under *Basic controls* instead.
