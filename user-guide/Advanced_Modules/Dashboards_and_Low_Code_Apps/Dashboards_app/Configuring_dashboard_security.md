# Configuring security for a dashboard

> [!NOTE]
> The information on this page only applies from DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7]/10.4.10 onwards.<!--RN 40501--> For earlier DataMiner versions, dashboard security is configured in the *Settings* pane of a dashboard in edit mode. See [Changing dashboard settings](xref:Changing_dashboard_settings).

User permissions can be customized for both dashboard folders and individual dashboards, allowing you to restrict access and prevent unauthorized modifications.

> [!TIP]
> See also: [Kata #44: Master Dashboard user permissions](https://community.dataminer.services/courses/kata-44/) on DataMiner Dojo ![Video](~/user-guide/images/video_Duo.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Restricting access to dashboards does not imply any restrictions on the underlying data. For this, the access rights on the corresponding data sources should be configured in DataMiner Cube. See [User rights](xref:User_rights).

To configure which users can access and/or edit a folder or dashboard:

1. Right-click the folder or dashboard in the list pane and select *Settings*.

1. Under *Access*, determine which users and groups are allowed to view and/or edit the folder or dashboard. You can configure access for specific users, groups, or everyone.

   - The *Everyone* field is always available. This determines the access level for all users who have the [General > DataMiner web apps](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#general--dataminer-web-apps) user permission.

   - Click *Add user/group*, and enter the names of specific users and/or groups to give them permission to view or edit the folder/dashboard. Then, assign them an appropriate access level.

   - When you have added a user or group, you can always remove them again with the garbage can icon.

   The available access levels are:

   - *No access*: Users cannot view or edit the dashboard folder or dashboard. The folder/dashboard will be hidden from the [Dashboards app sidebar](xref:Overview_of_the_Dashboards_app_UI#the-dashboards-app-sidebar) and will be inaccessible even with a direct link. This option is only available in the dropdown menu next to *Everyone*.

   - *Viewer*: Users can view the folder or dashboard. They can interact with dashboard components, but they cannot make any modifications to dashboard components or settings. For a folder, they are also unable to add new dashboards to the folder or change folder settings.

   - *Editor*: Users can view and edit the folder or dashboard. For a folder, they can add and remove dashboards, rename them, and edit settings. However, they can only rename or move the folder itself if they also have editor rights to the parent folder.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - If *Everyone* is set to *No access*, you must assign at least one user or group as an editor to keep the folder/dashboard functional. If you do not add your own user account as an editor, you will lose the ability to make further changes to the folder or dashboard.
   > - If a user has been given an access level both as an individual and as part of a group, the level with the most privileges is the one that counts.
   > - Granting a user *Viewer* rights to a folder allows them to view all subfolders and dashboards within. However, granting a user *Editor* rights to a folder does not automatically grant them edit rights to subfolders and dashboards within.
   > - The built-in Administrator account always has full access to all dashboards.

## Special combinations of privileges

Certain combinations of privileges may lead to specific behaviors in terms of what users can or cannot do. Below are some common scenarios:

- *Viewer* rights to parent folder and *Editor* rights to child folder: Users can create new dashboards or folders within the child folder.

- *Viewer* rights to parent folder and *Editor* rights to dashboards within: Users can edit specific dashboards within the parent folder.

- *Viewer* rights to parent folder and *No access* rights to dashboards within: Users cannot see the restricted dashboards within the parent folder.

- *Editor* rights to parent folder and *Viewer* rights to dashboards within: Users can view the dashboards without making changes. They also cannot rename, move, or delete the dashboards. However, they can create and edit new dashboards within the parent folder.

- *Editor* rights to parent folder and *Viewer* rights to a child folder: Users cannot create new dashboards or subfolders in the child folder. They can delete, move, or rename the child folder and all dashboards directly within the parent folder.
