# Dashboards app

With the Dashboards app, you can make, manage, and view dashboards that can display a wealth of information about the monitored system. You can [share your dashboards](xref:Sharing_a_dashboard) with just about anyone via dataminer.services, or [create a PDF report](xref:Generating_a_report_based_on_a_dashboard_Cube) based on them.

Many different [visualizations](xref:Available_visualizations) are available, which can make use of all sorts of [data feeds](xref:Using_dashboard_feeds), including [GQI-based query feeds](xref:Creating_GQI_query).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Along with the other DataMiner web apps, you can upgrade the Dashboards app separately from your main DataMiner installation. This means that you can for example have a DataMiner System using version 10.3.4, while you already use version 10.3.5 for the web apps. You can [download the web apps upgrade package from DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/downloads/).
> - A legacy DMS Dashboards module also exists. For more information, see [DMS Dashboards](xref:dashboards).
