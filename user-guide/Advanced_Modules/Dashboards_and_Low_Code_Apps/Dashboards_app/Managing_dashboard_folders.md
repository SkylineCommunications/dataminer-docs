# Managing dashboard folders

## Adding a folder

1. In case you want to create the folder within an existing folder, select that existing folder. Otherwise, make sure no folder is selected. You can do so by clicking the *Dashboards* button in the header bar.

1. Either right-click the dashboards list or click the ... button in the top-right corner of the list and select *New folder*.

1. Specify the name of the folder and click *OK*.

> [!NOTE]
> The following characters are not allowed in a dashboard folder name:
>
> / \\ : ; \* ? \< \> \| °
>
> If you do specify a backslash (“\\”) in the folder name, this will not become part of the folder name. Instead a subfolder will be created, with the characters after the backslash as its name.

## Deleting a folder

1. Select the folder in the navigation pane.

1. Either right-click the folder in the dashboards list or click the ... button in the top-right corner of the list and select *Delete*.

1. Click OK to confirm the deletion.

> [!NOTE]
> - When you delete a folder, any dashboards or folders within that folder will also be deleted.
> - If a folder contains a dashboard you are not allowed to modify, you will not be able to delete that folder.

## Renaming a folder

1. Select the folder in the navigation pane.

1. Either right-click the folder in the dashboards list or click the ... button in the top-right corner of the list and select *Rename*.

1. Enter a new folder name, and click OK.

> [!NOTE]
> - When you rename a folder, the location and URL of all dashboards in that folder and any of its subfolders will automatically be adapted.
> - If a folder contains a dashboard you are not allowed to modify, you will not be able to rename that folder.

## Moving a dashboard to a different folder

This is possible from DataMiner 10.0.0/10.0.2 onwards:

1. Right-click the dashboard in the navigation pane and select *Move*.

   The *Move dashboard* pop-up window will be displayed.

1. Click the *Location* box and either manually specify the new location for the dashboard, or select it in the tree view below.

   You can also create folders at this point, by hovering the mouse pointer over the folder in the tree view where you want to create a folder and clicking the + icon. Then specify the folder name and click the check mark icon.

1. Click *OK*.

> [!NOTE]
> It is not possible to move a dashboard that is currently being shared. To move such a dashboard, you will need to temporarily stop sharing it and then share it again once it has been moved.
