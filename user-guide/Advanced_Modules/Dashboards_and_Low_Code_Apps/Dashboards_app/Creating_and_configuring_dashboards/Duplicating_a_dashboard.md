# Duplicating a dashboard

1. In the list of dashboards on the left, select the dashboard that you want to duplicate.

1. Right-click the dashboard or click the ... button in the top-right corner of the panel, and select *Copy* or *Duplicate*, depending on the DataMiner version.

1. In the dialog box, enter the name of the new dashboard.

1. To modify the folder that should contain the duplicated dashboard, specify the folder name in the *Location* box, or select the folder in the tree view below this box.

   By default, the folder containing the dashboard you duplicated is selected.

   You can also create folders at this point, by hovering the mouse pointer over the folder in the tree view where you want to create a folder and clicking the + icon. Then specify the folder name and click the check mark icon.

1. Click *OK*.

> [!NOTE]
> The following characters are not allowed in the name of a dashboard or dashboard folder: / \\ : ; \* ? \< \> \| °
>
> If you do specify a backslash (“\\”) in a folder name, this will not become part of the folder name. Instead, a subfolder will be created, with the characters after the backslash as its name.
