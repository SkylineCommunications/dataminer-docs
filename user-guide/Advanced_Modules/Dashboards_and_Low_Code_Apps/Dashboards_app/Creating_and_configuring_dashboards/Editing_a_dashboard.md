# Editing a dashboard

To edit an existing dashboard:

1. Select the dashboard in the list pane.

1. In the dashboard header bar, click the pencil icon.

   - To change one of the existing components into a different component, hover the mouse pointer over the component, click the ![Visualizations icon](~/user-guide/images/DashboardsX_visualizations.png) icon, and select a different visualization below the icon.

   - To change the data input for an existing component, drag the data from the data panel to the component. For more information, see [Applying a data feed](xref:Configuring_dashboard_components#applying-a-data-feed).

   - To duplicate one of the existing components, hover the mouse pointer over the component and click the ![Duplicate component icon](~/user-guide/images/DashboardsX_duplicate.png) icon.

   - To remove one of the existing components, hover the mouse pointer over the component and click the red recycle bin icon.

   - To move a component, drag and drop it to a different position on the dashboard.

     In case the component contains interactive areas, you can first hover the mouse over the component and then use the ![Drag-and-drop icon](~/user-guide/images/NewRD_dragdrop.png) icon below it to drag and drop the component without clicking it directly.

   - To resize a component, move the mouse pointer to the edge of the component and drag it until the component has the desired size.

   - To view or hide the grid lines of the dashboard while in edit mode, click the *Show grid* or *Hide grid* button in the dashboard header bar. These grid lines show the columns and rows that the components are arranged on.

   - To add a new component, see [Configuring dashboard components](xref:Configuring_dashboard_components).

   - To change the overall layout of the dashboard, see [Configuring the dashboard layout](xref:Configuring_the_dashboard_layout).

1. When ready, click *Stop editing* in the header bar.
