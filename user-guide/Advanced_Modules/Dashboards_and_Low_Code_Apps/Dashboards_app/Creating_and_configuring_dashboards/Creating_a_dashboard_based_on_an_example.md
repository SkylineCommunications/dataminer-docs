# Creating a dashboard based on an example

Instead of creating a dashboard from scratch, you can instead first import an example dashboard and then edit this dashboard. To do so:

1. On the homepage of the app, click *Start with an example dashboard*.

   Alternatively, you can also right-click the list of dashboards on the left (or click the “...” icon in its top-right corner), and select *Import dashboard*.

1. In the pop-up window, next to the dashboard you want to import, click the *Import* button.

1. Optionally, change the name of the dashboard.

1. If you wish to place the dashboard in a particular folder in the list of dashboards, specify the folder name in the *Location* box, or click the box and select the folder in the tree view below it.

   If you right-clicked a particular folder at the start of this procedure, this folder will automatically be selected.

1. In the *Security* box, select whether other users should be able to view and edit the dashboard.

   > [!NOTE]
   > - Once the dashboard has been created, you can further refine which users have which level of access in the dashboard options. See [Changing dashboard settings](xref:Changing_dashboard_settings).
   > - The built-in Administrator account always has full access to all dashboards.

1. Click *OK*.

1. Click the pencil icon in the top-right corner to start editing the example dashboard.

1. Optionally, fine-tune the dashboard settings. See [Changing dashboard settings](xref:Changing_dashboard_settings).

1. Optionally, fine-tune the dashboard layout. See [Configuring the dashboard layout](xref:Configuring_the_dashboard_layout).

1. Configure the necessary components. See [Configuring dashboard components](xref:Configuring_dashboard_components).

1. When the dashboard is ready, in the top-right corner of the screen, click the “x” icon.

> [!NOTE]
> - The following characters are not allowed in the name of a dashboard or dashboard folder: / \\ : ; \* ? \< \> \| °<br>If you do specify a backslash (“\\”) in a folder name, this will not become part of the folder name. Instead a subfolder will be created, with the characters after the backslash as its name.
> - The example dashboards can be found in the folder *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\ImportDashboards* on the server. Any dashboard that is placed in this folder will become available for import.
