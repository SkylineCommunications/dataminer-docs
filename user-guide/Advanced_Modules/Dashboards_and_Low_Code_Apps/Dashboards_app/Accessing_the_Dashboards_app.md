# Accessing the Dashboards app

To access the Dashboards app, depending on your setup, go to one of the following addresses in a browser:

```txt
http://[DMA]/dashboard
https://[DMA]/dashboard
```

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you use Google Chrome to access the Dashboards app. Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari are also supported.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you use a DataMiner version prior to DataMiner 10.1.7, we strongly advise that you use HTTPS when you use DataMiner client applications over public internet. If you do not do so, all information – including logon credentials – is sent as plain, unencrypted text over the internet. From DataMiner 10.1.7 onwards, client-server communication is encrypted by default. See also: [Setting up HTTPS on a DMA](xref:Setting_up_HTTPS_on_a_DMA).
