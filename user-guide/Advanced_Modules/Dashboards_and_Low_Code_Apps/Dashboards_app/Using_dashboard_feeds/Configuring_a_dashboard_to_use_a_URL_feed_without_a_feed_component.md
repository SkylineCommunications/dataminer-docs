# Configuring a dashboard to use a URL feed without a feed component

From DataMiner 10.0.7 onwards, you can link a component to data in the URL without using any feeds on the dashboard.

To do so, when you are configuring the dashboard:

1. Select the component you want to link to a URL feed.

1. In the *Data* tab, go to *Feeds* > *URL*, and drag the URL feed you want to use to the component.

> [!NOTE]
> When the dashboard has a feed that contains the same data as the URL, that feed will overwrite the data from the URL.
