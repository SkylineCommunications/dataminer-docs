# Using dashboard feeds

Many dashboard components can be configured to be linked to a feed, so that their content can be dynamically adjusted by the users.

To have dashboard components updated based on a feed, feed components need to be added in the dashboard. The data input can then either be selected by the user or specified in the dashboard URL.
