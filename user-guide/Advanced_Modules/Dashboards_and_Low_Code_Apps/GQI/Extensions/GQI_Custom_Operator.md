# Configuring a custom operator for a query

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is currently still in preview. For more information, see [Soft-launch options](xref:SoftLaunchOptions).

The custom operator is available in soft launch from DataMiner 10.2.7/10.3.0 onwards, if the soft-launch option *GenericInterface* is enabled.

The custom operator has a [life cycle](xref:CO_Life_cycle) of its own and implements [predefined interfaces to add the desired functionality](xref:CO_Building_blocks).
