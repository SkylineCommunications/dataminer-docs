# Query operators

When you create a query, you can use the operators listed below.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Selecting an operator is optional. If you do not select an operator, the data set will be returned untouched.
> - Some operators can make use of a feed. From DataMiner 10.3.5/10.4.0 onwards<!--  RN 35837 -->, a link icon is displayed to the right of a selection box if using a feed is possible. Click this icon to select the feed. In earlier DataMiner versions, a *Use feed* checkbox is available for this instead.
