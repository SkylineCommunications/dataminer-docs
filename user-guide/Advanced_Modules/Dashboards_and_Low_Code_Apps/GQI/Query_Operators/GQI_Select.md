# Select

The *Select* query operator displays the selected columns only. When you have selected the columns to display, you can apply another operator to refine the query.

From DataMiner 10.1.0\[CU1\]/10.1.3 onwards, up and down arrow buttons in the list of columns allow you to modify the order in which the columns are loaded. Click an arrow button to make a column switch places with the column below or above it in the list. Press Ctrl while clicking an arrow button to make the column switch places with the previous or next selected column instead.

From DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.5 onwards, you can add parameters from an existing feed in the dashboard to the selectable items. Prior to DataMiner 10.3.5/10.4.0<!--  RN 35837 -->, you can do so using the *Use feed* checkbox. In more recent DataMiner versions, you can instead click the link icon to the right of the relevant selection box.
