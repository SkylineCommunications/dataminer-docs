# Top X

The *Top X* query operator displays the top or bottom items of a specific column, with X being the number of items to display. When you select this option, you will need to specify the column from which items should be displayed and the number of items that should be displayed. By default, the top items are displayed. To display the bottom items instead, select the *Ascending* checkbox.

> [!NOTE]
> From DataMiner 10.1.0/10.1.3 onwards, exception values are not taken into account by this operator.
