# Get alarms

Available from DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.9 onwards. The *Get alarms* data source retrieves the alarms in the DataMiner System. Several columns, such as *Element Name*, *Parameter Description*, *Value* and *Time*, are included by default. Others can be added with a [*Select* operation](xref:GQI_Select).
