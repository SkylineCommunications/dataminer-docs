# Get ad hoc data

Available from DataMiner 10.3.0/10.2.4 onwards. The *Get ad hoc data* data source retrieves external data based on an Automation script that is compiled as a library. The data can for example be retrieved from a CSV file, a MySQL database, or an API endpoint. If no such Automation script has been configured, this option is not available.
