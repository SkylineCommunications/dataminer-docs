Available in soft launch from DataMiner 10.2.8/10.3.0 onwards<!--RN 33553-->. The *Get resources* data source retrieves all resources in the DataMiner System. For each resource, this includes among others the ID, name, and description of the resource, the name of the user who created and who last modified the resource, the time when the resource was created, and the time when the resource was last modified.

From DataMiner 10.3.11/10.4.0 onwards<!--RN 36970-->, the *Get resources* data source also allows you to filter resources by resource pool ID or booking ID.

> [!NOTE]
> The *Get resources* data source is only available on DataMiner Systems with a *ResourceManager* license and/or an *IDP* license.
