# Get object manager instances

The *Get object manager instances* data source retrieves [DOM instances](xref:DomInstance). To use this data source, you need to have at least one [DOM](xref:DOM) module defined in your DMS. When you configure the data source, you will first need to select the module the instance belongs to.<!-- RN 36124 -->
