# Importing a query

From DataMiner 10.1.4 onwards, you can import a query from a different dashboard in the DMS. To do so:

1. In the data pane, select *Queries* and click the import icon (to the right of the + icon).

1. In the dialog box, select the dashboard from which you want to import the query and the query itself, and specify a name for the query in your dashboard.

1. Click *Import*. The query will now be available for use in the data pane.
