# Using the Template Editor

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Template Editor is in preview until DataMiner 10.4.1/10.5.0. If you use the preview version of the feature, its functionality may be different from what is described below. For more information, see [Soft-launch options](xref:SoftLaunchOptions).

Available from DataMiner 10.4.1/10.5.0 onwards. Prior to this, the Template Editor is available in soft launch from DataMiner 10.2.12 onwards, if the soft-launch options *ReportsAndDashboardsDynamicVisuals* and *ReportsAndDashboardsScheduler* are enabled.

The Template Editor is currently supported for the following components:

- [Grid](xref:DashboardGrid)
- [Timeline](xref:DashboardTimeline)
- [Table](xref:DashboardTable)
- [Maps](xref:DashboardMaps) (Depending on your DataMiner version, you may require the [*ReportsAndDashboardsGQIMaps* soft-launch option](xref:Overview_of_Soft_Launch_Options#reportsanddashboardsgqimaps).)

## Accessing the Template Editor

- For the **grid** and **timeline** components:

  1. Select the component and go to the *Layout* tab on the right.

  1. In the *Item templates* section, click *Edit*.

     > [!NOTE]
     > A preview of the template currently used for this component is displayed in the *Item templates* section.

- For the **table** component:

  1. Select the component and go to the *Layout* tab on the right.

  1. In the *Column appearance* section, click the downward arrow next to *Select a column* and select the column you want to create a template for.

  1. Click the ellipsis button ("...") in the top-right corner and select *Customize preset*.

- For the **maps** component:

  1. Select the component and go to the *Layout* tab on the right.

  1. Under the *Layer settings* for a specific layer of the map, click *Edit* in the template section.

     These settings will only be available once a set of markers has been added to the component.

## Template Editor UI overview

![Template Editor](~/user-guide/images/Template_Editor.png)<br/>*The Template Editor in DataMiner 10.4.1*

The Template Editor UI consists of the following main components<!--RN 34858-->:

- Side pane:

  - The *Layers* tab (1A)

  - The *Tools* tab (1B)

- Preview (2)

- *Settings* pane (3)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any changes made in the Template Editor are only saved once you click the *Save* button in the lower right corner. When you close the Template Editor by clicking the "X" in the top-right corner or the *Cancel* button in the lower right corner, you will be alerted of any unsaved changes that may be lost if you close the editor prematurely.

## Working with layers

In the side pane of the Template Editor, the *Layers* tab offers an overview of all layers. Layers are used to make non-destructive edits by stacking icons, text, rectangles, and ellipses one on top of the other without compromising the pixels of individual elements.

The benefits of working with layers:

- You can add elements on top of each other without removing data.

- You can apply conditions to only one layer of the template. See [Adding conditional cases to a layer](#adding-conditional-cases-to-a-layer).

- You can discard any layers you no longer need without affecting the entire template.

- You can mask layers so that they are temporarily hidden without the need to delete them.

If one layer is positioned higher than another, the higher layer will appear in front of the lower one. To **change the order of layers**, click the ![*Drag-and-drop*](~/user-guide/images/drag-and-drop.png) button and drag the layer up or down in the *Layers* tab. Release the mouse button when you reach the position where you want to place the selected layer.

![Change order layers](~/user-guide/images/Change_Order_Layers.gif)<br/>*The Template Editor in DataMiner 10.4.1*

To **temporarily mask a layer** within the Template Editor, hover the mouse pointer over the layer and click the *eye* icon in the lower right corner. This action renders the layer invisible while you modify the template. To bring the layer back into view, click the *eye* icon again.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to render a layer invisible in the final result, you can mask the layer by adjusting its properties in the *Settings* pane. See [Specifying layer properties](#specifying-layer-properties).

To **delete a layer**, hover the mouse pointer over the layer and click the *delete* button in the top-right corner. Alternatively, select the layer in the preview and press *Delete* on your keyboard.

To **add a new layer**, [add a new tool](#adding-new-layers) in the *Tools* tab.

In the lower left corner of each layer, an icon denotes the layer type: an *icon*, *text*, *rectangle*, or *ellipse* layer.

## Adding new layers

In the *Tools* tab, you can add new layers to the template. Each tool in the *Tools* tab corresponds to a type of layer you can incorporate into your template. You can choose from the following types:

- Icon

- Text

- Rectangle

- Ellipse

![*Tools* tab](~/user-guide/images/Tools_Tab.png)<br/>*The Template Editor in DataMiner 10.4.1*

1. To add a new layer to the template, click the *Icon*, *Text*, *Rectangle*, or *Ellipse* button.

1. Within the preview, press and hold down the left mouse button to define the area for your new layer. The layer appears, enclosed by dotted lines in a frame around the selected area. Release the mouse button once you are satisfied with the size and shape of the tool.

1. Optionally, you can resize the layer by dragging the frame edges or move the layer by dragging and dropping it using the left mouse button.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Alternatively, you can also adjust the size, shape, and position of the layer in the [*Dimensions* section](#specifying-layer-dimensions) of the *Settings* pane.

1. Optionally, you can add certain properties and/or conditional cases to the layer. See [Specifying layer properties](#specifying-layer-properties) and [Adding conditional cases to a layer](#adding-conditional-cases-to-a-layer).

## Changing template settings

With the *Settings* pane to the right side of the preview, you can change the settings for the entire template and the different layers. The preview is then immediately updated according to the changes.

- To modify the **template settings**, make sure no layers are selected. In the *Settings* pane, you can specify the width and/or height of the template in pixels.

- To modify the **layer settings**, make sure a layer is selected. In the *Settings* pane, you can adjust the following layer settings in three collapsible sections:

  - [Dimensions](#specifying-layer-dimensions)

  - [Properties](#specifying-layer-properties)

  - [Conditional cases](#adding-conditional-cases-to-a-layer)

### Specifying layer dimensions

The table below describes the dimension settings available for template layers<!--RN 37476-->.

| Icon | Setting | Description |
|--|--|--|
| ![Width](~/user-guide/images/Dimensions_Width.png) | Width | Specify the width of the layer (in pixels or percent). This value should be lower than or equal to the width of the overall template. |
| ![Height](~/user-guide/images/Dimensions_Height.png) | Height | Specify the height of the layer (in pixels or percent). This value should be lower than or equal to the height of the overall template. |
| ![Top](~/user-guide/images/Dimensions_Top.png) | Top | Specify the location of the top of the layer (in pixels or percent). This value should be lower than the height of the overall template. |
| ![Bottom](~/user-guide/images/Dimensions_Bottom.png) | Bottom | Specify the location of the bottom of the layer (in pixels or percent). This value should be lower than the height of the overall template. |
| ![Left](~/user-guide/images/Dimensions_Left.png) | Left | Specify the location of the left edge of the layer (in pixels or percent). This value should be lower than the width of the overall template. |
| ![Right](~/user-guide/images/Dimensions_Right.png) | Right | Specify the location of the right edge of the layer (in pixels or percent). This value should be lower than the width of the overall template. |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - In the preview, when you use the drag-and-drop functionality to move a layer, or when you resize a layer by dragging the frame edges, the dimension settings in the *Settings* pane will automatically be adjusted.
> - You can change the unit to percent by clicking *px* next to the dimension values.
> - You can secure one or multiple dimension settings of a layer by clicking the ![*Lock*](~/user-guide/images/Dimensions_Lock.png) icon next to the chosen setting. This lock functionality enhances the security of your design, preserving your template's intended appearance, especially when dealing with variable widths and heights. For example, when adjusting a table column width, you may want to maintain specific proportions. Once a setting is locked, any attempt to override the specified dimension will be restricted. This includes moving or resizing the layer in the preview and adjusting the component size in the dashboard or low-code app edit mode (e.g. changing the size of a table column). The locked dimensions ensure that the template remains in its designated position. If you are unable to lock a dimension setting because of the locking of other settings, the lock icon will be grayed out.
> - For some layers, the width and height is determined by the left and right position and can therefore not be modified.

### Specifying layer properties

Depending on the type of layer, you can specify different layer properties in the *Settings* pane.

- For *Icon* layers, you can specify the following properties:

  - *Show icon*: Allows you to mask the layer, rendering it temporarily invisible. If disabled, the layer is still visible in the preview with lowered opacity, but it will not be visible in the template's end result.

  - *Color*: Allows you to specify a custom icon color, either by specifying the color in RGB format, by entering the hex value or HTML color name, or by using the color picker box.

### Adding conditional cases to a layer

For each layer, you can add one or multiple conditional cases in the *Conditional cases* section of the *Settings* pane, making certain actions dependent on one or more conditions.

A conditional case consists of two sections: A first section that contains one or more conditions combined with "and", and a second section that contains actions that exclusively execute when the conditions are met.

To add a condition:

1. Click *Add case*.

1. Choose a state or column from the dropdown list.

   The available states:

   - *Is selected*: The action will be executed when a user selects the item<!--RN 34761-->.

   - *Is busy*: The action will be executed when the component is busy<!--RN 34859-->.

   - *Hovering*: The action will be executed when a user hovers the mouse pointer over the item<!--RN 34761-->.

1. When you have chosen a state, select *Yes* or *No*.

   - *Yes*: The action is only executed when the element is in the specified state.

   - *No*: The action is only executed when the element is not in the specified state.

1. When you have chosen a column, provide the necessary details based on the column type.

   Some examples:

   - Element name: The action is only executed when the element name matches this entry.

   - Parameter description: The action is only executed when the parameter description matches this entry.

   - Root time: The action is only executed when the current time aligns with the specified timestamp.

     - `= dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm`: The root time matches the specified timestamp.

     - `> dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm`: The root time occurs after the specified lower bound.

     - `≥ dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm`: The root time occurs at or after the specified lower bound.

     - `< dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm`: The root time occurs before the specified upper bound.

     - `≤ dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm`: The root time occurs at or before the specified upper bound.

1. Enable or disable the toggle button next to `Show [layer-type]`:

   - If this is enabled, the selected layer is shown if the conditions are met.

   - If this is disabled, the selected layer is hidden if the conditions are met.

1. If you chose to show the layer in the previous step, optionally change the look of the layer when the conditions are met.

   Depending on the type of layer and the type of component, the following options may be available:

   - *Icon* layer:

     - *Color*: Allows you to select a color for the tool, either by specifying the color in RGB format, by entering the hex value or HTML color name, or by using the color picker box.

     - *Icon*: Allows you to select a new icon from the dropdown list. You can search for a specific icon using the filter box at the top.

   - *Text* layer:

     - *Text*: Allows you to enter custom text. HTML text formatting is supported.

       > For more information on formatting elements designed to display special types of text, see [HTML Text Formatting](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp).

     - *Font size*: Allows you to set the font size.

     - *Text color*: Allows you to select a text color, either by specifying the color in RGB format, by entering the hex value or HTML color name, or by using the color picker box.

     - *Border radius*: Allows you to specify the roundness (in pixels) of the background color that can be displayed behind the text (optionally).

     - *Background*: Allows you to specify a custom background color, either by specifying the color in RGB format, by entering the hex value or HTML color name, or by using the color picker box.

     - *Horizontal padding*: Allows you to specify the amount of space (in pixels) that should be left free above the text.

     - *Vertical padding*: Allows you to specify the amount of space (in pixels) that should be left free underneath the text.

     - *Text alignment*: Determines the horizontal alignment (left, center, right, or justify).

     - *Vertical alignment*: Determines the vertical alignment (top, center, or bottom).

   - *Rectangle* layer:

     - *Color*: Allows you to select a color for the tool, either by specifying the color in RGB format, by entering the hex value or HTML color name, or by using the color picker box.

     - *Border radius*: Allows you to specify the roundness (in pixels) of the background color that can be displayed behind the text (optionally).

     - *Link width to*: Allows you to link the width of this tool to that of another column, selected from the dropdown list.

     - *Link height to*: Allows you to link the height of this tool to that of another column, selected from the dropdown list.

   - *Ellipse* layer:

     - *Color*: Allows you to select a color for the tool, either by specifying the color in RGB format, by entering the hex value or HTML color name, or by using the color picker box.

   > [!TIP]
   > For a full overview of all HTML color names, see [HTML Color Names](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colornames.asp).

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - Any visual changes made when configuring a conditional case will not show up in the preview.
   > - From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.3 onwards<!--RN 38368-->, you can reset visual changes made when configuring a conditional case by clicking the ![reset](~/user-guide/images/Reset_Button.png) button to the right of the option you want to reset. Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.3, you can only reset custom text entered for a *Text* layer.

1. Optionally, in a low-code app, you can configure actions that are executed when a user clicks the tool. Only available for *Icon*, *Rectangle*, and *Ellipse* layers<!--RN 34761-->.

   > [!TIP]
   > For more information on how to configure these actions, see [Configuring low-code app events](xref:LowCodeApps_event_config).

1. If you want to add another condition, go back to step 1 and repeat the steps until all the necessary conditions have been added.

#### Example

This is a possible conditional case configuration:
