# Feeds

Many components in dashboards and low-code apps can be configured to be linked to a feed, so that their content can be dynamically adjusted by the users.

To have components updated based on a feed, you can add feed components to the dashboard or low-code app. Data input for such a component can then be selected by the user. Alternatively, you can also specify data input for a feed in a dashboard URL.
