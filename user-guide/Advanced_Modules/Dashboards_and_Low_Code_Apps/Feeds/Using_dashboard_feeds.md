# Feeds

Many components in dashboards and low-code apps can be configured to be linked to a feed, so that their content can be dynamically adjusted by the users.

To have components updated based on a feed, you can add feed components to the dashboard or low-code app. Data input for such a component can then be selected by the user. Alternatively, you can also [specify data input for a feed in a dashboard URL](xref:Specifying_data_input_in_a_dashboard_URL).

You can [configure feed components](xref:Configuring_feed_components) by adding the desired feed components and using them as data feeds. In instances where you want to link a component to data in the URL without using any feed components, you can configure a dashboard or low-code app to [use a URL feed without a feed component](xref:Configuring_a_dashboard_to_use_a_URL_feed_without_a_feed_component). Additionally, you can [incorporate dynamic references to feed values within text](xref:Feed_Link).
