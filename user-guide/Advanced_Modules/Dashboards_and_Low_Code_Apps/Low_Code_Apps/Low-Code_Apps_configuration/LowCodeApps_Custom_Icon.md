# Customizing the icon and color of an app

To customize the color and icon for a low-code app, select the icon in the top-left corner.

You can then:

- Select any of the displayed icons to use that icon instead.

- Click the upload button to upload a custom icon of your own.

- Use the color picker to specify a different color for the app.

To close the color and icon editor, click the icon in the top-left corner again.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also change the theme for a specific page within your app in the same way as in the Dashboards app. These themes are in fact shared with the Dashboards app. Note also that it is currently not yet possible to modify an existing theme directly in the Low-Code Apps, but you can do so via the Dashboards app. For more information, see [Configuring the dashboard layout](xref:Configuring_the_dashboard_layout).
