# Configuring the low-code app layout

## Customizing the icon and color of an app

To customize the color and icon for a low-code app, select the icon in the top-left corner.

You can then:

- Select any of the displayed icons to use that icon instead.

- Click the upload button to upload a custom icon of your own.

## Customizing the theme for a low-code app page

The theme of a low-code app page determines which colors are used on the page.

To apply an existing theme, see [Applying an existing theme to a low-code app page](#applying-an-existing-theme-to-a-low-code-app-page).

To create a new theme, see [Creating a new theme for a low-code app page](#creating-a-new-theme-for-a-low-code-app-page).

### Applying an existing theme to a low-code app page

1. Make sure the low-code app page is in edit mode and no components are selected. See [Editing a low-code application](xref:Editing_custom_apps).

1. In the panel on the right, select the *Layout* tab.

1. Click the box indicating the currently used theme.

   A list of available themes will be displayed below the box.

1. Select the theme you wish to use.

> [!NOTE]
> From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU13]/10.4.0 [CU1]/10.4.4 onwards<!--RN 38472-->, the selected theme is also applied to any interactive Automation script windows launched when clicking:
>
> - a [button component](xref:DashboardButton)
> - an entry in a [grid](xref:DashboardGrid) or [timeline component](xref:DashboardTimeline)
> - a marker in a [maps component](xref:DashboardMaps)
> - a cell or double-clicking a row in a [table component](xref:DashboardTable)
> - a node in a [service definition component](xref:DashboardServiceDefinition)
> - a region on a [Visual Overview component](xref:DashboardVisualOverview)
> - a [button](xref:LowCodeApps_header_config) in the header bar of a low-code app page or panel
> - a [DOM action](xref:DOM_actions#interactive-script) button
> - a page of a low-code app is loaded
>
> [Custom themes](#creating-a-new-theme-for-a-low-code-app-page) do not carry over to interactive Automation script windows, resulting in a default white background color and black text color. Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU13]/10.4.0 [CU1]/10.4.4, the theme does not get applied to interactive Automation script windows, resulting in a default white background color and black text color.
