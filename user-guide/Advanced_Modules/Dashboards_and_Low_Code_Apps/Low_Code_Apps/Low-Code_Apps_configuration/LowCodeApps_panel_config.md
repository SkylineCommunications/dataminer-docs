# Configuring a panel of a low-code app

In addition to pages, panels can be configured in apps in the Low-Code Apps module. These contain secondary content that can be shown on top of pages. Panels can be shown or hidden via actions, for example when a user clicks a button. They can also be reused on multiple different pages.

1. While you are editing a page, in the page configuration pane, open the *panels* section.

1. To add a new panel, click the "+" button in this section, and then specify a name for your panel.

1. To configure a panel, click the pencil icon next to the panel. This will open the panel configuration pane.

1. To configure a header bar for the panel, follow the same steps as to configure this for a page. See [Configuring the header bar of a low-code app page](xref:LowCodeApps_header_config).

1. Click the pencil icon to configure the components on the panel. Configuring these components is done in the same way as configuring components in the Dashboards app. See [Configuring dashboard components](xref:Configuring_dashboard_components) and [Changing dashboard settings](xref:Changing_dashboard_settings). For a list of the available components, refer to [Available visualizations](xref:Available_visualizations).
