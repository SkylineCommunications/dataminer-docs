# Editing a low-code application

> [!NOTE]
> To view, add, edit, delete, or publish low-code applications, you need to have the necessary user permissions under [Modules > User-definable apps](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#modules--user-definable-apps) as well as the [DataMiner web apps](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#general--dataminer-web-apps--dataminer-cube-mobile-access) user permission.

To edit an existing low-code application:

1. Open the application from the DataMiner landing page (see [Accessing the Low-Code Apps module](xref:Accessing_custom_apps)).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Draft apps are not shown by default on the landing page. To view them, click the cogwheel button and activate *Show draft applications*.

1. Click the user icon in the top-right corner and select *Edit*.

1. [Customize the app](xref:LowCodeApps_Custom_Icon), or edit the [pages](xref:LowCodeApps_page_config), [panels](xref:LowCodeApps_panel_config), [header bar](xref:LowCodeApps_header_config), [events](xref:LowCodeApps_event_config), or [security](xref:LowCodeApps_security_config) as needed.

1. When the app is ready, click the ![Publish](~/user-guide/images/AppPublishIcon.png) icon in the header bar to save your changes and publish it.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Once an app has been published, it is not possible to revert it to a draft.
