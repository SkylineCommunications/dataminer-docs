# Deleting a low-code application

> [!NOTE]
> To view, add, edit, delete, or publish low-code applications, you need to have the necessary user permissions under [Modules > User-definable apps](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#modules--user-definable-apps) as well as the [DataMiner web apps](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#general--dataminer-web-apps--dataminer-cube-mobile-access) user permission.

To delete an existing low-code application:

1. Open the application from the DataMiner landing page (see [Accessing the Low-Code Apps module](xref:Accessing_custom_apps)).

1. Click the user icon in the top-right corner and select *Edit*.

1. Click the garbage can icon next to the user icon.

1. In the pop-up window, select to delete the entire application, and click *Delete*.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also select to delete the current draft version of the app instead. This draft version gets created as soon as you click *Edit*, so selecting this option will never remove a previously saved version.
