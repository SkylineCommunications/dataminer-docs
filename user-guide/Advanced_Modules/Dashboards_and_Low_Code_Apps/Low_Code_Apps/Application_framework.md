# DataMiner Low-Code Apps

With the DataMiner Low-Code Apps module, you can create custom applications that interact with data from a DataMiner System or from an external source.

The DataMiner Low-Code Apps module is fully available from DataMiner 10.2.5/10.3.0 onwards. Prior to this, starting from DataMiner 10.0.8, you can preview it if the *Applications* [soft-launch option](xref:SoftLaunchOptions) is enabled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Low-Code Apps module requires the "Low-Code Apps" license. For more information on acquiring this license, contact the Skyline Sales department.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Along with the other DataMiner web apps, you can upgrade DataMiner Low-Code Apps separately from your main DataMiner installation. This means that you can for example have a DataMiner System using version 10.3.4, while you already use version 10.3.5 for the web apps. You can [download the web apps upgrade package from DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/downloads/).
> - To view, add, edit, delete, or publish low-code applications, you need to have the necessary user permissions under [Modules > User-definable apps](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#modules--user-definable-apps) as well as the [DataMiner web apps](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#general--dataminer-web-apps--dataminer-cube-mobile-access) user permission.
