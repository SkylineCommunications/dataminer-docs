## Step 1: Create an app

The DataMiner Low-Code Apps are available on the DataMiner landing page. To access this page, browse to the IP or hostname of a DMA or to *https://[Your DMA]/root*, depending on your configuration.

1. Hover over a section below the DataMiner apps section until you see the "+" icon, and then click that icon to start creating a new app.

   A preliminary version of a new application, also known as a draft, will be generated. Drafts serve as temporary iterations that aid in the development of an app. Once the necessary adjustments and modifications have been made, you can release a draft for public use.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If no other apps have been created yet, you can click the *Create a new app* option instead.

Your app is currently in the "Draft" stage, but you can now take it live by publishing it. This will make it visible to everyone with the rights to access DataMiner Low-Code Apps.

1. Click the leftmost icon in the top-right corner.
