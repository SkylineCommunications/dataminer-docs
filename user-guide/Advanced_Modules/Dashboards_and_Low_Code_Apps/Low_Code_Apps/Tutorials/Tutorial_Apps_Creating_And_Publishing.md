## Step 1: Create an app

The DataMiner Low-Code Apps are available on the DataMiner landing page. To access this page, browse to the IP or hostname of a DMA or to *https://[Your DMA]/root*, depending on your configuration.

1. Hover over a section below the DataMiner apps section until you see the "+" icon, and then click that icon to start creating a new app.

   A preliminary version of a new application, also known as a draft, will be generated. Drafts serve as temporary iterations that aid in the development of an app. Once the necessary adjustments and modifications have been made, you can release a draft for public use.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If no other apps have been created yet, you can click the *Create a new app* option instead.
