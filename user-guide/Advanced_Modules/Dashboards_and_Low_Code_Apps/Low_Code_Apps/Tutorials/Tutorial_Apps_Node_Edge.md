# Getting started with node edge graphs

This tutorial shows how you can get started with the node edge graph component based on a basic example. In this example, a node edge graph component will be used to build a basic network diagram using GQI queries. This tutorial uses a dashboard, but you can also create node edge graphs in a low-code app.

The content and screenshots of this tutorial were created in DataMiner version 10.4.3.

Expected duration: 20 minutes

## Step 1: Deploy the tutorial package from the catalog

To deploy the package:

1. Go to the [Kata Node Edge](https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/package/5838) package in the DataMiner Catalog.

1. Click the *Deploy* button to deploy the package on your DMA.

   While the package is being deployed, you can follow the progress of the deployment in the [Admin app](xref:Accessing_the_Admin_app), on the *Deployments* page for your DMS. Make sure to use the *Refresh* button in the top-left corner.

The package contains the following components:

- Automation script [JSON Reader](https://catalog.dataminer.services/details/automation-script/5491): You will be able to find this in the Automation module, in the folder *Automation Scripts/GQI/Data sources*.

- Provisioning files: These will be available in the Documents module, in the folder *GQI data sources*.

  - *list_pc.json*: List of PCs.

  - *list_network_devices.json*: List of network devices (switch, router).

  - *list_connection_single.json*: List of connections between devices (single connection).

  - *list_connection_bidirectional.json*: List of connection between devices (double connection).

    This file contains two connections per physical connection, i.e. one connection from source to destination and another connection from destination to source.

  - *list_interface.json*: List of interfaces exposed by each device.

  - *list_router.json*: List of routers (included in list_network_devices).

  - *list_switch.json*: List of switches (included in list_network_devices).

- Dashboards: These will be located in the folder *KATA*.

  - *Node_Edge*: A blank dashboard containing all GQI queries required to create the node-edge diagram for this tutorial.

  - *Node_Edge_Extra*: A dashboard similar to the previous dashboard, with additional GQI queries for more complex diagrams. This will not be used for this tutorial.

The dashboard *Node_Edge* contains the following GQI queries:

- *Node_Network_Devices*: The nodes representing the switches and routers available in the network diagram.

- *Node_PC*: The nodes representing the PCs available in the network diagram.

- *Edges*: The connections displayed in the network diagram.

- *Interface*: The interfaces exposed by the devices in the network diagram (not used in this tutorial).

- *Edge_With_Interface*: The connections displayed in the network diagram, with extra information per connection. As the name suggest, this GQI query is built from the GQI queries *Edges* and *Interfaces*. This GQI query will not be used in this tutorial.

## Step 2: Add the node edge graph component

1. When the package has been deployed, go to the [Dashboards app](xref:Accessing_the_Dashboards_app).

1. In the pane on the left, navigate to *KATA* > *NODE_EDGE* to open the *Node_Edge* dashboard.

1. Click the pencil icon in the dashboard header bar to start editing the dashboard.

1. Drag a *Node edge graph* visualization from the pane on the left onto the dashboard.

   ![Node edge graph visualization](~/user-guide/images/Node_edge_tutorial1.png)

1. In the *Data pane* on the right, expand the *Queries* node, and drag the following queries to the visualization you have just added:

   - *Node_Network_Devices*

   - *Edges*

   ![Add queries to the visualization](~/user-guide/images/Node_edge_tutorial2.png)

## Step 3: Configure the router and switch nodes

1. Click the node edge graph component you have added to select it.

1. Select the *Settings* pane on the right.

   The queries you added earlier will be listed under *Unassigned queries*.

1. Under the query *Node_Network_Devices*, select *Set as node*.

   ![Set a query as node](~/user-guide/images/Node_edge_tutorial3.png)

   The selected query will be moved to the bottom of the pane.

1. For the same query, set *Node ID column* to the column *Device ID*.

   This way, you indicate that the *Device ID* column contains the IDs representing the different entities that should be shown as nodes.

   Three nodes will now be displayed in the node edge graph component, representing a router and two switches. By default, the icon displayed for each node is a circle.

   ![Specify the node ID column](~/user-guide/images/Node_edge_tutorial4.png)

1. Add an override for the **router** node:

   1. Click *Add override*.

      ![Add override](~/user-guide/images/Node_edge_tutorial5.png)

   1. In the *Filter* box, select *Type*.

      A text box will now be displayed to the right of the filter.

   1. In the text box, specify `Router`.

      ![Set filter type to Router](~/user-guide/images/Node_edge_tutorial6.png)

   1. In the *Weight* box, specify `2`.

      This will ensure that the node representing the router is positioned at the top of the component. This is because with the default layout settings, the higher the weight of a node, the higher the position of the node in the graph.

   1. In the *Shape* box, select *Hexagon*.

      The node representing the router will now have a hexagon shape. Optionally, you can also change the color of the shape by clicking the colored circle to the right of the *Shape* box.

   1. In the *Icon* box, change select *NetworkDeviceScanning*.

      > [!NOTE]
      > To quickly find a specific icon in the list, start typing the name of the icon in the box.

   1. In the *Label* box, select *Device Name*.

      The name of the device will now be displayed below the node representing the router.

      ![Router node override](~/user-guide/images/Node_edge_tutorial7.png)

1. Add an override for the **switch** nodes:

   1. Click *Add Override* again.

   1. In the *Filter* box, select *Type*, and enter the value `Switch` in the box on the right.

   1. Keep the *Weight* set to 1.

      This will ensure that the nodes representing the switches are positioned below the router node.

   1. In the *Shape* box, select *Decagon*.

      The node representing the switch will now have a decagon shape. Optionally, you can also change the color of the shape by clicking the colored circle to the right of the *Shape* box.

   1. In the *Icon* box, select *Switch*.

   1. In the *Label* box, select *Device Name*.

      The nodes should now look like this:

      ![Switch nodes override](~/user-guide/images/Node_edge_tutorial8.png)

## Step 4: Configure the edges between router and switch nodes

1. At the top of the *Unassigned queries* list, under the query *Edges*, select *Set as edge*.

   The query will be moved to the bottom of the pane.

1. In the *Source* box, select *Source Device ID*.

1. In the *Destination* box, select *Destination Device ID*.

   The edges connecting the router and switches will now be displayed in the node-edge graph visualization.

   ![Edges between router and switch nodes](~/user-guide/images/Node_edge_tutorial9.png)

1. In the *Style* box, select *Dotted*.

1. Enable the toggle button *Visualize Directions*.

   An animation showing the direction of the connection between the switches and the router will now be displayed. The direction will be from switch to router.

   ![Edges visualizing the directions](~/user-guide/images/Node_edge_tutorial10.gif)

## Step 5: Add nodes representing PCs

In this step, you will add extra nodes representing PCs to the component. The same *Edges* query will be used for this, as this query contains the connections between all devices.

1. From the *Data pane* on the right, drag the *Node_PC* query to the node edge graph component.

1. Click the node edge graph component to select it, and select the *Settings* pane on the right.

1. Under *Unassigned queries*, set the *Node_PC* query as node.

   ![Set the query as node](~/user-guide/images/Node_edge_tutorial11.png)

   The selected query will be moved below the node query you configured earlier.

1. For the same query, set *Node ID column* to the column *Device ID*.

   Six nodes will be displayed in the node edge graph component. By default, the icon displayed for each node is a circle.

1. Expand the *Node_PC* base node by clicking the triangle icon next to it.

   This will display the list of settings for this node. Instead of overriding this node, you will now update the settings for the base node. This means that all the nodes for this GQI query will be updated in the same way.

1. In the *Shape* box, select *Circle*.

   The node representing the PCs will now have this shape. Optionally, you can also change the color of the shape by clicking the colored circle to the right of the *Shape* box.

1. In the *Icon* box, select *ThisPC*.

1. In the *Label* box, select *Device Name*.

The resulting nodes will look like this:

![PC nodes](~/user-guide/images/Node_edge_tutorial12.png)

## Step 6: Configure the edges connecting the PCs and switches

Since the GQI query *Edges* contains all the connections between devices in the network diagram, you will need to override the configuration for this query, first for the edges between router and switches, and then for the edges between PCs and switches.

1. Override the edges between router and switches:

   1. Extend the GQI Query *Edges* configured Step 2.

      The fields *Source* and *Destination* will be displayed. Next to these fields, you will see different icons. These represent the nodes configured in the previous steps.

   1. For the *Source* field, click the icon that is highlighted by default.

      This way, the icon will no longer be selected.

   1. Click the icon representing the switches instead.

      ![Switch icon as source](~/user-guide/images/Node_edge_tutorial13.png)

   1. For the *Destination* field, also click the currently highlighted icon to deselect it, and then click the icon representing the router.

      ![Router icon as destination](~/user-guide/images/Node_edge_tutorial14.png)

      The connections between switches and routers will now be displayed.

1. Override the edges between PCs and switches:

   1. At the bottom of the settings pane, click *Add Override*.

      The following setting will be displayed:

      ![Edges override](~/user-guide/images/Node_edge_tutorial15.png)

   1. Under *Between (empty)*, select the icon representing the PCs

   1. Under *And (empty)*, select the icon representing the switches

   1. In the *Style* box, select *Dotted*

   1. Enable the toggle button *Visualize Directions*.

   An animation showing the direction of the connection between the PCs and the switches will now be displayed. The direction will be from PC to switch. With this, your node edge graph is now complete.
