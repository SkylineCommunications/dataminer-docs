# Editing an existing app

This tutorial shows how to edit an existing app.

## Overview

- [Step 1: Edit the latest version of your app](#step-1-edit-the-latest-version-of-your-app)
- [Step 2: Edit a previous version of your app](#step-2-edit-a-previous-version-of-your-app)

## Step 1: Edit the latest version of your app

The DataMiner Low-Code Apps are available on the DataMiner landing page. To access this page, browse to the IP or hostname of a DMA or to *https://[Your DMA]/root*, depending on your configuration.

1. Click the app on the landing page to open it.

1. To start editing the app, click your user image or initials and select *Edit*.

   ![Edit option](~/tutorials/images/EditApp.png)

   This will open the application editor again, which was used before when creating the application. A new draft version of your app is made, to which you can make the necessary changes.

1. When you have made all the changes you want, [publish the application](xref:Tutorial_Apps_Creating_And_Publishing#step-2-publish-the-app) again to make the latest version available to everyone with the rights to access DataMiner Low-Code Apps.

## Step 2: Edit a previous version of your app

Occasionally, there may be a need to edit a previous version of an application. This could for example be to review the previous configuration of the app or to roll back to the previously published version.

1. Click the app on the landing page to open it.

1. Click your user image or initials and select *Versions*.

   ![Versions option](~/tutorials/images/VersionsUser.png)

   This brings up a list of previous versions.

1. Open the version you want to edit by hovering over it in the list and then clicking the pencil icon.

   ![Version history](~/tutorials/images/EditHistory.png)

   This will open up the application editor. A new draft version of your app is made based on the version you selected, to which you can make changes in the same way as when you edit the latest version.
