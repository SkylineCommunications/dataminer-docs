# Accessing the Low-Code Apps module

The DataMiner Low-Code Apps are available on the DataMiner landing page. To access this page, browse to the IP or hostname of a DMA or to `https://[Your DMA]/root`, depending on your configuration.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Depending on your configuration, the Monitoring app may be displayed instead when you browse directly to a DMA IP or hostname. See [Configuring whether the landing page is displayed](xref:Configuring_the_landing_page#configuring-whether-the-landing-page-is-displayed).
> - To view the Low-Code Apps module, you need the user permission [Modules > User-definable apps > View apps](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#modules--user-definable-apps--view-apps).
> - Draft apps are not shown by default. To view them, click the cogwheel button and activate *Show draft applications*.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your DataMiner account is linked to your dataminer.services account, you will be logged in automatically with that linked DataMiner account.
