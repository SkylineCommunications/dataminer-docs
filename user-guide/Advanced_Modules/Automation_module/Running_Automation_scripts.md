# Running Automation scripts

Once a script has been designed, it can be executed in several ways:

- Manually: a one-time execution from a Visual Overview or from the *Automation* module. See [Manually executing a script](xref:Manually_executing_a_script) and [Script execution options](xref:Script_execution_options).

- With DataMiner Scheduler: scripts can be run automatically at certain predefined points in time. See [Scheduler](xref:scheduler).

- With DataMiner Correlation: scripts can be run automatically whenever user-defined events occur. See [Running an Automation script from a Correlation rule](xref:Running_an_Automation_script_from_a_Correlation_rule).
