# ExecuteScriptOnDomInstanceActionSettings

This settings object contains the names of the scripts that should be executed whenever a [DomInstance](xref:DomInstance) is created, updated, or deleted. If no name is filled in, no script will be executed.

The scripts used must have a `OnDomInstanceCrud` entry point defined. This makes it possible to know for what action and `DomInstance` the script was triggered.

```csharp
[AutomationEntryPoint(AutomationEntryPointType.Types.OnDomInstanceCrud)]
public void OnDomInstanceCrud(Engine engine, Guid id, CrudType crudType)
{
  engine.GenerateInformation($"Script triggered for {crudType} action on DomInstance with ID: {id}");
}
```
