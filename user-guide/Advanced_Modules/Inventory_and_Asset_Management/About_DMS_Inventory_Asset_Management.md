# About DataMiner Inventory & Asset Management

DataMiner Inventory and Asset Management is a DataMiner add-on module that establishes a bidirectional link between your DataMiner System and your Configuration Management Database (CMDB).

It enables you to:

- Manage your CMDB from within DataMiner Cube,

- Combine real-time data from the DataMiner System with asset data from the CMDB (in the DataMiner Alarm Console, in DataMiner reports, etc.),

- Push real-time data collected by DataMiner to the CMDB (e.g. DataMiner fetches the serial number of a device and subsequently stores this number in the CMDB),

- ...

To access DataMiner Inventory & Asset Management:

- In DataMiner Cube, go to *Apps* > *Asset Manager*.

> [!NOTE]
> The DataMiner Inventory and Asset Management module requires a special license.
