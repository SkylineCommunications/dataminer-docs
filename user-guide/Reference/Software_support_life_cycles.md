# Software support life cycles

## DataMiner support life cycle policy

If you are following the **Feature Release** track, you always need to **upgrade to the latest version** to get the latest security updates. If you do not want to upgrade to a new Feature Release version but do want to get the latest security updates, you will need to switch to the Main Release track instead.

For the **Main Release** track, the following support is available:

| Version | Regular updates until | Supported until     | *Limited support until* |
|---------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 10.5.0  | 20 Nov 2026           | **25 Feb 2028**     | *23 Feb 2029*           |
| 10.4.0  | 21 Nov 2025           | **26 Feb 2027**     | *25 Feb 2028*           |
| 10.3.0  | 15 Nov 2024           | **27 Feb 2026**     | *26 Feb 2027*           |
| 10.2.0  | 24 Nov 2023           | **28 Feb 2025**     | *27 Feb 2026*           |
| 10.1.0  | 18 Nov 2022           | **23 Feb 2024**     | *28 Feb 2025*           |

Older versions are no longer supported.

Legend:

- **Regular updates**: Monthly cumulative updates containing fixes and security updates.
- **Supported**: Security updates and critical bug fixes only (as required).
- **Limited support**: Online technical help without software updates for fixes, security updates, or features.

> [!NOTE]
> For security updates with third-party dependencies that are only compatible with a later version of DataMiner, it will be necessary to upgrade to this later version.
