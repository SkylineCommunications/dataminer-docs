# Taskbar Utility shortcut menu

When you right-click the DataMiner Taskbar Utility system tray icon, a menu appears with the following commands:

- **Launch \> DataMiner Cube**

    Starts DataMiner Cube as a web application.

- **Launch \> Tools \> Client Test**

    Starts the SLNetClientTest program.

    > [!WARNING]
    > The DataMiner SLNetClientTest program is an advanced system administration tool that should be used with extreme care (C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Files\\SLNetClientTest.exe).

    > [!TIP]
    > See also:
    > [SLNetClientTest tool](xref:SLNetClientTest_tool)

- **Launch \> Tools \> Clean Client Files**

    Starts SLCleanCabFiles.exe, which is located in C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Tools\\.

- **Launch \> Tools \> Log Collector**

    Starts the SLLogCollector tool. (Available in the shortcut menu from DataMiner 9.6.0 CU23/10.0.0 CU13/10.1.0 CU2/10.1.5 onwards.)

    > [!TIP]
    > See also: [SLLogCollector](xref:SLLogCollector)

- **Upgrade**

    Allows you to upgrade the DataMiner Agents in your DataMiner System.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - If an upgrade is started using the DataMiner Taskbar Utility, from DataMiner 9.6.5 onwards, a button is available that allows you to abort the upgrade in progress. However, be very careful with this functionality, as aborting an upgrade can potentially cause a DMA to no longer start up.
    > - From DataMiner 10.1.0 [CU19]/10.2.0 [CU7]/10.2.10 onwards, this option also allows you to install .dmapp packages. In earlier DataMiner versions, only .dmupgrade packages are supported.

- **Stop DataMiner (forced)**

    Restarts the DataMiner Agent software on the server you are connected to.

- **Options**

    Allows you to specify a number of program options:

    - The DataMiner user credentials used to connect to the SLNet process. If empty, the credentials of the current Windows user will be used.

    - The folder on the DataMiner Agent in which the backup packages are stored.

    - The setting that controls whether or not the DataMiner Taskbar Utility program will start up automatically each time the server is restarted.

    In the *About* tab, the options window also displays the version number of the Taskbar Utility application.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are using a DataMiner version prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU3]/10.3.6, to avoid issues in a DMS that is configured to only use HTTPS/SSL communication, go to *Options* > *slnet* and select the checkbox *HTTPS Support*.

- **Exit**

    Closes the DataMiner Taskbar Utility program.
