# Trap sender

You can access the trap sender functionality of the tool by selecting *Tools* > *Trap Sender* in the menu bar.

This will open a window consisting of the following sections:

- At the top, a menu bar is displayed, containing only the *File* menu. See [File menu](xref:File_menu).

- The top left corner displays the *General configuration*. See [General configuration](xref:General_config).

- The top right corner contains the configuration of how much time should be between each sent trap. See [Packet interval schedule](xref:Packet_interval_schedule).

- On the left, an overview of all available traps is displayed. See [Loaded packets](xref:Loaded_packets).

- In the middle, you can find more details about the trap that is selected in the overview on the left. See [Packet configuration and bindings](xref:Packet_configuration_and_bindings).
