# Communicating with other DataMiner users via Alerter

The *Collaboration* tab allows you to exchange chat messages with other users of the DataMiner System to which you are connected.

If you send a message to other Alerter users, they will see a balloon mentioning that they have received a new collaboration message. If they click the text area of this balloon, the Alerter application window will open and show the Collaboration tab.

By default, the collaboration balloon will show up in the lower right corner of a userâ€™s screen, in addition to any alarm balloons. However, it can be dragged to a new position, which is then saved as the new default position.
