# Configuring options related to acknowledging alarms

From DataMiner 10.0.10 onwards, it is possible to fine-tune what happens when an alarm is acknowledged via an Alerter pop-up balloon.

To do so:

1. Go to *Settings* > *Acknowledge*.

1. Select the checkboxes for the following options according to your preference:

    - *Hide the comment window when acknowledging an alarm*: By default, when you take ownership of an alarm via an Alerter pop-up balloon, you also need to specify a comment. If this option is selected, the comment window is not shown.

    - *Set the alarm as read in Cube after the alarm has been acknowledged*: If both Alerter and DataMiner Cube are used on the same client machine and the same user is connected to both applications, you can select this option to have an alarm marked as read as soon as you acknowledge it via an Alerter pop-up balloon.
