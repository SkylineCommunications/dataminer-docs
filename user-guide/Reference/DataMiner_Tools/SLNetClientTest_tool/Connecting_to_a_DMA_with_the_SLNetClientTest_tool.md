# Connecting to a DMA with the SLNetClientTest tool

Before you can use any of the SLNetClientTest tool functions, you must first connect to a DMA:

## [From DataMiner 10.3.1/10.4.0 onwards](#tab/tabid-1)

1. In the *Connection* menu, click *Connect*.

1. In the *Connect* window, select the host DMA.

1. Indicate how the connection has to be established, in the *Connection Type* section:

   | Option                 | Description    |
   |------------------------|----------------|
   | Autodetect             | Connects to the local machine or a remote machine using a method that will be detected automatically. |
   | gRPC                   | Supported from DataMiner 10.3.0/10.3.2 onwards. Connects to the local machine or a remote machine via the APIGateway service using the GRPCWeb protocol. When you choose this option, you can specify a custom port (default: `443`) and a custom endpoint (default: `/APIGateway`). |
   | .NET Remoting (legacy) | Connects to the local machine or a remote machine using .NET Remoting. When you choose this option, you can specify a custom port (default: `8004`). |
   | IPC (only local)       | Connects to the local machine using IPC. |

1. In the *Authentication* section, specify the necessary options, and then click *Connect*:

   - Single sign-on

     > [!NOTE]
     >
     > - You will be logged on with your current Windows user account.
     > - External authentication is not yet supported.

   - Explicit credentials (with *Force Authenticate Local User* option)

   - Ticket

   - Debug SAML (Available from DataMiner 10.3.11/10.4.0 onwards<!--RN 37370-->)

     > [!NOTE]
     > When you select this option before connecting to a DMA that uses external authentication via SAML, two pop-up windows will appear, displaying the SAML requests and SAML responses respectively.

## [Prior to DataMiner 10.3.1/10.4.0](#tab/tabid-2)

1. In the *Connection* menu, click *Connect*.

1. In the *Connect* window, select the host DMA.

1. Specify any of the following options if necessary, and then click *Connect*:

    - To use a different logon, select *Disable Windows Logon* and enter your credentials.

    - To connect via Web Services, select *Web Services* instead of the default *Remoting*.

    - To specify a different port for the connection, select *Disable Auto-Discover* and *Specify Port*, and enter the port.

    - To disable any client-side caching, select *Disable Client Cache*.
