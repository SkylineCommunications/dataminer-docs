# Managing trend patterns

From DataMiner 10.1.0/10.1.2 onwards, it is possible to view and delete trend patterns that can be detected by DataMiner Analytics using the SLNetClientTest tool.

> [!NOTE]
> From DataMiner 10.3.6/10.4.0 onwards, you can also manage trend patterns directly in DataMiner Cube. See [Managing pattern definitions](xref:Managing_pattern_definitions).

To do so:

1. [Connect to the DMA using the SLNetClientTest tool](xref:Connecting_to_a_DMA_with_the_SLNetClientTest_tool).

1. Go to *Advanced* > *Analytics* > *Pattern Matching*. This will open a window where all patterns are listed.

1. To view detailed information on a pattern, make sure the *See preview* checkbox is selected, and select the pattern in the list.

   To remove a pattern, select it in the list and click the *Delete* button.

> [!TIP]
> See also: [Working with pattern matching](xref:Working_with_pattern_matching)

> [!WARNING]
> Always be extremely careful when using the SLNetClientTest tool, as it can have far-reaching consequences on the functionality of your DataMiner System.
