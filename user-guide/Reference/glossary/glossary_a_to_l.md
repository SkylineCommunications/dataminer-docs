| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| LAN | Local Area Network. Network connecting devices within a limited area. |
| Latch level | The previous highest alarm severity level of a DataMiner object.<br>See [Special icon settings](xref:Main_Cube_UI_components_prior_to_DataMiner_10#special-icon-settings). |
| LDAP | Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. Cross-platform protocol used for directory services authentication. |
