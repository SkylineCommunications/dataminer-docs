| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation. Syntax for storing and exchanging data. |

## K

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Key point | The exact location in a signal chain where an error has occurred. E.g. “Encoding”, “Decoding”, “Reception”, etc.<br>See [Creating an information template](xref:Creating_an_information_template) and [Adding a violation filter](xref:Configuring_the_alarm_settings_for_an_SLA#adding-a-violation-filter). |
| KML | Keyhole Markup Language. XML notation used in map browsers such as Google Maps. |
| KPI | Key Performance Indicator. Performance measurement that indicates how well something is performing. |

## L

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| LAN | Local Area Network. Network connecting devices within a limited area. |
| Latch level | The previous highest alarm severity level of a DataMiner object.<br>See [Special icon settings](xref:Main_Cube_UI_components_prior_to_DataMiner_10#special-icon-settings). |
| LDAP | Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. Cross-platform protocol used for directory services authentication. |
