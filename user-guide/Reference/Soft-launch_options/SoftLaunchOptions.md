# Soft-launch options

Soft-launch features are DataMiner features that have not yet been made available to the general public, but by [activating specific options](xref:Activating_Soft_Launch_Options) you can access them already. However, before you do so, read the disclaimer below:

- Make sure you validate soft-launch features on your **staging platform**, and do not activate them on your production system unless you have synced with Skyline to make an assessment on the risk.

- **No backwards compatibility** is guaranteed for these features. This means that if they require setup work, you may have to redo your work once the functionality is effectively released.

- These features typically have **not been stress tested** yet.

- **Hotfixes will not be provided** for soft-launch features. The only way to get a fix for them is by installing the latest feature release.

If you accept these limitations, feel tree to activate the [soft-launch options of your choice](xref:Overview_of_Soft_Launch_Options). And obviously, your feedback on these preview features will be much appreciated.
