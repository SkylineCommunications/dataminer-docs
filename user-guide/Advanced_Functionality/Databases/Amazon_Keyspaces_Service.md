# Amazon Keyspaces Service

From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU0]/10.3.2 onwards, it is possible to use the Amazon Keyspaces Service on AWS. You can use this as an alternative for a Cassandra Cluster setup (see [Supported system data storage architectures](xref:Supported_system_data_storage_architectures)).

## Configuring TLS

For Amazon Keyspaces, the Starfield certificate must be present on the local Windows machine DataMiner is running on. To install the certificate, you will need to add it to the *Trusted Root Certification Authorities* section of the Windows certificate store:

1. Download the [sf-class2-root.crt certificate file](https://certs.secureserver.net/repository/sf-class2-root.crt).

1. On the machine where you want to import the certificate, press Windows + R and enter the `mmc` command.

   This will open a Console window. You may need to confirm that you want to allow the app to make changes to the device before the window is opened.

1. In the Console window, go to *File* > *Add/Remove Snap-in*.

1. In the *Available snap-ins* list, select *Certificates*, and then click *Add >*.

1. Select *Computer account* and click *Next*.

1. Make sure *Local computer* is selected and click *Finish*.

1. Click *OK*.

1. In the *Console Root* tree view on the left, select the folder *Certificates (Local Computer)* > *Trusted Root Certification Authorities* > *Certificates*.

1. Right-click the *Certificates* folder you have just selected and select *All Tasks* > *Import*.

1. Click *Next* until you can browse to the location of the certificate file.

1. Keep selecting *Next* or *Finish* until the certificate is successfully imported.

   You should now see the certificate listed as indicated in the example screenshot below.

## Connecting your DMS to your Amazon Keyspaces database

To configure the connection to an Amazon Keyspaces database, configure the settings as detailed under [Amazon Keyspaces database](xref:Configuring_the_database_settings_in_Cube#amazon-keyspaces-database)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An Amazon Keyspaces database requires a separate indexing database.
>
> For information on how to configure an indexing database, see [ElasticSearch database](xref:Elasticsearch_database).
