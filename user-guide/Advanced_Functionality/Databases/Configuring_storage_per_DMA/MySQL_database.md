# MySQL database

On legacy DataMiner Systems, typically a MySQL (or MSSQL) database is used as the general database. To have access to all the latest DataMiner features, switching to [Storage as a Service (STaaS)](xref:STaaS) is highly recommended. For this, you first need to [migrate to Cassandra](xref:Migrating_the_general_database_to_Cassandra). If you choose to keep using self-hosted storage, migrating to Cassandra is also highly recommended.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> MSSQL is no longer supported as the general database as from DataMiner 10.3.0.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on how to query a MySQL database, see [Querying an SQL database](xref:Querying_an_SQL_database) and [Querying a Cassandra database compared to MySQL](xref:Querying_Cassandra_vs_MySQL).
