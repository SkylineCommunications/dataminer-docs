# Setting up an indexing database in a setup with storage per DMA

Alongside a Cassandra database per DMA setup, you can install an Elasticsearch indexing database per DMA to get access to additional DataMiner features such as GQI, DOM, SRM, etc.

For instructions on how to deploy and configure the Elasticsearch indexing database, see [Setting up an Elasticsearch database in a setup with storage per DMA](xref:Configuring_indexing_database_per_DMS).
