# Configuring Elasticsearch backups

Backups of the Elasticsearch database are not included in a DataMiner restore package.

There are two methods to configure Elasticsearch backups:

- [Taking and restoring snapshots](xref:Configuring_Elasticsearch_backups_Windows_Linux): We strongly recommend that you use this method. It is applicable to both Windows and Linux.

- [Restoring backups using the Standalone Elastic Backup Tool](xref:Configuring_Elasticsearch_backups_Windows): This method can only be used with a Windows setup.
