# About databases

DataMiner supports multiple different [system data storage architectures](xref:Supported_system_data_storage_architectures).

Each DataMiner System requires its own system data storage. This data storage serves as a repository for configuration data, historical parameter information, and alarm data.

- Soon it will be possible to use **Storage as a Service** [(STaaS)](xref:STaaS) on dataminer.services for this, so you no longer have to maintain the databases yourself, and all the scaling and complexity is taken care of for you.

- At present, it is possible to configure a **dedicated clustered storage setup**, using a [Cassandra-compatible database service](xref:Cassandra_database) and an [indexing database](xref:Indexing_Database) (i.e. a Search Cluster).

- Instead of a dedicated clustered storage setup, it is also possible to configure **storage per DMA** ([Cassandra](xref:Migrating_the_general_database_to_Cassandra) or [MySQL](xref:MySQL_database)). If you have an existing legacy DataMiner System with SQL database, we highly recommend migrating to Cassandra to gain access to additional DataMiner features.

- If you use a Cassandra database per DMA, it is possible to configure an **indexing database per DMS**, an [Elasticsearch database](xref:Configuring_indexing_database_per_DMS) used to store specific data for features such as the Jobs and Dashboards app. Installing an Elasticsearch indexing database unlocks numerous additional DataMiner features, such as GQI, SRM, and more.

In addition to the system databases, you can also configure an [offload database](xref:Offload_database), for example to produce reports without interfering with the live DataMiner System. [Additional databases](xref:Configuring_an_additional_database) can also be configured, for example for DataMiner Inventory & Asset Management.

> [!NOTE]
> When the main database is offline, file offloads are used to store write/delete operations. You can configure a limit for the file size of these offloads in the file [DBConfiguration.xml](xref:DBConfiguration_xml).
