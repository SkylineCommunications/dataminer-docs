# Configuring an additional database

Aside from the general and offload database, you can also specify the settings for any other database found on a particular DMA.

To do so:

1. In Cube, go to *System Center \>* *Database* > *Other*.

1. Click *Add*, enter the name of the database, and click *Add*.

1. Select the *Activate this database* checkbox

1. Enter the necessary information.

   The fields that can be filled in are the same as for the general database. See [Configuring the database settings in Cube](xref:Configuring_the_database_settings_in_Cube).

1. Click *Save*

> [!NOTE]
> The other databases can be located on a different hardware platform and linked to the DMA over IP.
