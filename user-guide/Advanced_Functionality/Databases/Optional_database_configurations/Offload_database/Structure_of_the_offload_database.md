## iStatus values

In the data and dataavg tables of a DataMiner database, the iStatus field of a trending record provides information about that particular record.

Apart from three positive values, the iStatus field can contain a number of negative values providing information that, in most cases, will be used to avoid an incorrect graphical representation of a parameter’s trend data when building trend graphs.

| Value | Description |
|--|--|
| 120 | In case of average trending: The table entry contains average/max/min values calculated based on the parameter values measured during the last day. |
| 60 | In case of average trending: The table entry contains average/max/min values calculated based on parameter values measured during the last 60 minutes. |
| 5 | In case of average trending: The table entry contains average/max/min values calculated based on parameter values measured during the last 5 minutes. |
| 0 | In case of real-time trending: The table entry contains normal real-time trend data without additional information. |
| -1 | Element is starting up. |
| -2 | Element is being paused. |
| -3 | Element is being activated. |
| -4 | Element is going into a timeout state. |
| -5 | Element is coming out of a timeout state. |
| -6 | Element is being stopped. |
| -7 | A state and a display value (e.g. “No signal”) was received (separated by a semicolon). |
| -8 | A normal value was received following a “-7”. |
| -9 | Trending was started for the specified Parameter. |
| -10 | Trending was stopped for the specified Parameter |
| -11 | The parameter value was cleared. |
| -12 | The parameter again received a value following a “-11”. |
| -13 | The parameter value is the first value received for the parameter in question since the element was started. |
| -14 | The parameter value is the first value received for the parameter in question since the element was started. However, that value is an exception value. |
| -15 | A new row has been added to the dynamic table in question. |
| -16 | A row has been deleted from the dynamic table in question. |
| -17 | Monitoring has been activated. |
| -18 | Monitoring has been deactivated. |
