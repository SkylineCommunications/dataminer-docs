# OpenSearch database

From DataMiner 10.3(CU0) and 10.3.1 onwards, it is possible to install a dedicated OpenSearch indexing database cluster as an alternative for Elasticsearch. This cluster also requires a Cassandra Cluster.

## Compatibility

Supported versions: 1.0.0 - 2.3.0.

> [!NOTE]
> No Elasticsearch setups on AWS OpenSearch Service are currently supported.
