# Migrating the general database to a DMS Cassandra cluster

From DataMiner 10.1.0/10.1.2 onwards, you can use a single Cassandra cluster as the general database for the entire DataMiner System, along with an Elasticsearch database. This "Cassandra cluster" setup is the recommended data storage setup for DataMiner, as it allows you to scale the database for the entire DMS at once, unlike setups with a Cassandra cluster per individual DataMiner Agent.

## Limitations

- .dmimport packages created on a DMS using a Cassandra cluster do not contain any database data, and it is not possible to import database data from .dmimport packages into such a DMS.

- If the Cassandra cluster feature is used, alarm and information event information is always migrated to Elasticsearch. It is not possible to use this feature without enabling indexing on alarms.

## Installation and configuration

Regardless of whether your DataMiner System currently uses **SQL databases or Cassandra databases per DMA**, you can use the **Cassandra Cluster Migrator** to switch to a Cassandra cluster setup. In DataMiner versions prior to 10.2.0/10.2.2, a Cassandra to Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool was available; however, we highly recommend that you upgrade to DataMiner 10.2.0 CU8 or 10.2.11 (or higher) and use the Cassandra Cluster Migrator instead.

The migration can be done while the DMAs are active; however, a **DataMiner restart** will be required after all data has been migrated.

The Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool (called *SLCCMigrator.exe*) is available on every DMA running DataMiner version 10.2.0/10.2.2 or higher. You can find it in the folder `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Tools\`. However, we highly recommend that you upgrade to DataMiner 10.2.0 CU8 or 10.2.11 (or higher) to use the tool, as this version includes an improved version of the tool that will prevent possible issues.

### Prerequisites

- All DMAs must run DataMiner 10.2.0/10.2.2 or higher.

- A Cassandra cluster must be available using version 4.0 or higher. For information on how to install Cassandra, see [Installing Cassandra on a Linux machine](xref:Installing_Cassandra).

> [!NOTE]
> Previously Cassandra 3.11.8 was also supported. This will remain supported for existing installations; however, because of its increased performance, **Cassandra 4.0 is required for new Cassandra installations** if a database per cluster is used. If you have a Cassandra 3.11.8 database and you have not yet migrated your DataMiner data, we recommend upgrading to Cassandra 4.0 first.

- An Elasticsearch cluster must be available using version 6.8.0 or higher, but lower than 7.0. For information on how to configure an Elasticsearch cluster, see [Configuring the Elasticsearch database](xref:Configuring_Elasticsearch_Database).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The **migration will not clear any existing data from the given Cassandra cluster**. This means that any data that might conflict with the migrated data should first be deleted manually. We recommend that you make sure the target Cassandra cluster is clean before you proceed with the migration. You can use DevCenter to inspect the data in the cluster and any existing keyspaces and/or tables can be dropped.
> - If there is an **existing Elasticsearch cluster** connected to the DMS, this cluster will be reused and any given input regarding Elasticsearch will be disregarded. In the existing Elasticsearch cluster, alarms will be deleted and migrated again from the DMS. Jobs, ticketing and SRM information will not be migrated, as this is expected to already be present in Elasticsearch. If this is not the case, migrate this data first through DataMiner Cube (see [Configuring indexing settings in System Center](xref:Configuring_DataMiner_Indexing)).

### Stages of the migration

During the migration, each DMA will go through the following stages:

| State | Description |
|--|--|
| Not initialized | The default state of a DMA. It has not been initialized for migration to a Cassandra and Elasticsearch cluster. |
| Initialized | The DMA has connected with the given Cassandra and Elasticsearch clusters and is ready to start data migration. |
| Migrating | The DMA is busy migrating data. Progress can be tracked using the migrator tool. |
| Finished migrating | The DMA has finished migrating and is ready for migration finalization, i.e. ready to switch to the Cassandra and Elasticsearch cluster configuration. |
| Finalized | The DMA has been restarted and switched to the Cassandra and Elasticsearch cluster configuration. |

### Running the migration

#### [Running a migration with bespoke Elasticsearch data](#tab/tabid-1)

In case your system contains bespoke Elasticsearch data or SRM data, use the procedure below.

1. Follow the step-by-step guide on [taking and restoring snapshots](xref:Configuring_Elasticsearch_backups_Windows_Linux).

   Make sure the snapshot has been [restored](xref:Configuring_Elasticsearch_backups_Windows_Linux#taking-the-snapshot) on the target Elasticsearch cluster.

1. Enter `http://[IP address]:9200/_cat/indices` in your browser's address bar. Replace "[IP address]" with your IP address.

   Take note of the prefixes used in the indices. You will need this information later. The default prefix is "dms".

   ![Prefix snapshot](~/user-guide/images/Prefix_Snapshot.png)

1. Stop your DataMiner System.

1. Open the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\db.xml` file and check if `<DataBase type="Elasticsearch">` exists.

   Example:

   ```xml
   <DataBases xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="http://www.skyline.be/config/db">
      ...
      <DataBase active="true" search="true" type="Elasticsearch">
         <DBServer>10.2.1.5</DBServer>
         <UID/>
         <PWD/>
      </DataBase>
      ...
   </DataBases>
   ```

   If you find `<DataBase type="Elasticsearch">`, replace the entries in the `<DBServer>` tag with a list of all the nodes in the target Elasticsearch cluster, separated by commas.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you do not find `<Database type="Elasticsearch">` in the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\db.xml` file, switch to the tab on [running a regular migration](#running-the-migration).

1. Restart your DataMiner System.

1. Verify whether the snapshot restore worked by confirming that [bookings](xref:The_Bookings_module), [jobs](xref:jobs), and other custom data in Cube are still functional.

1. Navigate to `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Tools\\`, and run *SLCCMigrator.exe*.

1. Initialize all the DMAs in the list. You can initialize all DMAs at once using the *Initialize all agents* button or initialize them one at a time with the *Initialize* button for each DMA.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If one or more DMAs fail to be initialized, contact your Skyline Technical Account Manager to resolve this issue, or refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below for the solution.

1. In the pop-up window, enter the Cassandra and Elasticsearch settings, and click *Confirm*.

   The following settings are required:

   - Cassandra settings:

     - *Cassandra IP(s)*: The IPs of the Cassandra cluster nodes. For example: `10.11.1.70,10.11.2.70,10.11.3.70` or `10.11.1.70:9042` or `CC-NODE-01,CC-NODE-02`.

     - *Keyspace prefix*: The prefix for the Cassandra keyspaces. Enter `cassandra_prefix_here`.

     - *Cassandra user*: The Cassandra username.

     - *Cassandra password*: The password for the specified username.

     - *Cassandra consistency*: The consistency level. For more information, see [How is the consistency level configured?](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/dml/dmlConfigConsistency.html)

       > [!NOTE]
       >
       > - If there are less than 4 nodes, we recommend setting this to *One*.
       > - If there are more than 4 nodes, we recommend setting this to [Quorum](xref:replication_and_consistency_configuration#examples).

   - Elasticsearch settings: These are not used in case there already is an Elasticsearch cluster connected to your DMS. In that case, you can just fill in dummy data.

     - *Elastic IP(s)*: The IPs of the Elasticsearch cluster. For example: `10.11.1.70,10.11.2.70,10.11.3.70` or `10.11.1.70:9042` or `https://10.11.1.70:9042` or `ES-NODE-01,ES-NODE-02`.

     - *Database prefix*: The prefix for the Elasticsearch indices and aliases. Enter `elastic_prefix_here`.

       > [!NOTE]
       > When you enter "elastic_prefix_here", DataMiner will use the same prefix as mentioned in step 2 to identify the data it owns. If a different prefix is entered, it will be impossible to use the migrated data.

     - *Elastic user*: The Elasticsearch username.

     - *Elastic password*: The password for the specified username. This is not mandatory, unless manually specified.

1. Once the DMAs have been initialized, start the migration. You can do this for all DMAs at once with the *Start Migration* button at the top, or for one DMA at a time by clicking the *Details* button for that DMA and selecting *Migrate all storages*.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Make sure no data is overwritten or removed during the migration.

1. During the migration, you can monitor the progress in the main window of the tool. You can safely close the tool and open it again later. The migration process will continue even when you close *SLCCMigrator.exe*.

1. When the migration has finished, check the main window of *SLCCMigrator.exe* and make sure there are no errors.

1. When no errors are reported, click *Finalize migration* to restart all DMAs.

1. Verify whether all data in Cube is still present and functional.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - During the migration, you can cancel the migration of one particular data type for one particular DMA. This will not undo any changes made to the Cassandra and Elasticsearch clusters.
> - If you want to cancel the entire migration process for all DMAs, click *Abort migration*. This will undo all changes made to the DMAs.
> - When you migrate a DataMiner Failover setup, only the data of the active DMA will be migrated. Once the migration has finished, both DMAs will be restarted.

#### [Running a regular migration](#tab/tabid-2)

1. On one of the DMAs in your cluster, go to `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Tools\`, and run *SLCCMigrator.exe*.

1. Initialize all the DMAs in the list. You can initialize all DMAs at once using the *Initialize all agents* button or initialize them one at a time with the *Initialize* button for each DMA.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If one or more DMAs fail to be initialized, please contact your Skyline Technical Account Manager to resolve this issue, or refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below for the solution.

1. In the pop-up window, enter the Cassandra and Elasticsearch settings, and click *Confirm*. The following settings are required:

   - Cassandra settings:

     - *Cassandra IP(s)*: The IPs of the Cassandra cluster nodes. For example: `10.11.1.70,10.11.2.70,10.11.3.70` or `10.11.1.70:9042` or `CC-NODE-01,CC-NODE-02`.

     - *Keyspace prefix*: The prefix for the Cassandra keyspaces. (At most 10 characters.) For example: `dms01`.

     - *Cassandra user*: The Cassandra username.

     - *Cassandra password*: The password for the specified username.

     - *Cassandra consistency*: The consistency level. For more information, see [How is the consistency level configured?](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/dml/dmlConfigConsistency.html)

   - Elasticsearch settings: These are not used in case there already is an Elasticsearch cluster connected to your DMS. In that case, you can just fill in dummy data.

     - *Elastic IP(s)*: The IPs of the Elasticsearch cluster. For example: `10.11.1.70,10.11.2.70,10.11.3.70` or `10.11.1.70:9042` or `https://10.11.1.70:9042` or `ES-NODE-01,ES-NODE-02`.

     - *Database prefix*: The prefix for the Elasticsearch indices and aliases. For example: `dms`.

     - *Elastic user*: The Elasticsearch username.

     - *Elastic password*: The password for the specified username.

1. Once the DMAs have been initialized, start the migration. You can do this for all DMAs at once with the *Start Migration* button at the top, or for one DMA at a time by clicking the *Details* button for that DMA and selecting *Migrate all storages*.

1. During the migration, you can monitor the progress in the main window of the tool. You can safely close the tool and open it again later. The migration process will continue even when you close *SLCCMigrator.exe*.

1. When the migration has finished, check the main window of *SLCCMigrator.exe* and make sure there are no errors.

1. When no errors are reported, click *Finalize migration* to restart all DMAs.

### Troubleshooting

Any errors that occur during a migration process will be displayed in a pop-up window and stored in a log file.

- To open the log file of the *SLCCMigrator.exe* tool, at the top of the main window, click *Open log file*.

- To check the migration server logging, go to `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Logging` and open *SLDBConnection.txt*.

If you encounter **issues when you start a migration** (e.g. “No connection with DataMiner”), check the following NATS message broker log files:

- `C:/Skyline DataMiner/Logging/SLMessageBroker.txt`
- `C:/Skyline DataMiner/Logging/SLMessageBroker.Crash.txt`

If you encounter an **issue initializing all the Agents**, check whether the logging of the *SLCCMigrator.exe* tool contains a line mentioning "*No responders are available for the request.*". Alternatively, you can also identify this issue by going to `http://<ip>:8222/varz` and checking if the "cluster" tag mentions all the IPs in the cluster. To resolve this issue:

1. Make sure all Agents are online.
1. Open the [SLNetClientTest tool](xref:SLNetClientTest_tool), and connect to the Agent that is not initialized.
1. In the *Build Message* tab, send a *NatsCustodianResetNatsRequest* (leaving the *IsDistributed* property set to false).
1. Initialize the Agents again and continue with the migration procedure, as detailed above.

> [!CAUTION]
> Always be very careful when you use the SLNetClientTest tool, as it allows actions that can have far-reaching consequences for a DataMiner System. Always ask for support in case you need to use this tool and something is not clear.

## Cluster health monitoring

If a Cassandra node in the cluster goes down or if a Cassandra node is down when DataMiner starts up, an alarm will be generated in the Alarm Console. This alarm also indicates how much the health of the cluster is affected by the node being down, as this depends on multiple factors, including the cluster size and replication factor.

## Customizing the consistency level of the Cassandra cluster

When the Cassandra cluster feature is used, you can customize the consistency level for the Cassandra queries. You can do so as follows:

1. Shut down the DMA.

1. Open the file *DB.xml* from the directory *C:\\Skyline DataMiner* in a text editor.

1. In the `<Database>` tag, add the *consistencyLevel="x"* attribute, and set it to the consistency level you want, e.g. *two*.

   The following consistency levels are supported: Any, One, Two, Three, Quorum, All, LocalQuorum, EachQuorum, Serial, LocalSerial, LocalOne. The default setting is "Quorum".

   > [!NOTE]
   > Together with the replication factor, the consistency level determines the maximum number of nodes that can be down before data unavailability occurs. For more information, see [Data replication and consistency configuration](xref:replication_and_consistency_configuration).

1. Restart DataMiner.

> [!CAUTION]
> Only change this attribute for a Cassandra Cluster setup. If you change it for a standard Cassandra setup with one Cassandra cluster per DMA, this can cause DataMiner to fail to start up.
