# Legacy setup with MySQL or MSSQL database

In legacy DataMiner Systems using DataMiner 9.0 or older, the data storage setup involved a MySQL or MSSQL database. However, to have access to all recent DataMiner features, one of the recommended setups mentioned above should be used instead.

While older features will continue to work with MySQL up to DataMiner 10.4.0, MSSQL is no longer supported as from DataMiner 10.3.0. For more information, see [Third-party software support life cycle](xref:Software_support_life_cycles#third-party-software-support-life-cycle).
