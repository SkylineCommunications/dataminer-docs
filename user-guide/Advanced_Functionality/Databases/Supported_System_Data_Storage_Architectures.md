# Supported system data storage architectures

By default, DataMiner uses a Cassandra and Elasticsearch database for system data storage. Other data storage solutions can be added optionally, for example to offload data from the DataMiner System and to make it available for third-party systems. For more information, see [Data Storage Architecture](https://community.dataminer.services/data-storage-architecture/).

For the system data storage, different setups are supported, as described below. In these setups, a "machine" or "compute node" can be a virtual machine or a physical server. Every machine must meet the minimum requirements detailed in [DataMiner Compute Requirements](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-compute-requirements/).

In the images illustrating the setups, the dark-blue line indicates a cluster of nodes, the gray line indicates a compute node, and the light-blue line indicates a regional boundary (high latency).

If you would like to use a setup that is not described below, please contact [Skyline tech support](mailto:techsupport@skyline.be).

## Cassandra Cluster setup with Elasticsearch

The **recommended** DataMiner setup involves **one Cassandra cluster and one Elasticsearch cluster for the entire DataMiner System** (DMS). This allows you to scale the database for the entire DMS at once, unlike setups with a Cassandra cluster per individual DataMiner Agent (DMA).

> [!TIP]
> For information on how to implement this setup based on an existing DataMiner setup with SQL or Cassandra databases per DMA, see [Migrating the general database to a DMS Cassandra cluster](xref:Migrating_the_general_database_to_a_DMS_Cassandra_cluster)

### Single DMA setups

In a development environment with limited load, it is possible to host DataMiner, Cassandra, and Elasticsearch on one Windows machine. In this case, Elasticsearch and DataMiner must be installed on a separate disk or partition. However, note that this is not recommended for normal production environments.

![Development setup: DataMiner, Cassandra, and Elasticsearch hosted on the same machine](~/user-guide/images/Development-setup-DataMiner-Cassandra-and-Elasticsearch.png)<br>
*Development setup: DataMiner, Cassandra, and Elasticsearch hosted on the same machine*

Instead, we recommend running DataMiner, Cassandra, and Elasticsearch on dedicated machines.

The Elasticsearch cluster should consist of at least 3 nodes, running on Windows or Linux machines. While it is possible to use one single Elasticsearch node, this means you will miss out on the replication features.

For Cassandra, any number of nodes can be used, ideally running on Linux machines. To get an idea of how many nodes would be required for your system, use the [node calculator](https://community.dataminer.services/calculator/).

### Multiple DMA (non-Failover) setups

In case you have more than one DataMiner Agent, you can scale on three levels: DataMiner, Cassandra, and Elasticsearch.

The Elasticsearch cluster should ideally consist of at least 3 nodes, running on Windows or Linux machines. While it is possible to use one single Elasticsearch node, this means you will miss out on the replication features. Running two nodes is not supported.

While we recommend running the DataMiner and Elasticsearch nodes on separate machines, it is also possible to host a DataMiner and Elasticsearch node on the same machine. Note that in that case it is not required to install an Elasticsearch node on every single DataMiner node. While compute resources can be shared, logically there still is a separate DataMiner node cluster and Elasticsearch cluster.

For Cassandra, any number of nodes can be used, ideally running on Linux machines. To get an idea of how many nodes would be required for your system, use the [node calculator](https://community.dataminer.services/calculator/).

### Failover setups (without geo-redundancy)

A Failover setup is similar to the previously mentioned setups. You can consider the Failover pair to be like one DMA in the DMS. Both DataMiner instances point to the same Cassandra and Elasticsearch cluster. With this setup, you both get the DataMiner resilience and resilience in your Cassandra and Elasticsearch cluster.

As an absolute minimum, such a system could consist of two DataMiner machines, one Elasticsearch machine and one Cassandra machine. However, if the Cassandra or Elasticsearch machine are no longer available in this setup, you will no longer be able to start DataMiner, so this is not recommended for redundancy setups.

To be fully hardware-redundant, we recommend at least three machines hosting Elasticsearch nodes, two machines hosting the DataMiner Failover pair and two machines hosting Cassandra nodes. More Cassandra and Elasticsearch nodes can be needed depending on the load on your system. Check the [node calculator](https://community.dataminer.services/calculator/) for more information.

Note that in a Failover setup, it is bad practice to host the Elasticsearch nodes and DataMiner nodes on the same machine, as this would not allow you to get the desired resilience.

### Failover setups (with geo-redundancy)

To achieve geo-redundancy and reduce latency between DMAs deployed across the globe, typically data center setups are used. In case you need a setup with multiple data centers deployed worldwide, please contact Skyline.

Setting up an Elasticsearch cluster across high-latency nodes is not advised. This is a strict constraint from Elastic in order not to compromise proper functionality. As such, it is not possible to simply take Elasticsearch nodes and spread them out over two or more locations if there is high latency between those locations. Note that this restriction specifically applies to latency between the Elasticsearch nodes, not between the DataMiner nodes and the Elasticsearch nodes. This is why we recommend that instead data is offloaded to multiple Elasticsearch clusters.

The figure below illustrates the recommended minimum setup for geo-redundancy. For Cassandra, the built-in [NetworkTopologyStrategy](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/4.0/cassandra/cql/ddl.html#networktopologystrategy) is used in order to configure geo-redundancy. For Elasticsearch, an option is available from DataMiner 10.1.3 onwards to push data from the DMS to two separate, geo-redundant Elasticsearch clusters. When one of the database clusters is temporarily unavailable, DataMiner will offload the data towards files to prevent data loss. Note that with this option, if there is an inconsistency between the two Elasticsearch clusters, it will not be synced.

![Recommended minimum setup for a geo-redundant system](~/user-guide/images/setup-for-a-geo-redundant-system.png)<br>
*Recommended minimum setup for a geo-redundant system*

Aside from the minimum setup illustrated above, there are several options for a geo-redundant Failover setup with Elasticsearch, although at present not all of these are supported in DataMiner yet.

The following options are currently not supported:

- An optional paid feature of Elasticsearch supports the replication of data between two Elasticsearch clusters with high latency between them. However, this option is currently not supported by DataMiner and would come with a price tag, as this is a paid feature. For information on the cost of this feature, we recommend that you contact Elastic for an accurate quotation.

- Integrating Kafka and Logstash, as [described by Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/blog/scaling_elasticsearch_across_data_centers_with_kafka), is not available in DataMiner, and it is currently not on the roadmap for future releases.

An alternative option, which is available from DataMiner 10.1.1 onwards, is to host the Elasticsearch cluster in a cloud environment. Plenty of cloud providers are available for this. In a first iteration, the [AWS Elasticsearch Service](https://community.dataminer.services/elasticsearch-7-x-aws-compatibility/?hilite=%27AWS%27%2C%27OpenSearch%27%2C%27Service%27) is supported.

## Standard Cassandra setup with Elasticsearch

This architecture is currently still supported, though it is **not recommended**. In this case, **each DMA has its own Cassandra database** (which can be a cluster with several nodes). However, only one Elasticsearch cluster is used for the entire DMS.

In a development environment with limited load, it is possible to host DataMiner, Cassandra, and Elasticsearch on one Windows machine. In this case, Elasticsearch and DataMiner must be installed on a separate disk or partition. However, this is not recommended for normal production environments.

## Standard Cassandra setup without Elasticsearch

This architecture is currently still supported, though it is **not recommended**. In this case, **each DMA has its own Cassandra database** (which can be a cluster with several nodes). No Elasticsearch database is used, which means that certain DataMiner features will not be available. For more information, see [Data Storage Architecture](https://community.dataminer.services/data-storage-architecture/).

> [!TIP]
> For information on how to migrate a legacy setup with MySQL/MSSQL database to Cassandra, see [Migrating the general database to Cassandra](xref:Migrating_the_general_database_to_Cassandra).

By default, Cassandra is installed on the same machine as DataMiner. However, when your system has a high load, it is strongly recommended to move the Cassandra database towards an external (Windows or Linux) machine. This way, DataMiner and Cassandra do not affect each other during heavy operations. The best way to do so is by adding one or more external nodes to the Cassandra cluster and then decommissioning the original node on the DataMiner machine. See [Scaling a Cassandra cluster database](xref:Scale_Cassandra_Database).

In case Cassandra struggles with the load generated by DataMiner, you can add additional Cassandra nodes. In that case, DataMiner will connect to one of the nodes, which will act as a coordinator that makes sure the data is stored in the appropriate nodes.

In case of a DataMiner Failover pair, the Cassandra nodes on each of the DMAs are grouped in a cluster, which can be customized. It is the active DMA that connects with the Cassandra database.

*Failover pair with external Cassandra database of three nodes*

> [!NOTE]
> If a "Database per Agent" setup is configured, one Cassandra cluster is used per Failover pair. Consequently, if a DMS consists of a single Failover pair, it will use a single Cassandra cluster, even if it is not a "Database per cluster" setup. The main difference with a "Database per cluster" setup (also known as a "Cassandra Cluster setup") in this case is that no Elasticsearch database is required, while this is always required for a "Database per cluster" setup.

## Legacy setup with MySQL or MSSQL database

In legacy DataMiner Systems using DataMiner 9.0 or older, the data storage setup involved a MySQL or MSSQL database. However, to have access to all recent DataMiner features, one of the recommended setups mentioned above should be used instead.

While older features will continue to work with MySQL up to DataMiner 10.4.0, MSSQL is no longer supported as from DataMiner 10.3.0. For more information, see [Third-Party Software Support Life Cycle](https://community.dataminer.services/3rd-party-software-support-life-cycle/).
