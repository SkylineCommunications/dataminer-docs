# Amazon OpenSearch Service

From DataMiner 10.3(CU0)/10.3.1 onwards, it is possible to Amazon OpenSearch Service on AWS as an alternative to a on-prem hosted Elasticsearch/OpenSearch cluster.

## Compatibility

Supported versions:

- OpenSearch version 1.3.

> [!NOTE]
> No Elasticsearch setups on Amazon OpenSearch Service are currently supported.

## Create your Amazon OpenSearch Service domain

1. Go to [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in.
1. Go to [Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/).
1. Create your domain

![Create Domain](~/user-guide/images/Amazon_OpenSearch_CreateDomain.png)

Configure your domain with the appropriate settings.
Make sure to select `Production` for `Deployment type`, OpenSearch version 1.3 and at least 3 nodes.

Also keep `compatibility mode` disabled.

In the fine-grained access control settings, choose `Create master user`.

Provide a user name and password. Make sure to store this information somewhere as you are going to need it later to connect from Cube.

New domains typically take 15â€“30 minutes to initialize, but can take longer depending on the configuration. After your domain initializes, select it to open its configuration pane.

Note the domain endpoint under General information.

## Connect your DMS to your Amazon OpenSearch Service domain

1. Ensure your DMS is up and running
1. Connect with Cube to your DMS and go to System Center -> Database

Configure your OpenSearch cluster together with your Cassandra Cluster as a `Database per cluster`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure your server version is compatible for OpenSearch. Cube will display `Elasticsearch/OpenSearch` instead of `Elasticsearch` if your server is compatible.
>
> Since TLS will be enabled on AWS, the `DB Server` must be the full url, starting with https and ending with the port. For Amazon OpenSearch Service this means port 443, for example: `https://search-mydomain-123456798.eu-north-1.es.amazonaws.com:443/`

## Restart the entire DMS

Restart the entire DMS so the configuration can take place.

## (Optional) Verify that the DMS is using the database

Open the `OpenSearch Dashboards URL` which will redirect you to your dashboard (equivalent of Kibana for Elasticsearch).

If you navigate to Management -> Dev Tools in the hamburger menu, you can execute the query `GET _cat/indices` and you should see that the DMS has created the necessary indices.

> [!NOTE]
> In the example screenshots, the cluster health is yellow because only 1 node is used and 1 node clusters are always yellow.
