# Setting up an Elasticsearch database in a setup with storage per DMA

If you choose not to use the recommended [Storage as a Service (STaaS)](xref:STaaS) setup but instead want to use a self-hosted storage setup with a Cassandra database per DataMiner Agent, you should also install an Elasticsearch indexing database per DMS in order to get access to additional DataMiner features, including GQI, DOM, and SRM.

You can [deploy the Elasticsearch indexing database](xref:Installing_Elasticsearch_via_DataMiner) via DataMiner Cube. When the database has been deployed, you can also [configure the indexing settings](xref:Configuring_DataMiner_Indexing) in DataMiner Cube.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Elasticsearch is only supported up to version 6.8. As a consequence, if you do want to use self-hosted storage instead of [STaaS](xref:STaaS), we recommend using [dedicated clustered storage](xref:Dedicated_clustered_storage) with OpenSearch or the Amazon OpenSearch Service on AWS.

> [!NOTE]
> For information on the system requirements for Elasticsearch, refer to [DataMiner Compute Requirements](xref:DataMiner_Compute_Requirements).
