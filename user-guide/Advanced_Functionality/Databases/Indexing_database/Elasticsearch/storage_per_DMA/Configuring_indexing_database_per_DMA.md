# Setting up an Elasticsearch database in a setup with storage per DMA

If your DataMiner System uses a Cassandra database per DataMiner Agent, you can also install an Elasticsearch indexing database per DMS in order to get access to additional DataMiner features, including GQI, DOM, and SRM.

You can [deploy the Elasticsearch indexing database](xref:Installing_Elasticsearch_via_DataMiner) via DataMiner Cube. When the database has been deployed, you can also [configure the indexing settings](xref:Configuring_DataMiner_Indexing) in DataMiner Cube.

> [!NOTE]
> For information on the system requirements for Elasticsearch, refer to [DataMiner Compute Requirements](xref:DataMiner_Compute_Requirements).
