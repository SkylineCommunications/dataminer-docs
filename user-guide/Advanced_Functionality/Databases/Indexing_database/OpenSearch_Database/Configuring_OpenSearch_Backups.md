# Configuring OpenSearch backups

This procedure to configure an OpenSearch database backup focuses on setting up and using an OpenSearch snapshot to back up and restore OpenSearch data.

## Requirements

You will need a client application that is able to communicate with the OpenSearch rest API. This application must be able to send POST and PUT messages with a request body.

Examples:

- OpenSearch Dashboards: [OpenSearch Dashboards](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/index/) is often used together with OpenSearch.

- CURL: [Curl](https://curl.se/) is a simple command-line utility that allows messages with payload (e.g. POST and PUT messages) and is useful for scripting.

- [Elasticvue](https://elasticvue.com/)

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/rest-client/)

- ...

## Setting up a shared folder

In this procedure, we will be using an [NFS server](#nfs-server) and [NFS client](#nfs-client) to establish a shared folder accessible by all OpenSearch nodes. This shared folder allows all nodes to store snapshot data. Use an NFS server and client as explained in [How to Set Up NFS Server and Client on CentOS 8](https://www.tecmint.com/install-nfs-server-on-centos-8/).

> [!TIP]
>
> - If required, contact your IT department to follow the NFS server setup procedure, as this step may otherwise be challenging. Further input on networking infrastructure may also be required.
> - It is also possible to set up an NFS share on Windows and share it with the destination Linux system. See [Windows Server 2016 as an NFS server for Linux clients](https://blog.bobbyallen.me/2018/01/18/windows-server-2016-as-an-nfs-server-for-linux-clients/).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - As this setup might be more challenging, we recommend that you set it up in advance.
> - Be wary of read, write, and execute rights, firewall configurations, and the state of the NFS server service during the setup. For the machines that will act as NFS servers, make sure the firewall allows NFS traffic. You can use the following command for this: `sudo ufw allow nfs`
> - Make sure the OpenSearch user has enough rights to the folder to read, write, and execute its contents.

1. Set up a shared folder on the source OpenSearch cluster for all nodes to contain the snapshots. This folder must be shared across all machines in the OpenSearch clusters in all directions.

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /var/nfs/opensearch -p
   ```

1. Give the folder the necessary permissions on all nodes.

   ```bash
   sudo chmod 777 /var/nfs/opensearch
   ```

   If you do not have enough rights to the shared folder, use the `chmod` and `chown` command.

   > [!NOTE]
   > It is possible you will need to contact your IT department to get more rights.

### NFS server

1. Install the NFS server packages on one of the nodes. We recommend using the *cluster_manager* node.
  
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
   ```

1. Configure the NFS server to share the folder with NFS clients by editing the `/etc/exports` file.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/exports
   ```

1. Add the following line to the `/etc/exports` file:

   ```txt
   /var/nfs/opensearch 166.206.186.0/24(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)
   ```

   - "166.206.186.0/24": This will allow all nodes/servers that are in the network-address range: 166.206.186.x and subnet mask 255.255.255.0.
  
   Save the file by pressing CTRL+O, then Enter, and exit the editor by pressing CTRL+X.

1. Restart the NFS server:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
   ```

### NFS client

1. Install the NFS client on each node:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nfs-common
   ```

1. Mount the shared folder on each node:

   ```bash
   sudo mount [NFSServerIP]:/var/nfs/opensearch /var/nfs/opensearch
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   sudo mount 166.206.186.146:/var/nfs/opensearch /var/nfs/opensearch
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > You do not need to perform the mounting step on the node that serves as the NFS server.
  
1. To make the mount persistent across server reboots, edit the `/etc/fstab` file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```

1. Add the following line to the file:

   ```txt
   [NFSServerIP]:/var/nfs/opensearch /var/nfs/opensearch nfs rw,_netdev,tcp 0 0
   ```
  
   Example:

   ```txt
   166.206.186.146:/var/nfs/opensearch /var/nfs/opensearch nfs rw,_netdev,tcp 0 0
   ```
  
1. Save the file by pressing CTRL+O, then Enter, and exit the editor by pressing CTRL+X.

1. Test if the mount was successful by running the following command:

   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

   The output of this command should display the mounted NFS share.

1. Create a test file in the mounted directory to verify accessibility:

   ```bash
   sudo touch /var/nfs/opensearch/test.txt
   ```

   This will create a file named "test.txt" that can be accessed from any other NFS client.

### Creating the snapshot repository

#### Creating the repository using REST API

1. Create a repository by executing the following PUT request in your client application (e.g. Elasticvue, Postman, etc.):

   ```txt
   PUT /_snapshot/opensearchbackup
   {
     "type": "fs",
     "settings": {
       "location": "/var/nfs/opensearch"
     }
   }
   ```

   - "/var/nfs/opensearch": The path of the shared folder you created

   - "opensearchbackup": A repository name of your choice

   > [!TIP]
   > For more information, see [Shared file system](https://opensearch.org/docs/2.8/tuning-your-cluster/availability-and-recovery/snapshots/snapshot-restore/#shared-file-system).

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also use ElasticVue to create your repository: Go to *Snapshots* > *Snapshot Repositories*, and click the *New repository* button. Then fill in the name and the repository location, and leave the default settings untouched (i.e. *Compress* should be enabled, and *Readonly* should be disabled).

1. Verify whether the repository has been created correctly by entering the following GET request using your chosen client application.

   ```txt
   GET _snapshot/opensearchbackup
   ```

   If the repository has been created correctly, the response will provide repository information.

   Example, using OpenSearch Dashboards as client application:

   ![Verify](~/user-guide/images/Get_Snapshot.png)

   - "opensearchbackup": Name of your snapshot repository

   - "fs": A file system repository

   - "/var/nfs/opensearch": The path where all snapshots are stored

   > [!TIP]
   > For more information, see [Get snapshot repository](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/snapshots/get-snapshot-repository/).

#### Creating the repository using OpenSearch Dashboards

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To be able to restore a snapshot later, you must go through these steps first. Without a functional repository, you will run into issues that will delay the snapshot restore.

1. Access the *opensearch.yml* file on all nodes of the OpenSearch cluster. Open the file and set *path.repo* as your previously created shared folder.

1. Open OpenSearch Dashboards. Click the hamburger button in the top-left corner and select *Snapshot Management*. In the left-hand pane, now select *Repositories* to view an overview of all repositories.

1. Select *Create repository* in the top-right corner.

   ![OpenSearch Dashboards - Repository Overview ](~/user-guide/images/OpenSearchDashboards_RepositoryOverview.svg)

1. Specify the following details:

   - **Repository name**: The name of your repository

   - **Repository type**: Set to *Shared file system*

   - **Location**: The location where your repository is saved

   Save all changes by clicking *Add*.

1. In the overview, you should now see your newly added repository.

## Taking the snapshot

### Taking the snapshot using REST API

1. Execute the following PUT request in your chosen client application:

   ```txt
   PUT /_snapshot/opensearchbackup/20230620
   {
   "indices": "*",
   "ignore_unavailable": true,
   "include_global_state": false,
   "partial": false
   }
   ```

   - "20230620": Name for the snapshot

   - "opensearchbackup": Name of your snapshot repository

   You can also add a request body to include or exclude certain indices or specify other settings. See [Take snapshots](https://opensearch.org/docs/2.8/tuning-your-cluster/availability-and-recovery/snapshots/snapshot-restore/#take-snapshots).

1. You cannot take a snapshot if another is currently in progress. To check the status, enter the following GET request:

   ```txt
   GET /_snapshot/_status
   ```

1. Verify that the snapshot was created successfully by entering the following GET request:

   ```txt
   GET /_snapshot/opensearchbackup/20230620
   ```

   The field next to *"state":* should display "SUCCESS".

You have now finished configuring an OpenSearch backup.

### Taking a snapshot using OpenSearch Dashboards

1. In OpenSearch Dashboards, click the hamburger button in the top-left corner and select *Snapshot Management*. In the left-hand pane, now select *Snapshots* to view an overview of all snapshots.

   ![OpenSearch Dashboards - Snapshot Overview](~/user-guide/images/OpenSearchDashboards_SnapshotOverview.png)

1. Select *Take snapshot* in the top-right corner.

1. Specify the following details:

   - **Snapshot name**: The name of the snapshot

   - **Select or input source indexes or index patterns**: Enter an asterisk ("*")

   - **Select a repository for snapshots**: The repository you created in [Creating a snapshot repository](#creating-the-snapshot-repository)

     ![OpenSearch Dashboards - Snapshot Overview](~/user-guide/images/OpenSearchDashboards_CreateSnapshot.png)

   Save all changes by clicking *Add*.

1. In the overview, you will now see your newly taken snapshot.

## Restoring the snapshot

> [!CAUTION]
> Restoring the snapshot can only be accomplished using the REST API. If you have used OpenSearch Dashboards to create the repository and take the snapshot, it is essential that you transition to employing REST API for this purpose.

1. Ensure that the target OpenSearch cluster is empty.

1. Open your chosen client application. To see all snapshots in your repository, execute:

   ```txt
   GET /_snapshot/[repositoryname]/_all
   ```

   Example:

   ```txt
   GET /_snapshot/opensearchbackup/_all
   ```

1. In the target OpenSearch cluster, execute the following POST request:

   ```txt
   POST /_snapshot/[repositoryname]/[snapshotname]/_restore
   {
     "indices": "[dbprefix]*"
   }
   ```

   - "dbprefix": The prefix specified in the *DB* tag for the indexing database in the *DB.xml* file (in the folder *C:\Skyline DataMiner\\*)

     > [!NOTE]
     > To find the prefix DataMiner puts in front of an index name, enter `http://[IP address]:9200/_cat/indices` in your browser's address bar. Replace "[IP address]" with your IP address.
     > ![prefix](~/user-guide/images/Prefix_Snapshot.png)

   Example:

   ```txt
   POST /_snapshot/opensearchbackup/20230620/_restore
   {
     "indices": "sldmadb*"
   }
   ```

   > [!CAUTION]
   > Because we are using the Security plugin in this procedure, make sure to carefully read [OpenSearch's security considerations](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/tuning-your-cluster/availability-and-recovery/snapshots/snapshot-restore/#security-considerations). Note that including the `opendistro_security` index in the snapshot may cause issues.

1. Verify whether the snapshot restore worked by requesting the status of the snapshot restore:

   ```txt
   GET /_snapshot/_status
   ```
