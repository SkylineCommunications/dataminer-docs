# Configuring an indexing database

To complete the configuration of a dedicated clustered storage setup, when a Cassandra-compatible database service has been set up, you need to set up an indexing database:

- [Elasticsearch](xref:Elasticsearch_database): Supported from DataMiner 9.6.4 onwards.

- [Amazon OpenSearch Service](xref:Amazon_OpenSearch_Service): Supported from DataMiner 10.3.0/10.3.3 onwards.

- [OpenSearch database](xref:OpenSearch_database): Supported from DataMiner 10.3.0/10.3.3 onwards.

An indexing database can also be [deployed in a setup with storage per DMA](xref:Configuring_indexing_database_per_DMS) to unlock additional DataMiner features, including:

- DataMiner Advanced Analytics features such as pattern matching
