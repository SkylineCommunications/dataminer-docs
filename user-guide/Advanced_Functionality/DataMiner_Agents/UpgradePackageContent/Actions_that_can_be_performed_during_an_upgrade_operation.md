# Actions that can be performed during an upgrade operation

In the *UpdateContent.txt* file, you can define a list of actions that have to be performed during an upgrade operation.

In addition, there can also be a file named *StartUpActions.txt* contained in the upgrade package, which can contain similar commands. In that case, *UpdateContent.txt* must contain an “Update Upgrades” command to unpack the *StartUpActions.txt* file to the correct Skyline DataMiner directory.

#### UpdateContent.txt

##### Action overview

- **SLEEP \[x\]**: Sleep for x seconds:

    ```txt
    SLEEP 1
    ```

- **Lock**: Lock the service manager.

- **Unlock**: Unlock the service manager.

- **Disable**: Disable and stop the DataMiner services (except SLWatchdog).

- **Enable**: Enable the DataMiner services. Also set the “Automatic startup” flags and descriptions.

- **Update \[x\]**: Replace the files in subfolder “x” of *C:\\Skyline DataMiner* by the files found the corresponding folder “x” of Update.zip:

    To replace the files in *C:\\Skyline DataMiner* (i.e. the root folder), use:

    ```txt
    Update Root
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to update a file in the *Files* or the *Tools* folder, first try to delete the file. If you get a “file in use” error, then add “*.SLReplace*” to the file name and schedule SLReplace to run at the end of the upgrade operation.

#### StartUpActions.txt

##### Action overview

- **Sync “filepath”**: Use this command to synchronize a file across the entire DMS cluster. This includes new DMAs that may be created in the future. This option is ideal for assemblies (WFM) and for Visio files, as it automatically invalidates the client cache.

- **UploadDataMinerProtocol “filepath”**: Use this command to embed .dmprotocol files in the upgrade package and upload and process them during DataMiner startup. Make sure that the specified file path is accessible for DataMiner, as otherwise the action cannot be performed.

- **SetAsProduction “\[ProtocolName\]\[ProtocolVersion\]”**: Use this command to set the particular protocol version as production version.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When a protocol linked to WFM assemblies is set to production, those assemblies are also copied to the production folder and synchronized throughout the DataMiner System.

- **StartElement “\[ElementName\]”**: Use this command to automatically start an element after the upgrade.

##### Example of a StartUpActions.txt file

```txt
Sync "C:\Skyline DataMiner\Protocols\Visio_files\New_vdx.zip"
Sync "C:\Skyline DataMiner\Protocols\WFMConcept\1.0.0.0\TestAssembly.dll"
SetAsProduction "WFMConcept\1.0.0.0"
UploadDataMinerProtocol "C:\Skyline DataMiner\Protocols\Concept - Assemblies_1.0.0.0.dmprotocol"
```
