# DataMiner Probes

A DMP or a DataMiner Probe is comparable to a limited DataMiner Agent.
DataMiner Probes enable operators to bring the power and intelligence of DataMiner to the most remote, isolated and/or unmanned locations, and to embed intelligent self-sustaining network management pockets within the operation. 
As a loosely coupled intermediate gateway, it guarantees the continuity you require for fault management, performance management and procedure automation (e.g. redundancy switching, automatic configuration for scheduled services and bookings, etc.).

DMPs are typically installed for example in remote VSAT terminals, satellite hubs, terrestrial transmitter sites, small network nodes, cellular network base centers, etc.

## Limitations of DMPs, compared to regular DMAs:
### Capacity
Probes only support up to 50 devices.

### Users
You can add as many users as you want to a DMP, but it can only be accessed by 1 user at a time.

### Ecosystem
Multiple DMAs can be clustered forming a DMS. However a DMP is not part of the DMS, it functions as a standalone gateway or proxy between its devices and the DMS.
This means that a probe needs to be upgraded separatedly from the cluster.

### View structure
A probe only has 1 single view with optional Visual Overview. All connected devices will be displayed within this view.

### Historical data
The probe can only store up to 7 days of historical data. However this data is typically forwarded towards the cluster, where it is stored longer.
