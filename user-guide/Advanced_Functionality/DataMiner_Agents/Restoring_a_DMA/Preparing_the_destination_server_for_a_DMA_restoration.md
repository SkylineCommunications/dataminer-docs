# Preparing the destination server for a DMA restoration

Regardless of whether you are restoring the backup to the DMA it was taken from or to a different DMA, you must make sure that the server is clean and ready for the installation.

To prepare the destination server, there are several possibilities:

- Install a blank, fully functional DataMiner Agent, as described in the DataMiner Installation Guide.

- Create a virtual machine using the [pre-installed DataMiner Virtual Hard Disk](xref:Using_a_pre_installed_DataMiner_Virtual_Hard_Disk).

- Clear the configuration of an existing DMA using the [Factory reset tool](xref:Factory_reset_tool). This is highly recommended over manually clearing the configuration.

- Manually clear the configuration of an existing DMA:

  1. If necessary, take a backup of the existing configuration.

  1. Go to the folder *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Tools* and run the *DataMiner Stop DataMiner And SLNet.bat* file. This will stop the DataMiner software.

  1. From the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Backup* directory, delete all content EXCEPT *TakeBackup.exe*, *BackupSettings.xml* and all *.dll* files. If necessary, copy existing backups to another location before deleting them.

  1. From the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Webpages\\Pictures* directory, delete all content EXCEPT the four files of which the name starts with *DMSPicViewer*.

  1. From the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\Webpages\\Reports\\templates* directory, delete all report templates. In other words, delete all content EXCEPT the *Template.inc.asp* file and the *styles* subdirectory.

  1. From the *C:\\ProgramData\\Skyline Communications\\DxMs Shared\\Data* and *C:\\ProgramData\\Skyline Communications\\DataMiner Orchestrator\\Data* directory, delete the *NodeId.txt* file, if present.

  1. Delete all content from the following directories:

     - Skyline DataMiner\\Correlation

     - Skyline DataMiner\\Documents

     - Skyline DataMiner\\Elements

     - Skyline DataMiner\\Logging

     - Skyline DataMiner\\Protocols

     - Skyline DataMiner\\Recycle Bin

     - Skyline DataMiner\\Redundancy

     - Skyline DataMiner\\Scripts

     - Skyline DataMiner\\Services

     - Skyline DataMiner\\Spectrum Alarm Recordings

     - Skyline DataMiner\\System Cache

     - Skyline DataMiner\\Users

     - Skyline DataMiner\\Views

     - Skyline DataMiner\\Webpages\\Annotations\\DMS Images

     - Skyline DataMiner\\Webpages\\Annotations\\Elements

     - Skyline DataMiner\\Webpages\\Annotations\\Views

     - Skyline DataMiner\\Webpages\\Dashboards\\db

  1. For a DMA using a Cassandra database:

     1. Open DevCenter, by going to *C:\\Program Files\\Cassandra\\DevCenter\\Run DevCenter.lnk*.

     1. In the *Connections* pane, click the icon to create a new connection.

     1. In the *New Connection* window, insert the Agent IP in the *Contact hosts* box and click *Add*.

     1. Click *Next* to go to the next step of the wizard.

     1. In both the *Login* and the *Password* box, insert *root*, and then click *Finish*.

     1. In the *Schema* pane of DevCenter, right-click *SLDMADB* and select *Drop Keyspace*.

     1. Open Windows Task Manager and stop the Cassandra service.

     1. Delete the content of the folder *D:\\ProgramData\\Cassandra\\SLDMADB*.

     Alternatively, for a DMA using a legacy MySQL database:

     1. Open the MySQL command prompt, and enter the following SQL statement:

        ```txt
        drop schema SLDMADB;
        ```

     1. Stop the MySQL service.

     1. Delete all content from the SLDMADB directory. Depending on the MySQL version, this will be:

        - *C:\\MySQL\\Data\\SLDMADB*, or

        - *C:\\Program Files\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 5.0\\data\\SLDMADB*

  1. For a DMA using a local Elasticsearch database:

      1. Open Windows Task Manager and stop the Elasticsearch service.

      1. Delete the content of the folder *D:\\ProgramData\\ElasticSearch\\*.

  1. For a DMA using a local OpenSearch database:

      1. Connect to the server using the user credentials that were used to configure OpenSearch.

      1. Stop OpenSearch by going to the Command Prompt or Powershell window that is running OpenSearch and either entering CTRL+C or closing the window.

      1. Open the *opensearch.yaml* file and look for *path.data*.

      1. Delete the content of the folder specified with *path.data*.

         If no path.data folder is configured in the YAML file, you will instead need to remove the content of the folder *C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\OpenSearch* of the user that was running the OpenSearch database.

  1. Delete the Windows user accounts on the server that have a corresponding DataMiner account.

  1. In the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner* folder, replace the content of the file *Views.xml* with the following content:

     ```xml
     <Views xmlns="http://www.skyline.be/config/views"/>
     ```

  1. In the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner* folder, clear the content of the *Security.xml* file. In addition, we recommend that you also remove the DataMiner users in Windows (by running compmgmt.msc), as DataMiner will not remove them.

  1. Remove the file *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\files\\SyncInfo\\{DO_NOT_REMOVE_68EE4388-7EF6-4cb4-B38F-5E0045175340}.xml*.

  1. Start DataMiner. During startup, the necessary database tables will be created.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The destination DataMiner Agent must run exactly the same DataMiner software version as the original server. If it does not, perform either a software upgrade or a software downgrade to make sure the version is the same.
> - The destination server must have enough resources (CPU, memory, hard disk performance, etc.) to be able to handle the DataMiner configuration that you intend to restore on that server.
> - If you intend to migrate to another server while the original DMA stays online, take care to avoid an IP conflict:
>   - Either keep the destination server offline as long as the original DMA is online, or
>   - Make sure that the destination server has a different IP address and computer name.
> - For the DxMs running on the server, no changes are needed.
