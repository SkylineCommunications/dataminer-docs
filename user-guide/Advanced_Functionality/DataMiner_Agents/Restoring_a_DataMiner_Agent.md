# Restoring a DataMiner Agent

Restoring a DataMiner Agent can be done with the Taskbar Utility, or manually, depending on the way the backup was taken. If the DMA is not restored using the Taskbar Utility, the database and configuration need to be restored separately.

You can restore a DMA either on the same hardware, or on new hardware.

The following procedures are described in this section:

- [Preparing the destination server for a DMA restoration](xref:Preparing_the_destination_server_for_a_DMA_restoration)

- [Restoring a DMA using the DataMiner Taskbar Utility](xref:Restoring_a_DMA_using_the_DataMiner_Taskbar_Utility)

- [Restoring the DMA configuration only](xref:Restoring_the_DMA_configuration_only)

- [Restoring the database only](xref:Restoring_the_database_only)

- [Starting a restored DataMiner Agent in a cluster](xref:Starting_a_restored_DataMiner_Agent_in_a_cluster)
