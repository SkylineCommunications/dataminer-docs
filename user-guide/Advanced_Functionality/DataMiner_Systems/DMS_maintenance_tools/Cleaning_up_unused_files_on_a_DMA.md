In System Center, you can clean up unused protocols, unused alarm filters and unused Visio files.

To do so:

1. In Cube, go to *Apps* > *System Center.*

2. In the *System Center* module, select the *Tools* page.

3. In the second column, select *Clean up unused*.

4. Depending on the type of file you want to clean up, do the following:

    - To clean up unused protocols:

        1. At the bottom of the *Protocols* tab, click the *Load* button.

            A list with the unused protocols in the DMS will be loaded.

        2. Select the protocols you want to delete and click the *Delete* button.

    - To clean up unused alarm filters:

        1. At the bottom of the *Alarm filters* tab, click the *Load* button.

            A list with the unused alarm filters in the DMS will be loaded.

        2. Select the alarm filters you want to delete and click the *Delete* button.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The scan for unused alarm filters does not include the usage of alarm filters in the Alarm Console, in DMS dashboards or for alarm blinking. To be sure alarm filters are not used in these applications, a manual check is required.

    - To clean up unused Visio files:

        1. At the bottom of the *Visio files* tab, click the *Load* button.

            A list with the unused Visio files in the DMS will be loaded.

        2. Select the files you want to delete and click the *Delete* button.
