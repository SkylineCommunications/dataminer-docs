1. On the DMA you intend to add to the cluster, go to the *System Center* module and select the *Agents* page.

2. On the *Manage* tab, select the DataMiner Agent to which you are connected.

3. In the pane on the right, next to *Cluster*, enter the name of the DMS, and then click *Add Cluster* (prior to DataMiner 10.0.13) or *Join cluster* (from DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards).

4. On a DMA that is currently already in the cluster, go to the *System Center* module and select the *Agents* page.

5. In the *Manage* tab, below the list of DMAs in the cluster, click *Add*.

6. Enter the IP of the DMA you want to add and click *Add*.

> [!NOTE]
> To add a Failover pair to a DataMiner System, first add the primary DMA as a regular DataMiner Agent, and then configure Failover. See [Preparing the two DataMiner Agents](xref:Preparing_the_two_DataMiner_Agents).
