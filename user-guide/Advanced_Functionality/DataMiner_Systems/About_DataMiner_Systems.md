# About DataMiner Systems

A DataMiner System (DMS) is a collection of two or more DataMiner Agents interconnected via a TCP/IP network. This is also called a "DataMiner cluster". The purpose of a DMS is to make the system appear as a single entity to the user and to minimize repetitive tasks. In DataMiner Cube, you are able to [view information on all individual DMAs](xref:Viewing_information_on_the_DMAs_in_a_DMS) you have [added to your DMS](xref:Adding_a_DataMiner_Agent_to_a_DataMiner_System).

When you [set up a new DMS](xref:Before_you_begin_to_set_up_a_new_DMS), you will need to make sure the necessary [databases](xref:Databases_about
) are set up as well.
