# User groups

DataMiner users are part of one or more groups. Groups can be granted rights according to three concepts: permissions, views and access levels. Users in those groups simply inherit the rights granted to the groups of which they are a member. User settings can also be configured at group level.

There are two types of groups:

- **Local groups**: Proprietary user groups, created and managed in DataMiner.

- **Domain groups**: User groups available in the Windows domain, managed by the domain administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> Optionally, a user who is a member of a group can be granted a personal access level. That level will then override the access level granted to the group.
