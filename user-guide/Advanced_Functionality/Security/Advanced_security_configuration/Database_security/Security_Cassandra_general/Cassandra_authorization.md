# Cassandra authorization

## Enabling the CassandraAuthorizer

Implementing a Zero Trust architecture requires applying the principle of least privilege across your infrastructure. This is especially true for your databases. By default, DataMiner installs Cassandra with authorizer **AllowAllAuthorizer**, effectively granting all permissions to all roles. However, Cassandra also supports the **CassandraAuthorizer**, which allows more granular permission management.

To enable the *CassandraAuthorizer* in Cassandra:

1. Set the *authorizer* field to *CassandraAuthorizer* in your *cassandra.yaml* file (located in the Cassandra installation folder):

   `authorizer: CassandraAuthorizer`

1. Now **restart** the Cassandra service to enable the *CassandraAuthorizer*.

1. Grant your DataMiner database user full permissions on the DataMiner keyspaces. You can do so by executing the following queries (using DevCenter, the DataMiner Cube Query Executor, or your preferred query tool):

   `GRANT CREATE ON ALL KEYSPACES TO <YOUR DATABASE USER/ROLE>;`

   `GRANT ALL ON KEYSPACE "SLDMADB" TO <YOUR DATABASE USER/ROLE>;`

   `GRANT ALL ON KEYSPACE "sldmadb_ticketing" TO <YOUR DATABASE USER/ROLE>;`

> [!NOTE]
> For Cassandra clusters, DataMiner requires **full permissions** on all keyspaces.
