# DataMiner user permissions

In the System Center module, the user permissions have been divided into two main groups: *General* and *Modules*. Below is an overview of the different permissions.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - To quickly find a particular user permission in System Center, use the filter box in the top-right corner of the list of permissions.
> - Some of these user permissions are only available if the DMA has the correct licenses and configuration, so that the user permissions are relevant.
> - For many permissions, it makes no sense to grant them unless you grant the corresponding *UI Available* permission as well.
