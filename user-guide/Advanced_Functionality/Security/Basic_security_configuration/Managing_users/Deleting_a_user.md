# Deleting a user

[Local users](xref:Types_of_users#local-users) and [manually added domain users](xref:Types_of_users#manually-added-domain-users) can be deleted on the *Users / Groups* page in System Center:

1. In the *Users / Groups* section of the System Center module, go to the *users* tab.

1. Right-click the user in the *Local* or *Domain* list and select *Delete*.

1. In the confirmation window, click *OK*.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to delete an [automatically added domain user](xref:Types_of_users#automatically-added-domain-users), you will need to remove it from the domain group outside of DataMiner.
