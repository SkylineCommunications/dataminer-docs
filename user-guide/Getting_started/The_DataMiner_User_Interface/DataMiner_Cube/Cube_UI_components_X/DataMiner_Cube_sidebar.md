# DataMiner Cube sidebar

From DataMiner 10.0.0/10.0.2 onwards, on the left-hand side of the Cube UI, a sidebar is displayed. This sidebar contains the following buttons:

- *Surveyor*: Opens the Surveyor pane. See [Surveyor pane](#surveyor-pane).

- *Activity*: Opens a pane listing recent items. See [Activity pane](#activity-pane).

- *Apps*: Opens a pane listing the different apps available in Cube. See [Apps pane](#apps-pane).

- *Workspaces*: Opens a pane where you can select and manage different Cube workspaces. See [Working with workspaces](xref:Working_with_workspaces).

- *Community*: This button is displayed from DataMiner 10.0.0 \[CU12\]/10.1.0 \[CU1\]/10.1.4 onwards. Clicking the button opens a menu with different links to the [DataMiner Dojo user community](https://community.dataminer.services/), including the blog, the learning hub, a library of resources, a page where you can ask questions about anything related to DataMiner, and a page that allows you to suggest new features.

From DataMiner 10.1.11/10.2.0 onwards, you can pin additional buttons to the sidebar using the “...” or “+” button. This button opens a menu where you can select the buttons you want to pin.

- *Overview*: Displays the root view page listing all items below the root view.

- *Search*: If an advanced search is done from the Cube header bar, an additional *Search* button is displayed, which displays the pane with the advanced search results. If this button is not pinned to the sidebar, it will no longer be displayed as soon as you click a different button. See [Searching in DataMiner Cube](xref:Searching_in_DataMiner_Cube).

- A button representing any of the available modules, the “About” information, the Help, or the settings.

To unpin a button again, right-click the button and select *Unpin*. This is not possible for the buttons that are displayed by default.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - At most 4 items can be pinned to the sidebar. If the maximum number of items has been added, the button to pin more items is no longer displayed, until an item is unpinned again.
> - It is possible to move the position of the sidebar to the right-hand side. To do so, press *Ctrl+Alt+Shift+RightArrow*. To move the pane back to the left-hand side, press *Ctrl+Alt+Shift+LeftArrow*. The sidebar position can also be changed in the Cube settings. See [Cube settings](xref:User_settings#cube-settings).

## Surveyor pane

The Surveyor pane contains a hierarchical overview of all views, elements, services, etc. in your DataMiner System. It features alarm bubble-up, state indication, etc.

When you click an item in the tree, it opens in a card:

- If you click the item with the left mouse button, the new card replaces a card that is already open.

- If you click the item with the middle mouse button, the new card is opened next to any cards that are already open.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - For the right-click menu options in the Surveyor, see [Surveyor right-click menu](xref:Main_Cube_UI_components_prior_to_DataMiner_10#surveyor-right-click-menu).
> - You can drag an element, service, view, or SLA from a card or from the Surveyor to another application, such as Microsoft Word or Outlook, to copy information about that DataMiner item to the application in question.

### Icons

The icons that precede an item name in the tree show what kind of item it is and what state and alarm state it is in.

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the user settings, the legacy icons may be displayed instead of the icons described below. For more information on the legacy icons, see [Icons](xref:Main_Cube_UI_components_prior_to_DataMiner_10#icons).

- There are specific icons for different types of items:

  | Icon | Item description |
  |------|------------------|
  | ![View icon](~/user-guide/images/CubeXView.png) | View |
  | ![Element icon](~/user-guide/images/CubeXElement.png) | Element or default function DVE (prior to DataMiner 10.0.5 - requires DataMiner Service & Resource Management) |
  | ![Service icon](~/user-guide/images/CubeXService.png) | Service |
  | ![Service template icon](~/user-guide/images/CubeXServiceTemplate.png) | Service template |
  | ![Redundancy group icon](~/user-guide/images/CubeXRedunGroup.png) | Redundancy group |
  | ![SLA icon](~/user-guide/images/CubeXSLA.png) | SLA |
  | ![Protocol icon](~/user-guide/images/CubeXProtocol.png) | Protocol |
  | ![Parameter icon](~/user-guide/images/CubeXParameter.png) | Parameter |
  | ![Script icon](~/user-guide/images/CubeXScript.png) | Script |
  | ![Setting icon](~/user-guide/images/CubeXSetting.png) | Setting |
  | ![Function icon](~/user-guide/images/CubeXFunction.png) | Default function DVE (from DataMiner 10.0.5 onwards – requires DataMiner Service & Resource Management) |

- View icons are filled with a different color, depending on their alarm state. On other icons, a colored circle is displayed when they are in a particular alarm state. In addition to the default colors indicating the alarm severity, the circle can also be displayed in purple to indicate that an item is masked.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The alarm state color is determined by the most severe of all the current alarms for the item.

  > [!TIP]
  > See also:
  >
  > - [Alarm severity levels](xref:Alarm_types#alarm-severity-levels)
  > - [Changing the default alarm colors](xref:Changing_the_default_alarm_colors)

- There may be additional symbols on an icon to indicate a particular state:

  | Symbol  | Description   |
  |---------|---------------|
  | Gray square | Located in the corner of an icon to indicate that the item is stopped. |
  | Two vertical bars | Located in the corner of an icon to indicate that polling on the item is paused. |
  | Orange X | Indicates that an element in a view or service is in timeout state. |
  | White X on red background | Indicates that an element is in error state. |
  | Upwards arrow | Displayed next to a service child in case the capped severity of the service child is lower than the actual severity. The icon has the color of the severity that will bubble up to the parent service. |
  | Circle containing a horizontal line, for example: ![Unavailable element icon](~/user-guide/images/element_unavailable.png) | Indicates that the DMA hosting the item is currently unavailable. Though the information on the item is still available in the cache, it is not possible to execute any actions on the item. This icon is used from DataMiner 10.0.12 onwards. In this DataMiner version, it is only used for elements, and other items are not displayed when the DMA hosting them is unavailable. From DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards, it is also used for services and redundancy groups. |
