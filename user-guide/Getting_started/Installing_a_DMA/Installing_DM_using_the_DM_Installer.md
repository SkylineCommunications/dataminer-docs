# Installing DataMiner using the DataMiner Installer

> [!TIP]
> Not familiar with DataMiner? See [Basic concepts](xref:BasicConcepts).

The DataMiner installer allows you to run a default DataMiner installation, which includes a Cassandra database on the C drive, or to run a custom installation.

> [!NOTE]
> The DataMiner software can only be installed on the C: drive. It is currently not possible to select another drive for the installation of DataMiner.

## Before you run the installer

1. Make sure the necessary .NET and .NET Framework versions are installed. See [DataMiner Compute Requirements](xref:DataMiner_Compute_Requirements).

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > - For information on how to determine which versions you have installed. See <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed>.
   > - For installation information, see [Installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/).

1. Make sure the Windows setting "fast startup" is not activated.

1. Make sure the server is synced with an NTP server. If you intend to install multiple DataMiner Agents in a cluster, make sure all servers are synced with the same NTP server.

1. Make sure that no anti-virus software will interfere with the DataMiner installer and with the DataMiner software once it is installed. See [Regarding antivirus software](xref:Regarding_antivirus_software).

1. Download the DataMiner installer from [DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/download/dataminer-installer-v10-2).

> [!NOTE]
> The default installation requires that WinPCap or [NPCap](https://nmap.org/npcap/) is installed for systems intended for DataMiner Failover based on virtual IP. If you intend to configure a [Failover setup based on hostname](xref:Failover_configuration_in_Cube), this software will not be needed. WinPCap can be installed with a custom installation using the DataMiner 10.0 installer; however, note that WinPCap is considered obsolete since 2018. For now, NPCap is not included in the DataMiner Installer.

### Default DataMiner installation

1. Make sure you are logged into Windows with the correct user account:

   - If you are using the DataMiner 10.2 installer or newer, use an account with administrator rights. During the installation, the user account will automatically be added to a local DataMiner user group named *Administrator (installer)*. 
   - If you are using a DataMiner installer older than version 10.2, use the server's local Administrator account. Do not use a regular user account with administrative rights.

1. Double-click the setup executable.

1. Click *Install*.

1. Enter the DataMiner ID.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > To get this DataMiner ID, contact <dataminer.licensing@skyline.be>. The DataMiner ID will uniquely identify the DataMiner Agent you are installing.
   >
   > If you are a Skyline employee, use the procedure from the [Skyline internal documentation](https://internaldocs.skyline.be/Corporate/OperatingProcedures/OP_RequestDecommissionMaintainInternalServer/Requesting_a_DMA_ID_or_a_DataMiner_license_for_an_internal_DataMiner_Agent.html) instead.

1. Click next.

   The progress of the installation will be displayed. A *cancel* button in the lower right corner allows you to cancel the installation process if necessary.

1. Once the installation is complete, click *next*.

1. Click *go to Request.lic* to browse to *Request.lic*.

1. Send the *Request.lic* file to <dataminer.licensing@skyline.be>, and wait until you receive the reply.

   > [!TIP]
   > See also: [Obtaining a DataMiner license](xref:DataminerLicenses)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you are a Skyline employee, use the procedure from the [Skyline internal documentation](https://internaldocs.skyline.be/Corporate/OperatingProcedures/OP_RequestDecommissionMaintainInternalServer/Requesting_a_DMA_ID_or_a_DataMiner_license_for_an_internal_DataMiner_Agent.html) instead.

1. Once you have received the license files, save these somewhere on the computer; however, not in the "Skyline DataMiner" folder.

1. In the *License* tab of the DataMiner Installer, click *browse and upload*, and navigate to the license files.

1. Once all files have been uploaded successfully, click *restart DataMiner*.

1. When DataMiner has successfully restarted, click *Close*.

At this point, the basic installation is complete. However, to be able to make full use of all available DataMiner features, you will also need to:

- [Upgrade to the latest feature or main release version](xref:Upgrading_a_DataMiner_Agent)
- [Connect your DataMiner System to dataminer.services](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud)
- Either deploy [Storage as a Service](xref:STaaS) to make use of cloud-native storage hosted by Skyline or, if you wish to host the DataMiner storage yourself, [configure the databases](xref:Configuring_dedicated_clustered_storage).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During the DataMiner installation, you are automatically added to the Administrator group by the installation wizard, giving you all Administrator rights. To grant others access to your DMA, log in to Cube using the same username and password as during the installation process, and configure user permissions as described in [Basic security configuration](xref:Managing_users).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - To view detailed log information on the installation process, in the last step of the installer, click the *open log files* button.
> - If you closed the DataMiner installer before uploading the license files, copy the license files to the *C:\Skyline DataMiner* folder and restart DataMiner.

### Custom DataMiner installation

1. Make sure you are logged into Windows as a user account with administrative rights.

1. Double-click the setup executable.

1. Click *Customize*.

1. Enter the DataMiner ID.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > To get this DataMiner ID, you must contact Skyline. The DataMiner ID will uniquely identify the DataMiner Agent you are installing.

1. Customize the installation to match the setup you want:

   - Ideally Cassandra should be installed on a different drive than the C drive. To specify the drive, click *select data drive*, select the drive, and click *OK*.

     > [!NOTE]
     > By default, a DataMiner Agent uses a single Cassandra node that is hosted on the same physical or virtual server. However, different architectures are also possible. For more information, see [Supported system data storage architectures](xref:Supported_system_data_storage_architectures), or check with your Technical Account Manager.

   - If you are using an older DataMiner installer, you can select to install *MySQL Server*, and optionally [*MySQL Workbench*](xref:MySQL_Workbench). However, as MySQL support is **End of Life** as of DataMiner version 10.4.X (Q4 2023), this option is **not recommended**.

     > [!NOTE]
     >
     > - MySQL is no longer included in the 10.2.0 DataMiner installer.
     > - If a MySQL database is used, certain DataMiner features (e.g. trend predictions, ticketing, jobs, service & resource manager) will **not be available**.

   - If you are using the DataMiner 10.0 installer, on systems intended for DataMiner Failover, install WinPcap by clicking *Install WinPcap*. The Setup Wizard of WinPcap will be launched. Follow the wizard, select *Automatically start the WinPcap driver at boot time*, and click *Next* when necessary.

     > [!NOTE]
     > The DataMiner 10.2 installer no longer supports WinPCap. If you intend to configure a [Failover setup based on hostname](xref:Failover_configuration_in_Cube), this software will not be needed. However, if you intend to configure a [Failover setup based on virtual IP](xref:Failover_configuration_in_Cube), you will need to install [NPCap](https://nmap.org/npcap/) instead.

   - If the built-in Administrator account is not enabled, select *Create administrator account for current user* to create a Windows user account.

1. Click *Next*.

   The progress of the installation will be displayed. A *cancel* button in the lower right corner allows you to cancel the installation process if necessary.

1. Once the installation is complete, click *next*.

1. Click *go to Request.lic* to browse to *Request.lic*.

1. Send the *Request.lic* file to <dataminer.licensing@skyline.be>, and wait until you receive the reply.

1. Once you have received the license files, save these somewhere on the computer; however, not in the "Skyline DataMiner" folder.

1. In the *License* tab of the DataMiner Installer, click *browse and upload*, and navigate to the license files.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you closed the DataMiner installer before uploading the license files, copy the license files to the *C:\Skyline DataMiner* folder and restart DataMiner.

1. Once all files have been uploaded successfully, click *restart DataMiner*.

1. When DataMiner has successfully restarted, click *Close*.

- [Connect your DataMiner System to dataminer.services](xref:Connecting_your_DataMiner_System_to_the_cloud)
- Either deploy [Storage as a Service](xref:STaaS) to make use of storage nodes that are fully hosted by Skyline or, if you wish to host the storage nodes yourself, [configure the databases](xref:Configuring_dedicated_clustered_storage).
