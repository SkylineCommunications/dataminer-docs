# Creating a DataMiner System

To create a DataMiner System (DMS), there are different possibilities:

- You can make use of **DataMiner as a Service (DaaS)**. This means that you [create your DMS in the cloud](xref:Creating_a_DMS_in_the_cloud) in just a few clicks, and it will be fully hosted and maintained by Skyline Communications.

- You can host the DataMiner nodes yourself. For **self-hosted DataMiner nodes**, you will need to [install the DataMiner Agents](xref:Installing_a_DataMiner_Agent) and then set up your DataMiner System yourself. For the data storage for these nodes, two options are available:

  - You can make use of [Storage as a Service (STaaS)](xref:STaaS). You connect your DataMiner System to a scalable, easy-to-use, cloud-native storage platform hosted by Skyline.

  - You can host the storage nodes yourself. This means you will need to take care of [configuring and maintaining the databases](xref:Configuring_dedicated_clustered_storage).
