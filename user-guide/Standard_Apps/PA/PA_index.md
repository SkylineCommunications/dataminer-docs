# Process Automation framework

This section contains information related to setting up and working with Process Automation (PA). This includes information on the product, architecture, development, and deployment.

> [!NOTE]
> All information in this section applies to PA version 2. Obsolete features from PA version 1 are not included. While processes that were running with the initial PA version should still run with version 2, they use an architecture that is no longer promoted, and they will not allow the use of the latest PA features.
