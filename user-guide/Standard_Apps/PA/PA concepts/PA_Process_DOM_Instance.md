# Process DOM instance

A process DataMiner Object Model (DOM) instance can be used as a container of data available during the execution of a process. Each activity can grab data from the process DOM instance and update fields in this container. This results in an easy way to exchange data between activities.

Fields from the process DOM instance can also be used as decision criteria for the [gateways](xref:PA_Process_Definition#gateway).
