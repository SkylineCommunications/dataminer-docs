# Logging

When the Booking Manager is configured to store log files in a shared folder, Process Automation will generate one log file per main token pushed into a process.

For more information on the Booking Manager, see [Booking Manager user interface](xref:Booking_Manager_user_interface).

> [!NOTE]
> The default name of the Booking Manager element used by Process Automation is "Process Automation Instances".
