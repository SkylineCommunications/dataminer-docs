# Creating user tasks

Create a user [DOM definition](xref:DomDefinition) with the *pa_user_task* ModuleID and using the *PA User Task* behavior definition.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Process Automation gets delivered with a default user DOM definition.
> - At present, there is no user interface or dedicated development environment available to create DOM definitions. Contact Skyline Communications if you want more information on how to create DOM definitions.
> - Typically, a user task app will be made available so that the end user can access these user tasks and complete them.
