# DataMiner EPM Solution

The DataMiner EPM Solution is designed to manage very high volumes of devices in cable, telecom, terrestrial, and satellite environments. The solution enables operators to collect valuable operational data from every relevant object in their ecosystem and to optimize the service quality and availability.

At present, two different versions of the solution are available:

- [DataMiner EPM I-DOCSIS](xref:EPM_I-DOCSIS)
- [DataMiner EPM D-DOCSIS](xref:EPM_D-DOCSIS)
