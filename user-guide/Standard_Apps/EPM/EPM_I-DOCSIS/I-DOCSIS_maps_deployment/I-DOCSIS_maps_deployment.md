# EPM I-DOCSIS maps deployment

There are two different ways to deploy the I-DOCSIS EPM maps to a DataMiner System, depending on the number of elements using the [Skyline EPM Platform DOCSIS](https://catalog.dataminer.services/result/driver/7209) protocol:

- If the DataMiner System only contains one element using this protocol, use the procedure for [systems with one back-end element](xref:I-DOCSIS_maps_deployment_one_backend).

- If the DataMiner System contains multiple elements using this protocol, use the procedure for [systems with multiple back-end elements](xref:I-DOCSIS_maps_deployment_multiple_backends).
