- **US QAM Ch PreMTTER Alarm Status**: Calculated. Only available for DOCSIS 3.x. The PreMTTER alarm status. Possible values: *OOS* and *OK*.

  This alarm is based on the PreMTTER value being above or below the PreMTTER threshold. If the value is above the threshold, the alarm value is *OOS*, otherwise it is *OK*.

  This alarm is based on the PostMTTER value being above or below the PostMTTER threshold. If the value is above the threshold, the alarm value is *OOS*, otherwise it is *OK*.

- **Reflection Power Ratio**: Direct value.

- **US QAM Ch MTC**: Calculated. Only available for DOCSIS 3.x. The MTC value of a channel.

  Calculated as follows: MTC = (Main Tap + Pre-Main Tap + Post-Main Tap) / Main Tap. All values in this formula are contained in pre-equalization data (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.4491.2.1.20.1.2.1.6).

  This problem type is obtained depending on several conditions:

  - If the NMTER value is lower than the NMTER threshold, the problem type is *No Problem*.
  - If (PreMTTER - PostMTTER) > 0, the problem type is *Group Delay*.
  - If the PostMTTER value is higher than or equal to the PostMTTER threshold, the problem type is *Micro-Reflection*.
  - If both of the conditions above apply, the problem type is *Group Delay and Micro-Reflection*.
