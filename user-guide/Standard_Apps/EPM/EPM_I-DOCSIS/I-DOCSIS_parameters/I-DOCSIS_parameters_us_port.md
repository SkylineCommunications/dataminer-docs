# I-DOCSIS parameters â€“ US Port

This page contains an overview of the US Port parameters available in the I-DOCSIS branch of the EPM Solution.

## KPIs & KQIs

- **Number CM**: Calculated. The number of CMs served by the US port.

  Calculated by aggregating the number of CMs associated with the US port.

- **Number CM Offline**: Calculated. The number of offline CMs associated with the US port, from the CCAP perspective.

  Calculated by aggregating the number of CMs reported as offline by the CCAP (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.4491.2.1.20.1.3.1.6) (1 Other = Offline, 8 Operational = Online, any other value = Initializing).

- **Percentage CM Offline**: Calculated. The percentage of offline CMs associated with the US port, from the CCAP perspective.

  Calculated based on the CMs reported as offline by the CCAP (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.4491.2.1.20.1.3.1.6) (1 Other = Offline, 8 Operational = Online, any other value = Initializing).

- **Number CM DOCSIS 2.0**

- **Number CM DOCSIS 3.0**

- **Number CM DOCSIS 3.1**

- **Number CM DOCSIS 1.x**: Calculated. The number of cable modems associated with the node segment that report their DOCSIS version as a version within the 1.x range.

- **Number CM DOCSIS Other**: Calculated. The number of CMs associated with the given level that have an unknown DOCSIS version.

  Calculated by adding up the number of CMs with an unknown DOCSIS version that are served by the DS port.

- **Number CM Ping Unreachable**: Calculated. The number of CMs associated with the US port that are reporting the ping status "Unreachable".

  Calculated by aggregating the number of CMs with ping status "Unreachable".

- **Percentage CM Ping Unreachable**: Calculated. The percentage of CMs associated with the US port that are reporting the ping status "Unreachable".

- **Percentage Utilization**: Calculated. The average utilization of all US channels associated with the US port.

- **Average Latency**: Calculated. The average latency for all CMs associated with the given level. Only CMs that present valid values count towards this KPI.

- **Average Jitter**: Calculated. The average jitter for all CMs associated with the given level. Only CMs that present valid values count towards this KPI.

- **Average Packet Loss Rate**: Calculated. The average packet loss rate for all CMs associated with the given level. Only CMs that present valid values count towards this KPI.
