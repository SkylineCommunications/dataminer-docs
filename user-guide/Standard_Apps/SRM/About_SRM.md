# About DataMiner Service & Resource Management

DataMiner Service and Resource Management (SRM) is a versatile toolset that can be tailored to your orchestration and automation needs. Four different [SRM use cases](xref:srm_use_cases) are supported, which can flexibly be combined within or across workflows.

Before you get started with SRM, first take a look at the different [SRM framework concepts](xref:srm_concepts), and then follow our [getting started guide](xref:srm_getting_started).

If SRM is already fully deployed in your system, and you are looking how to easily interact with this module, the [Booking Manager app](xref:Booking_Manager_user_interface) is what you need.

There are a great many possibilities for fine-tuning the SRM deployment so that it fits exactly with your needs. Check out the [advanced configuration](xref:SRM_user_interface_customization) to find out more.

> Redundancy groups cannot be integrated with DataMiner Service and Resource Management (SRM).
