# Service Orchestration: service profiles configuration

With the Service Profile Wizard, users can create bookings based on service profiles. A service profile groups a service definition together with profile instances for each of its nodes. This allows users to create bookings more easily, as they will only need to select the service profile, and everything else will be configured in the background.

To be able to use this feature:

- Make sure the necessary [service profile definitions](xref:SRM_Services_profiles#configuring-service-profile-definitions) and [service profile instances](xref:SRM_Services_profiles#configuring-service-profile-instances) have been configured in the Services module.

- Make sure the Service Profile feature is enabled in the Booking Manager app (via [Config > Wizard > Service Profile](xref:Booking_Manager_Config_tab#type-of-wizard-settings)).
