# Creating a custom front end for the Booking Manager

The default Visual Overview used for the Booking Manager element shows the bookings on a [timeline component](xref:Embedding_a_Resource_Manager_component) and in a [list view component](xref:Creating_a_list_view).

While we do not recommend this, you can create your own customized Visual Overview as an alternative front end and assign it to the Booking Manager element. See [Set as active Visio file](xref:Editing_a_visual_overview_in_DataMiner_Cube#set-as-active-visio-file).

> [!CAUTION]
> Using a custom Visual Overview may lead to increased development and maintenance costs.
