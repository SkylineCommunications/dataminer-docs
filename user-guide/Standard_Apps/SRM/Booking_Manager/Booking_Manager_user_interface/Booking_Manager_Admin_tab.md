# The Admin tab

This tab of the Booking Manager app consists of the following subtabs:

- **Resources**: Displays the *Resources* component of the framework.

- **Profiles**: Displays the *Profiles* component of the framework.

- **Definitions**: Displays the *Services* component of the framework.

- **About**: Displays the version of the SRM Framework and details which files are currently in use. With the *Analyze* button in the lower right corner, you can run an analysis of the files making up the SRM Framework (scripts, protocols, Visio files and DLLs) and check if these all originate from the same package.
