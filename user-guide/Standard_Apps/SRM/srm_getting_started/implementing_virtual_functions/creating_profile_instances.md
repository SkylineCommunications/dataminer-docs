# Creating profile instances

While [profile instances](xref:srm_instantiations#profile-instance) can also be added later, we recommend that you already **create at least one profile instance for each virtual function** during setup, after profile parameters and profile definitions have been created.

You can do so in the [Profiles module](xref:Configuring_profile_instances).

For example, in DataMiner 10.2.0:
