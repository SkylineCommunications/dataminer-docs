# DataMiner PTP app

The DataMiner PTP app allows you to monitor a PTP stack in real time. It provides an overview of all PTP nodes and their roles, constantly monitors important PTP metrics and statistics of grandmaster clocks, boundary clocks and PTP slave devices, and allows you to identify any change in the PTP environment.

PTP (Precision Time Protocol) is the de facto protocol used by broadcasters, media network operators and service providers to synchronize device clocks in complex media networks to achieve accurately synchronized video, audio and meta-data streams.

> [!NOTE]
> The DataMiner PTP app requires DataMiner version 10.0.3 or above.
