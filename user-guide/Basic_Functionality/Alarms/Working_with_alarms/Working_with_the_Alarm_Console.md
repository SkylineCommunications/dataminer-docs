# Working with the Alarm Console

The Alarm Console is displayed at the bottom of the Cube workspace. It can contain various lists of alarms, such as the active alarms, masked alarms and information events. However, it is highly customizable, so you can adapt both what it displays and how this is displayed.

> [!NOTE]
> The Alarm Console is limited to never show more than 100,000 alarms. If there are more alarms in the DMS, they will no longer be forwarded to Cube.
