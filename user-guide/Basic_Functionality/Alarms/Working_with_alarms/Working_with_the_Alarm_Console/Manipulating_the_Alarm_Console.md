# Manipulating the Alarm Console

- To collapse the Alarm Console, click the downward arrow button in the top-right corner: ![Collapse Alarm Console button](~/user-guide/images/Collapse_Alarm_Console_button.png)

  Only the alarm bar will be displayed, which displays the total number of active alarms, the total number of unread alarms and the number of active alarms per severity in the currently selected alarm tab. In addition, the alarm bar also displays a number of buttons that can also be used in the expanded Alarm Console.

- To return the Alarm Console to its original size again, click the upward arrow button: ![Expand Alarm Console button](~/user-guide/images/Expand_Alarm_Console_button.png)

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can also single-click the alarm bar to temporarily open it on top of the open cards. As soon as you click anywhere else, the console will collapse again.

- To maximize the Alarm Console over the entire window, click the maximize button: ![Maximize button](~/user-guide/images/Maximize_button00039.png)

- To undock the Alarm Console into a separate window, click the undock button: ![Undock button](~/user-guide/images/Undock_button.png)

- To open a menu that displays any notifications related to alarms or suggested events, click the light bulb button: ![Light bulb button](~/user-guide/images/LightBulb_button.png) <!--RN 36777-->

- If the Alarm Console is undocked in a separate window, close that window to dock the Alarm Console to its original position at the bottom of the main DataMiner Cube window.

- To undock one tab of the Alarm Console, drag the tab header out of the Alarm Console.

- To dock an alarm tab page as a separate card in the workspace, first drag the tab header out of the Alarm Console, and then click *Dock to workspace* in the top right corner of the window.
