> [!TIP]
> See also: [Alarm Console – Adding columns to the Alarm Console](https://community.dataminer.services/video/alarm-console-adding-columns-to-the-alarm-console/) on DataMiner Dojo ![Video](~/user-guide/images/video_Duo.png)

Below, all columns available in the Alarm Console are listed. By default, not all columns are shown in Cube. The mentioned column names are the default column names; however, these names can be customized in Cube.

For more information on changing the column layout, see [Changing the column layout in an alarm tab](xref:ChangingTheAlarmConsoleLayout#changing-the-column-layout-in-an-alarm-tab).

- **Icon**: Shown by default. Alarm icon colored according to the alarm severity.

  - For new alarms, the icon is a single vertical line.

  - For correlated alarms and alarm groups, it is a vertical, dashed line.

  - For updated alarm records, a second, thinner vertical line is added next to the first.

- **Focus**: Available on systems using [STaaS](xref:STaaS) or a self-hosted Cassandra-compatible database. Shown by default. This column displays a focus icon if an alarm is unexpected. See [Filtering alarms on alarm focus](xref:ApplyingAlarmFiltersInTheAlarmConsole#filtering-alarms-on-alarm-focus).

- **Element \> Element name**: Shown by default. The name of the element.

- **Element \> Element description**: The description of the element.

- **Element \> Element type**: The element type, as defined in the protocol.

- **Element \> Polling IP**: The IP address that is used to communicate with the element.

- **Element \> Protocol**: The name of the protocol that the DMA uses to communicate with the element.

- **Parameter description**: Shown by default. User-friendly name of the parameter that triggered the alarm.

- **Parameter**: Name of the parameter that triggered the alarm.

- **Value**: Shown by default. The value of the parameter that triggered the alarm.

- **Time**: Shown by default. The date and time when the alarm event occurred on the device. This can also be the time when the alarm was escalated from a different alarm level.

- **Root time**: Shown by default. The date and time when the first of a series of related alarms occurred on the device.

- **Severity**: Shown by default. The severity level of the alarm, e.g. Warning, Major, Critical, etc.

- **Parameter key**: The display key of the parameter that triggered the alarm, in case of a table parameter.

- **Service impact**: Shown by default. The number of services the alarm has an impact on.

- **Services**: Shown by default. The services the alarm has an impact on.

- **RCA level**: Shown by default. Three values representing the distance to the most probable cause of the alarm for services, elements, and parameters respectively.

- **Alarm type**: Shown by default. One of the following alarm types:

  - **New alarm**: A new alarm event. This means that before this alarm event, the parameter was in normal state.
  
  - **Dropped from** ... : An alarm of which the severity level has dropped from a higher level.

  - **Escalated from** ... : An alarm of which the severity level has increase from a lower level.

  - **Flipped**: An alarm of which the severity level has gone from “low” (e.g. “critical low”) to “high” (e.g. “critical high”) or vice versa.

  - **Acknowledged**: An alarm of which a DataMiner user has taken ownership.

  - **Unresolved**: An alarm of which a DataMiner user has released ownership.

  - **Mask**: An alarm that has been masked by a DataMiner user.

  - **Unmask**: An alarm that has been unmasked by a DataMiner user.

  - **Comment** added: An alarm to which a comment has been added.

  - **Name** changed: An alarm caused by a parameter of which the name has been changed.
  
  - **Service** impact changed: An alarm for which the number of affected services has changed.

  - **View impact changed**: An alarm for which the affected views have changed.

- **Severity duration**: The length of time that the alarm has had its current severity

  > [!NOTE]
  > If history tracking is disabled, prior to DataMiner 10.0.5, no severity duration is displayed. This column is only available in history tabs from DataMiner 10.0.5 onwards, and only in case no filter is applied, or the filter is related to the element ID, DMA ID, element type, parameter ID, protocol ID or source ID. If the duration cannot be calculated, for example because the next alarm is not within the time span of the history tab, "N/A" will be displayed.

- **Owner**: Shown by default. The name of the DataMiner user who has taken ownership of the alarm. If no one has taken ownership of the alarm yet, the field remains empty.

- **Status**: The current status of the alarm:

  - **Open**: The alarm is active, and the parameter that caused the alarm is currently in an alarm state.

  - **Cleared**: The alarm is no longer active; the parameter that caused the alarm has returned to a normal state.

  - **Masked**: The alarm is active, but is currently masked; the parameter that caused the alarm is currently in an alarm state.

- **Extra status**: The masking status of the alarm. This column is available from DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.4 onwards. It indicates whether an alarm is masked or not.

- **User status**: The ownership status of the alarm:
  
  - **Not Assigned**: None of the DataMiner users have taken ownership of the alarm yet.

  - **Acknowledged**: A DataMiner user has taken ownership of the alarm.

  - **Unresolved**: A DataMiner user took ownership of the alarm but has already released that ownership.

- **Source**: The creator of the alarm. Usually, this is the DataMiner System, but it can for instance also be the Correlation Engine.

- **Alarm ID**: The unique ID that identifies the alarm record. This ID is for instance used to link alarms to trouble tickets.

- **Corrective action**: Description of corrective actions that should be taken, which can be customized with the information template.

- **Component info**: Contains more information about the nature of the alarm. Used in DataMiner Business Intelligence.

- **Key point**: The exact location in the signal chain where the error has occurred. Used in DataMiner Business Intelligence.

- **Interfaces**: The interfaces on which the alarm has an impact.
