# About alarms

Your DataMiner System continuously retrieves a wide variety of parameter values from all elements. When a parameter is monitored, each time a value is retrieved from an element, that value is compared to a user-defined threshold. Each time that threshold is violated, the DataMiner System will generate an alarm.

Most of the alarm functionality is available via the [Alarm Console](xref:Working_with_the_Alarm_Console).
