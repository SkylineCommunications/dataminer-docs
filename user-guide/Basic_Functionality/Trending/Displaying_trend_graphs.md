# Displaying trend graphs

There are several ways to access trend information:

- From an element card, service card or view card in DataMiner Cube. See [Accessing trend information from a card](xref:Accessing_trend_information_from_a_card).

- In the Trending module in DataMiner Cube. See [Accessing trend information from the Trending module](xref:Accessing_trend_information_from_the_Trending_module).

- In a DataMiner dashboard. See [Line & area chart](xref:LineAndAreaChart).

- In the Monitoring app. See [Element cards](xref:Element_Cards).

- In Visual Overview. For information on how to configure this, see [Linking a shape to a trend component](xref:Linking_a_shape_to_a_trend_component).

> - For more information on how to make sure a parameter is being trended, see [Trend templates](xref:About_trend_templates).
