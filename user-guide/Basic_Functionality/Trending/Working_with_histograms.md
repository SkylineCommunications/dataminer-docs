# Working with histograms

You can also view trend information in a histogram instead of in a trend graph. You can do so by [drilling down on a parameter on a card](xref:Viewing_trend_information_in_a_histogram_by_drilling_down_on_a_parameter) to access the parameter trend information, or by going to [the *HISTOGRAM* page of a view card](xref:Viewing_trend_information_in_a_histogram_on_a_view_card).

In a histogram:

- The X-axis represents the parameter value, shown in intervals.

- The Y-axis represents the number of times the parameter value occurred in the given time span.

The histogram right-click menu allows you to:

- Change the type of Y-axis from the default setting of absolute values (the number of occurrences) to relative values (% of total occurrences), by deselecting *Use absolute frequency*.

- Print the histogram.

- Save the histogram as an image.

- Copy the histogram as an image to the clipboard.

- Export the histogram to a CSV file.
