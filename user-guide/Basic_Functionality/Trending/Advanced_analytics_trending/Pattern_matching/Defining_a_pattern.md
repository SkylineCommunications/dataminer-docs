# Defining a pattern

Before DataMiner Analytics can track specific patterns, you first need to define those patterns:

## [From DataMiner 10.3.6/10.4.0 onwards](#tab/tabid-1)

In a trend graph showing trend information for one single parameter ([univariate patterns](xref:Working_with_pattern_matching#univariate-patterns)) or multiple parameters ([multivariate patterns](xref:Working_with_pattern_matching#multivariate-patterns)), **first select the section of the graph** that you identify as a recurring pattern. The way you can do so depends on the configuration of the trending user settings. See [Trending settings](xref:User_settings#trending-settings).

There are now two ways to define the pattern, a quick way where you use all default options, and a more extensive way where you can customize those options.<!-- RN 36114 -->

- To **quickly** define a pattern, click the tag icon, enter a name for the pattern definition, and click the check mark icon.

- To define a pattern with **custom** options:

  1. Click the tag icon and then click the cogwheel icon.

  1. Enter a name and (optionally) a description.

  1. If you want the patterns to be available for other DataMiner functionality, e.g. to [generate suggestion events](xref:Monitoring_of_trend_patterns) or via the Generic Query Interface in dashboards or low-code apps, select *Continuously detect patterns in the background*.

  1. If you want the patterns to be detected for all elements using the protocol instead of the current element only, next to *Apply to*, click the element name and select the protocol instead.

  1. For a table parameter, if you want the pattern to be selected for all rows in the table instead of the current row only, next to *Apply to*, select *all rows*.

## [Prior to DataMiner 10.3.6/10.4.0](#tab/tabid-2)

1. In a trend graph showing trend information for one single parameter, select the section of the graph that you identify as a recurring pattern.

   The way you can select a section of a graph depends on the configuration of the trending user settings. See [Trending settings](xref:User_settings#trending-settings).

1. Click the tag icon and enter a name for the pattern definition.

1. From DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards, for a table parameter, optionally clear the checkbox *\[Display key instance\] only* if you do not want the display key of the parameter to be taken into account to match the tag.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Prior to DataMiner 10.0.13, patterns can only be detected in the trending for a specific parameter ID, without taking any possible table index into account. Clearing the *\[Display key instance\] only* checkbox therefore results in the behavior of DataMiner versions prior to 10.0.13.

1. From DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards, optionally select *Generate an alarm when detected* to have DataMiner generate a “suggestion event” type of alarm whenever the pattern is detected. DataMiner will then also monitor the affected parameters in real time and save every pattern occurrence. For more information, see [Monitoring of trend patterns](xref:Monitoring_of_trend_patterns).

1. Click the check mark to save the pattern definition.
