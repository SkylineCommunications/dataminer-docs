# Working with Lite parameters

In addition to the “normal” way of displaying parameters, DataMiner can also display parameters in “Lite” mode. In Lite mode, parameters are shown in a more compact way and the parameter layout can be customized. There are also different options available than in normal mode.

To activate or deactivate Lite mode, go to the *Data Display* page of the user settings, and choose a different *Parameter Display Mode* in the selection box. For more information, see [User settings](xref:User_settings).
