# Matrix parameters

Matrix parameters combine a series of inputs and outputs in a matrix. An input and an output can be connected to one another with the crosspoints in the matrix.

By default, the inputs of a matrix parameter are displayed to the left of the matrix and the outputs are displayed above the matrix. However, from DataMiner 10.0.8 onwards, a different layout can be specified in the element protocol. You can also customize the matrix layout in Cube. To do so, right-click the matrix, click *Edit*, go to *layout*, and select the matrix layout you prefer in the drop-down list.

For more information on how to configure matrix parameters, see [Configuring matrix parameters](xref:Configuring_matrix_parameters).

> [!NOTE]
> On a matrix parameter, like on any other parameter, you can also apply alarm thresholds. If you do so, every crosspoint representing a monitored value will bear the color of its current alarm severity level. See [Configuring alarm thresholds for matrix parameters](xref:Configuring_normal_alarm_thresholds#configuring-alarm-thresholds-for-matrix-parameters).
