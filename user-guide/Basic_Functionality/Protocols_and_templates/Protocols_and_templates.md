# Protocols and templates

[Protocols](xref:Protocols1) serve as connectors, facilitating seamless communication between DataMiner Agents and data sources. These XML files contain instructions on data polling, real-time data display, default port settings, alarm thresholds, and more.

[Information templates](xref:Information_templates) allow you to customize parameter data within protocols without modifying the protocols themselves. [Alarm Templates](xref:About_alarm_templates) are XML files that define alarm thresholds for parameters within DataMiner protocols. [Trend templates](xref:About_trend_templates) enable you to define which parameters are logged in the trending database and specify the type of trending information to include.

> [!NOTE]
> The Protocols & Templates module often makes use of overlays, for example when you edit a protocol, alarm template or trend template. In that case, an undock icon is displayed in the top right corner, which can be used to open the overlay in a separate window. However, as long as this separate window is open, you will not be able to do any other actions in the Protocols & Templates module.
