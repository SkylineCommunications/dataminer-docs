# Working with the elements tab

While usually protocols or protocol versions are managed in the main *protocols & templates* tab, for a better overview of which elements use which protocols and versions, you can instead use the *elements* tab of the app.

This tab displays an overview of all elements in the system, with their associated protocol, protocol version, alarm template and trend template.

- A quick filter in the top right corner can be used to quickly find a particular element.

- If no template has been assigned to an element, instead of the alarm template or trend template name, *No Monitoring* or *No Trending* is displayed, respectively.

- If you select one or more elements with the same protocol and version (using the Ctrl key), you can quickly assign an alarm or trend template to these with the *Assign* buttons in the panel on the right.
