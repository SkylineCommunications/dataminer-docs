# Adding and deleting trend templates

## Creating a trend template

To create a new trend template:

1. Go to *Apps* > *Protocols & Templates*.

2. Select a protocol in the first column and a protocol version in the second column.

3. Right-click in the third column under *Trend*, and select *New*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To create a new trend template that is very similar to one that already exists, it can be handy to duplicate the existing template instead of creating a blank new template. To do so, instead of selecting *New*, select the template that is similar, and then select *Duplicate* in the right-click menu.

4. In the *New trend template* dialog box:

    1. Enter a template name.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Some characters cannot be used in template names. For more information, see [Naming of elements, services, views, etc.](xref:NamingConventions#naming-of-elements-services-views-etc).

    2. Check if the protocol and protocol version are correct and adapt if necessary.

    3. Click *OK*.

    The template editor now opens, where you can further configure the trend template.
