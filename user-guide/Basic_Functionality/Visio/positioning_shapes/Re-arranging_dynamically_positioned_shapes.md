# Re-arranging dynamically positioned shapes

When, in a Visio drawing, shapes have been positioned dynamically based on properties, you can re-arrange those shapes manually.

1. Right-click the page, and select *Arrange*. This will activate the special "Arrange" mode.
1. Re-arrange the shapes using drag-and-drop.
1. When you have finished re-arranging the shapes, click *Apply*.

> [!NOTE]
> In DataMiner versions prior to 9.0.0, users need to have the *Edit Visio drawings* permission to use this functionality. From version 9.0.0 onwards, this is no longer required.
