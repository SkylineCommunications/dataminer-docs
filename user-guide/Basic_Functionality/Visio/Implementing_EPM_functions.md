# Implementing EPM functions

EPM elements (formerly known as CPE Managers) are used in order to manage very high volumes of devices. Several configuration options are available in Visio for this kind of DataMiner element.

This section consists of the following topics:

- [Linking a Visio page to an EPM chain](xref:Linking_a_Visio_page_to_an_EPM_chain)

- [Linking a Visio page to an EPM filter section field](xref:Linking_a_Visio_page_to_an_EPM_filter_section_field)

- [Preventing navigation to the EPM interface when a shape is clicked](xref:Preventing_navigation_to_the_EPM_interface_when_a_shape_is_clicked)

- [Turning a shape into a button that opens a KPI window](xref:Turning_a_shape_into_a_button_that_opens_a_KPI_window)

- [Specifying additional tables for the EPM Details pane](xref:Specifying_additional_tables_for_the_EPM_Details_pane)

- [Specifying an EPM parameter that can be used to filter](xref:Specifying_an_EPM_parameter_that_can_be_used_to_filter)
