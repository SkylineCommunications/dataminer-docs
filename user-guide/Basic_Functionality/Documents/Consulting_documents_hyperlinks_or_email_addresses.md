# Consulting documents, hyperlinks, or email addresses

On the left side of the Documents module, a tree view shows a folder structure containing all available documents.

To open a document or a hyperlink, or to send an email to an email address stored in DataMiner:

1. Click through the folder structure until you find the document, hyperlink, or email address, or search for it using the search functionality in the navigation pane.

1. Double-click the document, hyperlink, or email address.

   Alternatively, in the Documents module, you can also select one or more items, right-click them and select *Open*.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - To download a document to your local computer, right-click it in the Documents module and select *Save*.
> - To quickly find a specific document, you can use the filter box in the top-right corner (available from DataMiner 10.2.0/10.1.5 onwards).
> - The *Open* and *Save* options are not available for documents in the [Elements folder](xref:Managing_the_document_folders#the-elements-folder) for a specific element.
