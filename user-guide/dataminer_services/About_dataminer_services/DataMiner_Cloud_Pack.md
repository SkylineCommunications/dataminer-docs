# DataMiner Cloud Pack

The DataMiner Cloud Pack is a package that includes the necessary [DataMiner Extension Modules (DxMs)](xref:DataMinerExtensionModules) to enable dataminer.services capabilities.

On [DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/dataminer-cloud-pack/), you can download a version of the cloud pack with or without .NET 8. Separate cloud packs are also available for a proxy or DMZ setup.

> [!TIP]
> For information about which versions of these modules are included in each version of the Cloud Pack, see [Cloud Pack change log](xref:Cloud_Pack_change_log).
