# DVE export rules not working correctly

## Affected version

From DataMiner 10.4.0/10.4.1 onwards.

## Cause

No clear root cause has been established yet.

## Fix

No fix is available yet.

## Issue description

Upon transitioning to a new version of a DVE protocol, the functionality of DVE export rules may become erratic. The severity of the problem can vary based on the nature of the export rules implemented.

For example, an export rule designed to designate the default page of all DVE protocols as "Task Manager" may reset, causing the default page to revert to the standard default page prior to the rule being configured.
