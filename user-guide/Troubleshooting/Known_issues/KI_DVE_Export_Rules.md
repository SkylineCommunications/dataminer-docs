# DVE export rules not working correctly

## Affected version

From DataMiner 10.4.0/10.4.1 onwards.

## Cause

No clear root cause has been established yet.

## Fix

No fix is available yet.

## Issue description

Upon transitioning to a new version of a DVE protocol, the functionality of DVE export rules may become erratic. The severity of the problem can vary based on the nature of the export rules implemented.

For example, an export rule designed to designate the default page of all DVE protocols as "Task Manager" will revert back to its previous default page before the rule was configured.
