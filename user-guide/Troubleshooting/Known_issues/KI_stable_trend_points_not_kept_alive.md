# Stable trend points not kept alive

## Affected versions

- DataMiner Main Release versions from 10.2.0 [CU8] onwards
- DataMiner Feature Release versions from 10.2.10 onwards

## Cause

DataMiner should regularly rewrite stable trend data points to keep them alive, but this does not happen correctly.

## Fix

No fix is available yet.

## Issue description

Trend graphs for parameters with few value changes show "No Data". This mainly occurs with real-time trending.
