# Consulting the DataMiner logs in DataMiner Cube

In the System Center module, the *Logging* page provides access to the various log files available in the DMS. On this page, you can consult log files in order to check the system health and troubleshoot any problems.

To access the *Logging* page, in DataMiner Cube, go to *Apps* > *System Center* > *Logging*.

The page consists of four tabs:

- *Cube*: see [Cube logging](xref:Cube_logging)

- *Communication*: see [Communication logging](xref:Communication_logging)

- *DataMiner*: see [DataMiner logging](xref:DataMiner_logging)

- *Elements*: see [Elements logging](xref:Elements_logging)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - You can adjust the maximum total size of the log files in a DMS. See [Changing the maximum size of DataMiner log files](xref:Changing_the_maximum_size_of_DataMiner_log_files).
> - The number of log entries that are kept and the general log level are determined in the Cube computer settings. For more information, see [Computer settings](xref:Computer_settings).
