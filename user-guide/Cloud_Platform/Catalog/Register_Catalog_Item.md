# Registering a Catalog item

In order to make a [new Catalog item](#registering-a-catalog-item-with-the-api) or a [new version of a Catalog item](#registering-a-new-version-with-the-api) available in the [DataMiner Catalog](https://catalog.dataminer.services/), you need to register it using the Catalog API.

When you register a new Catalog item, it will only become available for the registered organization, and it will be marked as *private* in the Catalog to indicate this.

A Catalog item is identified by a unique ID (GUID), which you will need to provide yourself.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The API calls are authenticated using [organization keys](xref:Managing_DCP_keys#organization-keys). Make sure you use a key that has the *Register Catalog items* permission and add it to the HTTP request in a header called **Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key**. Also, note that you need to have the *Owner* role in order to access or create organization keys.

> [!TIP]
> For practical examples, refer to the tutorials [Registering a new connector in the Catalog](xref:Tutorial_Register_Catalog_Item), [Registering a new version of a connector in the Catalog](xref:Tutorial_Register_Catalog_Version), and [Registering a new version of a connector in the Catalog using GitHub Actions](xref:Tutorial_Register_Catalog_Version_GitHub_Actions).

## Registering a Catalog item with the API

The register API call allows you to create or update a Catalog item. To add a version after you have successfully registered an item, see [Registering a new version with the API](#registering-a-new-version-with-the-api).

### API Definition

For a complete definition of the API, go to [Key Catalog API Swagger](https://catalogapi-prod.cca-prod.aks.westeurope.dataminer.services/swagger/index.html?urls.primaryName=Key+Catalog+API+v2.0).

This page also provides a quick way to execute the call: Expand the "catalog/register" item, and click the *Try it out* button.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Clicking the *Try it out* button will execute the register call on the production Catalog.

The [Swagger.json](https://catalogapi-prod.cca-prod.aks.westeurope.dataminer.services/swagger/key-catalog_2.0/swagger.json) can be used by e.g. [Swagger CodeGen](https://swagger.io/docs/open-source-tools/swagger-codegen/) or [AutoRest](https://azure.github.io/autorest/generate/) to generate client code.

### HTTP method

PUT

### Body

The body of the request should be of type **multipart/form-data** and must contain a key of type **File** with the name **file**.

## Registering a new version with the API

The register version API call allows you to create a new version for a Catalog item.

> [!NOTE]
> A version can only be registered once. Registration will fail if you try to register an existing version number of a Catalog item.

Route parameter "catalogId" is the ID of the Catalog item of which a new version is registered, which is the same as the ID used to [register the Catalog item](#registering-a-catalog-item-with-the-api). This must be a valid GUID.

To obtain this ID for an existing Catalog item, navigate to its details page in the [Catalog](https://catalog.dataminer.services/). The ID is the last part of the URL.
