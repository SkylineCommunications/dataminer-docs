# Changing the email address associated with your dataminer.services account

If you already have a dataminer.services account, but you want to start using a different email address, you will need to re-register by creating a new dataminer.services account and then have us transfer your existing data on DataMiner Dojo.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you change the email address associated with your account, any progress you have made on courses and quizzes in the [Learning module](https://community.dataminer.services/learning/) will be lost, so you will need to start over in this module. Also, any comments you have made in the [Questions module](https://community.dataminer.services/questions/) will still be displayed as posted with your old account.

1. Go to [dataminer.services](https://dataminer.services/).

1. Make sure you are logged out by clicking the user icon in the top-right corner and selecting *Sign out*.

1. Sign in as if you were a new user, using the new email address. See [Logging on](xref:Logging_on_to_the_DataMiner_Cloud_Platform#logging-on).

   This will create a new account linked to the new email address.

1. Visit [community.dataminer.services](https://community.dataminer.services/) with the new account.

1. Contact [back.office@skyline.be](mailto:back.office@skyline.be?subject=Request%20to%20transfer%20my%20DataMiner%20Dojo%20data&body=Hi%2C%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20transfer%20my%20DataMiner%20Dojo%20data.%0D%0AThe%20accounts%20involved%20are%20listed%20below%3A%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom%3A%0D%0A%3Cfill%20in%20email%20address%3E%0D%0A%0D%0ATo%20(new%20account)%3A%0D%0A%3Cfill%20in%20email%20address%3E%0D%0A) to have your existing data transferred to the new account.

   You will be asked for confirmation before the data are transferred.
