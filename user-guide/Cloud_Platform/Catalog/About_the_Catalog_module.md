# About the Catalog module

As part of dataminer.services, the Catalog module allows Skyline customers and DataMiner Strategic Partners to browse and deploy available DataMiner connectors, packages, Visio drawings, Automation scripts, dashboards, and more.

To access the Catalog module:

1. Go to <https://dataminer.services/>, and [sign in](xref:Logging_on_to_the_DataMiner_Cloud_Platform).

1. On the dataminer.services landing page, click *Catalog*.

> [!TIP]
> From DataMiner 10.2.9/10.3.0 onwards, you can navigate directly to the catalog from DataMiner Cube by selecting *Catalog* in the *Apps* pane.
