# Controlling remote access with the Admin app

When a DMS is cloud-connected, you can use the URL created for you during registration (e.g. ``https://ziine-skyline.on.dataminer.services/``) to access the DataMiner web apps from anywhere.

## Finding the remote access URL

After you have registered, you can find the URL on the dataminer.services home page. In the DataMiner Systems section, the URL is displayed right underneath the name of the connected DataMiner System. You can also directly navigate to the URL from this section.

## Enabling or disabling remote access

If you have the Owner or Admin role on DCP, you can enable or disable the remote access feature.

1. In the Admin app, check whether the correct organization is mentioned in the header bar.

1. If a different organization should be selected, click the organization selector in the top-right corner and select the organization in the list.

1. In the pane on the left, under *DataMiner Systems*, select your DataMiner System and select the *Overview* page.

1. Click the *Edit* button at the top of the page.

1. Set the *Remote Access* setting to *On* or *Off*, depending on whether you want this to be enabled or not.
