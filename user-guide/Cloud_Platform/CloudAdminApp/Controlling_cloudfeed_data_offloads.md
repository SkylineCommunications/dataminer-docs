# Controlling cloud feed data offloads

When a DMS is connected to the DataMiner Cloud Platform, it will start offloading alarm and change point events to the cloud. This data will then be used to improve DataMiner Analytics features.

If you have the Owner or Admin role on DCP, you can enable or disable these offloads.

To do so:

1. In the Admin app, check whether the correct organization is mentioned in the header bar.

1. If a different organization should be selected, click the organization selector ![Organization selector](~/user-guide/images/Cloud_Admin_Selector_icon.png) in the top-right corner and select the organization in the list.

1. In the pane on the left, under *DataMiner Systems*, select your DataMiner System and select the *Overview* page.

1. Click the *Edit* button at the top of the page.

1. Set the *Allow CloudFeed Data Offload* setting to *On* or *Off*, depending on whether you want this to be enabled or not.
