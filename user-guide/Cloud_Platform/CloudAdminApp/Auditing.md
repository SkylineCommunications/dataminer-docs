# Consulting dataminer.services audit logs

If you have the Owner or Admin role for an organization on dataminer.services, you can consult dataminer.services audit logs on the *Organization* > *Audit* page in the Admin app.

This page shows an overview of all the security-related events on dataminer.services that have happened for all systems connected to dataminer.services within your organization.

To quickly find something in the potentially vast number of logs, use the filters at the top of the page.
