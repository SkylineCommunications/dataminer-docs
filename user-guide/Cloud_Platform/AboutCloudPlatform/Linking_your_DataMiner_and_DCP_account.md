# Linking your DataMiner account to your dataminer.services account

To make use of some dataminer.services functionality, for example to interact with DataMiner using the Teams bot, your DataMiner account has to be linked to your dataminer.services account.

To link your accounts:

1. Go to <https://dataminer.services>.

1. In the pane that mentions your DMS, click *Link account*. This will open a new tab.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If this option is not available, and "..." is shown in the top-right corner of the pane, your accounts have already been linked. In that case, you can remove the link again by selecting ... > *Unlink account*.

1. In the new tab, if the displayed dataminer.services account and DataMiner System are correct, click *Continue to log on*.

1. Log on with the DataMiner account you want to link to your dataminer.services account.

1. Click *Link accounts*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is not possible to link two different dataminer.services accounts to the same DataMiner user.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also link your account directly via the DataMiner Teams bot. See [DataMiner Teams bot](xref:DataMiner_Teams_bot)
