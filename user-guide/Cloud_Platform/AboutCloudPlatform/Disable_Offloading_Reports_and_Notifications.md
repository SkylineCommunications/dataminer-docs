# Disabling reports and notifications offloading

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you disable offloading of reports and notifications via DataMiner SupportAssistant, Skyline will not be able to provide maintenance and support.

From version 1.3.1 of the [DataMiner SupportAssistant](xref:DataMinerExtensionModules#supportassistant) DataMiner Extension Module (DxM) onwards, this DxM also takes care of offloading reports and notifications generated by SLWatchDog to dataminer.services to improve the maintenance and support experience.

By default, the *FileWatcherOptions:Configs* array in the app settings is configured to offload both reports and notifications. To disable offloads, you can remove entries from that array by overriding the configuration on each server.

To **disable all offloading**:

1. On each server where DataMiner SupportAssistant is installed, in the folder `C:\Program Files\Skyline Communications\DataMiner SupportAssistant`, create or adjust the override *appsettings.custom.json* with the following contents:

   ```json
   {
      "FileWatcherOptions": {
         "Configs": []
      }
   }
   ```
  
1. Restart *DataMiner SupportAssistant* on each server for the changes to take effect.

> [!NOTE]
> At present, this feature runs in parallel with the old method of offloading via an SMTP server. This old method of offloading cannot yet be disabled.
