# About DataMiner

## Open and fully independent software platform

DataMiner is a standard, proven and very widely adopted and endorsed, open and fully independent software platform. It includes:

- [Data ingest & control](#data-ingest--control)
- [Data processing & workflow](#data-processing--workflow)
- [Data consumption & control surface](#data-consumption--control-surface)

### Data ingest & control

DataMiner has powerful data ingest and control plane capabilities, enabling operators to ingest data from any product, irrespective of the interface or protocol required, transparently across any vendor or domain boundaries, covering hardware products, software products and cloud services alike. DataMiner users enjoy the unconditional guarantee that they can ingest any data from across their entire operation in a secure, scalable, and fully standardized way. Because of the open architecture, anybody can design, build, and deploy new connectors for that purpose, fully supporting DevOps operations.

This aspect of the DataMiner System is all about creating a fully standardized and real-time updated digital twin of the entire underlying operation. This unique ability differentiates DataMiner from the proliferation of general-purpose data collection solutions. DataMiner really stands in a class of its own, providing out of the box what would be otherwise a complex, cumbersome and expensive mashup of disparate software components.

### Data processing & workflow

DataMiner features advanced out-of-the-box and fully standardized open-architecture data processing (e.g. standard advanced fault and performance management, AI-based data processing and analytics, data aggregation, industry-standard big data storage, uniform real-time service modeling and management, and much more) as well as sophisticated end-to-end workflow automation capabilities (e.g. standard orchestration, unified resource management, transparent process automation, and much more). This leverages out-of-the-box integrations with the above-mentioned standard digital twin of the operation, resulting in fast, efficient and continuous deployment of solutions irrespective of new products and data sources to be connected in the future.

### Data consumption & control surface

DataMiner includes fully standardized, out-of-the-box, open-architecture data consumption and control surface tools (e.g. standard graphical bubble-up and drill-down UIs, control surfaces such as data display and button control panels, signal routing UIs, KPI dashboards, RF spectrum UIs, no-code user-definable apps, and much more) as well as powerful, standardized, professionally secured, scalable APIs that make it possible to plug in any other third-party data consumption or control apps. This leverages the underlying standardized digital twin of the operation and enables fast and continuous integration of the end-to-end operation.

## Architecture

The pronounced open architecture of DataMiner enables anybody, including developers, end users and any third-party system integrators and ICT contractors, to design powerful end-to-end solutions in a continuous fashion, enabling a DevOps style of operation and business. This includes connecting the DataMiner platform with new data sources and products on the fly, creating and deploying new data processing routines and logic, and designing and operating data consumption and control surfaces for end users.

In that sense, the DataMiner platform can be compared to a Microsoft O365, SAP or Salesforce platform, providing a full-featured, out-of-the-box, highly integrated, standardized and proven ecosystem, where users can easily plug in their data sources and any third-party products they rely on for their operation, and focus on creating a unified, secure, scalable, and standardized open environment to consume and leverage their operational data to manage and orchestrate their services end to end, along with automation of their end-to-end technical, operational and business workflows. In addition, DataMiner also provides easy, secure and scalable access to fully standardized data for all types of consumers, both through standard-included DataMiner applications and third-party data consumption products or apps.

DataMiner focuses on providing a highly standardized, out-of-the-box experience when it comes to data ingest, processing, flow, and utilization, while providing users complete freedom to focus their time and efforts on tailoring this experience and evolving it DevOps-style in line with their specific operational and business needs (e.g. ingesting data from their specific products, modeling their specific services, crafting their specific UIs and control surfaces, creating their unique workflows, etc.). This is essential for success, because every operation and environment is unique, and excellence can only be achieved if there is sufficient flexibility in the tooling that is leveraged.

The digital twin of an operation in DataMiner runs transparently across any vendor, technology, or domain boundaries of the operation. It provides a real-time and fully standardized representation of all managed assets, irrespective of hardware, software, or cloud services, along with powerful standard modeling of all relationships, such as physical and logical connectivity, dependencies and much more. All standard DataMiner platform capabilities come fully integrated with those digital twin objects, so that they can tap into the data of the digital twin objects or control those objects out of the box, independent of the underlying technology or interfaces.

DataMiner can be deployed as an on-premises platform, in a private or public cloud, or in a hybrid setup combining the two.
