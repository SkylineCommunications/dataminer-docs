# Contributing to the DataMiner docs

Welcome to the docs.dataminer.services contributor guide!

Our documentation is open to contributions from any user. Contributions are created, reviewed, and merged via GitHub. This guide will explain how you can add and review contributions, ranging from simple changes to a single page, to larger changes where entire sections of the documentation are added or modified.

> [!TIP]
> Are you a member of the DataMiner DevOps Professional Program? You can earn points by proposing changes or pointing out issues in the documentation! Find out [how many DevOps Points you can earn](xref:DevOps_Points).

## General guidelines

- Use **US English** spelling when you contribute to the DataMiner documentation.

- Try to conform to the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/) as much as possible.

- Use DocFX Flavored Markdown (DFM). If you are unfamiliar with this syntax, see [Markdown syntax](xref:CTB_Markdown_Syntax).

- Do not make changes to the root folder of the repository, to the *.github* folder, or to the *templates* folder. As a rule, such changes will be rejected.
