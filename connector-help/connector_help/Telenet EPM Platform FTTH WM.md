# Telenet EPM Platform FTTH WM

This is a configuration manager connector designed to process a single provisioning file per DMS (Device Management System) for passive components, generating unique IDs for entities within the file.

The **Telenet EPM Platform FTTH WM** connector is responsible for generating a CSV file for each ONT (Optical Network Terminal) change after reading from a Kafka stream topic.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual connection

This driver uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

When creating a new Telenet EPM Platform FTTH WM element, you must define the following parameters in the **Configuration** page:
Import Settings

- Entity Import Directory: Set the generic GPON entity import path used across the EPM Solution.

Export Settings

- Entity Export Directory: Specify the generic GPON entity export path used throughout the EPM Solution.

System Credentials

- System Username: The username with access to the remote directory. If no domain is provided, the domain from the element's DMA location will be used.
- System Password: The password of the user for accessing the remote directory.

Topic Kafka Settings

- Entity Export Directory: Specify the path where KAFKA Stream update files are located.

Synchronization File Settings

- File Sync Offloading Time: Define the timing for offloading ONT statuses.

### Provisioning

The provisioning of the EPM Solution is sequential and involves the following components:

- **Skyline EPM Platform FTTH** as Front-end element: Responsible for the top-level data aggregation and for displaying the topologies.
- **Skyline EPM Platform FTTH** as Back-end element: In charge of the data aggregation from the collectors.
- **Skyline EPM Platform FTTH Collector**: In charge of the ONT data aggregation from an OLT.
- **Telenet EPM Platform FTTH WM**: Creates compatible files regarding the passives available within the GPON infrastructure and the KAFKA OLT KPIs.

## How to use

The Telenet EPM Platform FTTH WM is configured to manage **ONT** statuses by extracting and parsing **GZIP** files generated by a Kafka consumer element. These statuses are then forwarded to **OLT** elements.
A file containing ONT changes is offloaded daily, encompassing all ONTs in the cluster.
