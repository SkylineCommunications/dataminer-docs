# Tandberg nCompass Device

Tandberg nCompass is an open systems network monitoring solution that supervises and monitors devices and systems throughout the network.

The top-level network monitoring function allows early visibility and identification of network and MPEG service issues.

The 4.0.1.x version is compatible with nCompass versions 5.x, 6.x and 8.x

The Tandberg nCompass uses SNMP and serial communication to get information about devices and alarms. It uses SOAP to display the profiles and streams. The schedule of these transport streams and system streams is displayed in a table. The connector allows the user to clear the schedule starting from a desired time, or to activate profiles. Events are retrieved from the device and an action is automatically executed if an event has occurred.
