## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This driver uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Initialization

No extra configuration is needed.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

This driver allows you to configure and monitor two channels, A and B, for video frame-rate conversion.

## Notes

The current version only supports video. Audio is not supported yet, as FOR-A has not yet made audio support available through SNMP for the current device model.
