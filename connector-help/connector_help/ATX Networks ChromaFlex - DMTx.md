# ATX Networks ChromaFlex - DMTx

ATX supplies traditional directly modulated 1310nm transmitter modules in optical output powers ranging from 4-14 dBm.

Similar to the DWDM DMTs, the 1310nm versions are available as a 3-output version with a common broadcast input and 3 narrowcast inputs (DMT3), or a 4-output unicast version (DMT4).

At up to 16 transmitters per RU, DMT 1310nm transmitters are ideal for upgrading the capacity of existing optical links to 1.218 MHz and reclaiming rack space at the same time.
