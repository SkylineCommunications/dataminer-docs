# WISI Optopus Passive Devices

The **WISI Optopus Passive Devices** LDxx are passive filter modules. With this SNMP driver, you can control and monitor the parameters of the card incorporated in the chassis of the **WISI Optopus**.

With the WISI Optopus platform, any module can be mounted into any slot, so that fully customized individual configuration is possible, specific to the intended application.

Every card inserted into one of the 14 slots will generate its own individual **Dynamic Virtual Element** (**DVE**)when this option is enabled.

This driver is automatically generated by the driver WISI Optopus.
