Monitoring and control of card status and parameters is provided locally at the card edge and remotely via VistaLink Pro capability.

An SNMP connection is used in order to successfully retrieve and configure the information of the device. There are also different possibilities available for alarm monitoring and trending.This connector is automatically generated by the parent connector [Evertz 7x00 General Platform](xref:Connector_help_Evertz_7x00_General_Platform).
