# Miranda IControl General - HCP-1801

The **HCP-1801** control probe integrates many advanced features for the monitoring of both video and embedded audio signals, including a new macro-block detection option. It offers complete real-time measurement and analysis of signal parameters, as well as flexible alarm thresholds and user-defined profiles. In addition, the probe functions as a distribution amplifier, with a single input and four HD or SD reclocked outputs. Used in conjunction with Grass Valley's **Miranda iControl**, the **HCP-1801** allows users to see the signals they are monitoring. The probe generates real-time streaming video and audio level meters for transmission over IP networks.
