# ATX Networks MP3 - QMP200

The **QMP200 MAXNET II** modules are return RF/IF amplifiers, which offer two gain versions (20dB and 28dB) that are determined at the time of ordering. The QMP200 amplifier is a single-stage amplifier. The QMP200 amplifiers are dual-width, taking up two slots in the Active MAXNET II Chassis. They are powered through a hot-swapping backplane in the Active MAXNET II Chassis. An appropriate MAXNET II Power Supply in the Active MAXNET II Chassis powers these modules. The QMP200 modules feature the standard MAXNET II functionality including high-density packaging through the use of MCX coaxial cable connectors in conjunction with Mini-RG59 coaxial cable.
