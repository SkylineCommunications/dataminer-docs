## Installation and configuration

### Creation

The element using this connector can be automatically created by the parent element using the **Axon ACP** connector, but it can also be a standalone element.

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device, being the slot number of the card.

#### Serial Broadcast Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device.

## Usage

This element has the following data pages:

- **General**: This page displays general information about the card: **Card Name**, **Card Description**, **SW Revision**, **HW Revision**, etc.
- **Status**
- **Preset**
- **Settings**
- **Alarm Priority**: This page displays the event messages of the card, i.e. special messages generated asynchronously on the card.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The Axon ACP protocol supports the usage of DCF and can only be used on a DMA with **8.5.4** as the minimum version.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).

### Interfaces

#### Physical Interfaces

- **SDI Input**: A single fixed interface of type **input**.
- **SDI Output 1**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.
- **SDI Output 2**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.
- **SDI Reclocked Output**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.
- **G/Y/CVBS Output**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.
- **B/Pb/C Output**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.
- **R/Pr/Y Output**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.

### Connections

#### Internal Connections

When a DVE child element is created, the following connections are established:

- Between **SDI Input** and **SDI Output 1**.
- Between **SDI Input** and **SDI Output 2**.
- Between **SDI Input** and **SDI Reclocked Output**.
- Between **SDI Input** and **G/Y/CVBS Output**.
- Between **SDI Input** and **B/Pb/C Output**.
- Between **SDI Input** and **R/Pr/Y Output**.
