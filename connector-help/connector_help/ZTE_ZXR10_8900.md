## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: The bus address of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

## How to use

This connector is intended to be used as a monitoring platform that allows you to check the status of the interfaces, the temperature reported, the CPU and memory used, and many other parameters.

On the General page, a toggle button allows you to enable/disable the displaying of the Debug page. That page contains tables for internal use.

The General page also has a Polling Control subpage where you can activate/deactivate the polling of some parameters if necessary.
