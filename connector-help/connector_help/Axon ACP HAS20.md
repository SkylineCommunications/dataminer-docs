# Axon ACP HAS20

The HAS20 is a high-definition 8-channel preset-based audio shuffler with 4 local AES/EBU inputs.

The **Axon ACP HAS20** driver can be used to display and configure information related to this device.

## About

This driver can be automatically generated by the driver **Axon ACP**.

There are different possibilities available for **alarm monitoring** and **trending**.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

The element using this driver can be automatically created by the parent element using the **Axon ACP** driver, but it can also be a standalone element.

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This driver uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device, being the slot number of the card.

#### Serial Broadcast Connection

This driver uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device.

## Usage

This element has the following data pages:

- **General**: This page displays general information about the card: **Card Name**, **Card Description**, **SW Revision**, **HW Revision**, etc.
- **Status**
- **Settings**
- **AES**
- **Audio**
- **Embedder**
- **Embedder A**
- **Embedder B**
- **Alarm Priority**: This page displays the event messages of the card, i.e. special messages generated asynchronously on the card.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The Axon ACP protocol supports the usage of DCF and can only be used on a DMA with **8.5.4** as the minimum version.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner Third Party protocols (for instance a manager).
