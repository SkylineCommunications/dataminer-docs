# Oi Brazil DSLAM Platform Manager

The **Oi Brazil DSLAM Platform Manager** allows the aggregation of KPIs and dynamic PING statistics from **Oi Brazil DSLAM Collectors** deployed as part of the Oi Brazil infrastructure.

## About

CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) connectors are designed to poll large amounts of data from the deployed infrastructure. This is done using a front-end CPE Manager element and several back-end CPE Manager elements at the same time. Both of these types of elements use the same CPE Manager connector.

The **Oi Brazil** system has one front-end element (FE) and several back-end elements (BEs). The FE is responsible for the top-level data aggregation from the different BEs. Each BE is responsible for the aggregation of a section of the data from the collectors

Topologies describe the connections in the CPE diagram and chains display topology views. The **Oi Brazil DSLAM Platform Manager** implements five chains:

1. Location

   - **DSLAM**
   - **City**
   - **State**
   - **Sub-Region**
   - **Super-Region**

1. Model

   - **DSLAM**
   - **Model**

1. Station

   - **DSLAM**
   - **Station**

1. Quick

   - Allows you to select the filter DSLAM, City, State, Sub-Region, Super-Region, Model or Station.

1. Configuration

   - Allows you to set up the different configuration options.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### Virtual connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Configuration

For each back-end element, the following data should be configured:

1. Role (back-end)
1. File import path.
1. List of registered collectors.

For each front-end element, the following data should be configured:

1. Role (front-end)
1. File import path.
1. List of registered back-end elements.
1. List of all the collectors in the system.

### Provisioning

The solution requires the pre-provisioning of configuration data. The necessary data will be contained in a .csv file and placed in a specific location (i.e. the Import File Path). The following steps need to be performed:

1. Load the .csv file provided by the customer in the front-end element (FE). Based on the number of registered back-end elements (BEs), the FE splits the loaded data and export a .csv for each BE. The division of the data is done in a such a way that the load is distributed between the different BEs, and each BE is in charge of a section of the data that does not overlap with another BE. Each BE is responsible for a subset of the available sub-regions.
1. Load the .csv files generated by the FE in the BEs. Each BE distributes its assigned DSLAMs between its registered collectors and exports a .csv for each collector.
1. Load the .csv files generated by the BEs in the collectors.

## Usage

The CPE Manager's Data Display pages are not intended to be opened. Instead, the configuration should be performed through a Visio file or via multiple set.

When the manager element card is open in Cube, the CPE interface will be displayed, with different chains providing a different topology view.

When the filters (on the left side) are filled in, the topology diagram view is displayed.

When a KPI item is selected in this diagram view, a pop-up window with parameters opens.

### KPIs

The following Key Point Indicators (KPIs) are calculated on the different levels.
