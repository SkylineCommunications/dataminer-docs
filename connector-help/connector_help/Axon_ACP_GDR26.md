## Installation and configuration

### Creation

The element using this driver can be automatically created by the parent element using the **Axon ACP** driver, but it can also be a standalone element.

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This driver uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device, being the slot number of the card.

#### Serial Broadcast Connection

This driver uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device.

## Usage

This element has the following data pages:

- **General**: This page displays general information about the card: **Card Name**, **Card Description**, **SW Revision**, **HW Revision**, etc.
- **I/O**
- **Settings**
- **Alarm Priority**: This page displays the event messages of the card, i.e. special messages generated asynchronously on the card.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

The Axon ACP protocol supports the usage of DCF and can only be used on a DMA with **8.5.4** as the minimum version.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner Third Party protocols (for instance a manager).

### Interfaces

#### Physical Interfaces

- **SDI Input A**: A single fixed interface of type **input**.
- **SDI Input B**: A single fixed interface of type **input**.
- **SDI Output A1**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.
- **SDI Output A2**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.
- **SDI Output A3**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.
- **SDI Output B1**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.
- **SDI Output B2**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.
- **SDI Output B3**: A single fixed interface of type **output**.

#### Virtual Interfaces

- **Reclocker 1**: A single fixed interface of type **inout**.
- **Reclocker 2**: A single fixed interface of type **inout**.

### Connections

#### Internal Connections

When a DVE child element is created, the following connections are established:

- Between **Reclocker 1** and **SDI Output A1**.
- Between **Reclocker 1** and **SDI Output A2**.
- Between **Reclocker 1** and **SDI Output A3**.
- Between **Reclocker 2** and **SDI Output B1**.
- Between **Reclocker 2** and **SDI Output B2**.
- Between **Reclocker 2** and **SDI Output B3**.

Depending on the state of the **Input Selection**, the following connections are established:

- **Normal:**

- Between **SDI Input A** and **Reclocker 1**.
  - Between **SDI Input B** and **Reclocker 2**.

- **Crossed:**

- Between **SDI Input A** and **Reclocker 2**.
  - Between **SDI Input B** and **Reclocker 1**.
