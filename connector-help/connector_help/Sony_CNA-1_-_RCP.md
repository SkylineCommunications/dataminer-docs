# Sony CNA-1 - RCP

The CNA-1 camera control network adaptor enables third-party system products to control Sony system cameras over IP networks. CNA-1 works as a protocol converter, translating the original 700PTP protocol of Sony cameras to and from Simple Protocol to allow the cameras to work easily with third-party devices.

This connector is automatically generated by the parent connector [Sony CNA-1](xref:Connector_help_Sony_CNA-1), range 1.0.0.x. It can be used to display information related to each RCP reported by the Sony CNA-1 parent element.
